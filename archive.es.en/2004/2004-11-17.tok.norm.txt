german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler hopes to turn around its loss-making smart unit by establishing a close partnership between the ultra-small car and french car maker peugeot , the süddeutsche zeitung reported on wednesday .
the newspaper quoted sources close to daimlerchrysler as saying the car maker hoped to work together with peugeot to develop two- and four-seater small cars .
however , a spokesman for smart dismissed the report as " completely false " and " totally unfounded . "
süddeutsche zeitung also said that daimlerchrysler would , in the mid-term , end its cooperation with japanese maker mitsubishi motors -lrb- mmc -rrb- which builds the four-seater smart in the netherlands and the mitsubishi colt .
but that information was also wrong , the smart spokesman said .
" our joint projects are doing very well .
there wo n't be any separation from mmc , " he said .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was looking for a partner for the smart car because unit sales are not sufficient to achieve favorable production costs at present .
süddeutsche zeitung said the smart division would run up a loss this year of more than € 400 million -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler hopes to turn around its loss-making smart unit by establishing a close partnership between the ultra-small car and french car maker peugeot , the süddeutsche zeitung reported on wednesday .
the newspaper quoted sources close to daimlerchrysler as saying the car maker hoped to work together with peugeot to develop two- and four-seater small cars .
however , a spokesman for smart dismissed the report as " completely false " and " totally unfounded . "
süddeutsche zeitung also said that daimlerchrysler would , in the mid-term , end its cooperation with japanese maker mitsubishi motors -lrb- mmc -rrb- which builds the four-seater smart in the netherlands and the mitsubishi colt .
but that information was also wrong , the smart spokesman said .
" our joint projects are doing very well .
there wo n't be any separation from mmc , " he said .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was looking for a partner for the smart car because unit sales are not sufficient to achieve favorable production costs at present .
süddeutsche zeitung said the smart division would run up a loss this year of more than € 400 million -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- .

the announcement triggered a slide in pub group and tobacco shares . under the terms of the new ruling , all government departments will become smoke-free zones , as will all enclosed public places , restaurants and pubs and bars preparing and serving food .
the white paper , which also targeted the increase in obesity in the uk and sexually transmitted diseases , stipulated that pubs , bars and private clubs not serving food would be free make their own rules on smoking . elements of the ban are due to come into effect from 2006 , with the full embargo in place by the end of 2008 . " we believe that , in a free society , men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle , even when it may damage their own health , " health secretary john reid told members of parliament .
" but people do not have the right to damage the health of others .
we therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments . " back in time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a limited pleasure for britain 's smokers the british beer and pub association said the ruling could put bars off serving food and drive them back in time to the days when pubs were nothing more than drinking dens , as ultimately the greatest profit comes from alcohol . all eu members except germany have either adopted or have in the pipeline measures to limit tobacco use in public places .
most rules concern public places , the workplace , tobacco advertising , or the sale of cigarettes to minors . few european countries , however , have yet gone as far as ireland which imposed a complete ban back in march .
earlier this month scotland , where health policy is set by an autonomous legislature , also unveiled plans to make smokers stub out in public , and wales is considering a similar move . sweden is also expected to tighten its anti-tobacco legislation in 2005 , and although not a member of the eu norway also banned tobacco in public places on june 1 .
as for the rest of the continent , the regulations vary .
in france , smokers can puff in specially designated areas , whilst in germany it is up to the owner or manager of a given venue to decide on the smoking rules .
and although strictly speaking , german restaurant and bar owners should provide their customers with a non-smoking area , the trend is slow in taking off . protecting minors selling cigarettes to minors under 16 is forbidden in austria , german , spain , the netherlands , britain , france and the baltic countries .
in sweden , portugal , finland and poland tobacco can not be sold to under 18s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's a will ...
however , the widespread use of coin-operated cigarette machines , especially in spain , germany , portugal and british pubs , help undermine those rules .
in italy , cigarette machines are only allowed to operate between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. to limit access to underage smokers . a danish law against selling cigarettes to children under 16 went into force on july 1 , and belgium will have one from dec .
1 .
greece is considering similar measures .
in an effort to make it more difficult for young people to get hold of cigarettes , germany 's parliament on may 6 voted to prohibit the sale of packs containing fewer than 17 cigarettes . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

" back in time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a limited pleasure for britain 's smokers the british beer and pub association said the ruling could put bars off serving food and drive them back in time to the days when pubs were nothing more than drinking dens , as ultimately the greatest profit comes from alcohol . all eu members except germany have either adopted or have in the pipeline measures to limit tobacco use in public places .
most rules concern public places , the workplace , tobacco advertising , or the sale of cigarettes to minors . few european countries , however , have yet gone as far as ireland which imposed a complete ban back in march .
earlier this month scotland , where health policy is set by an autonomous legislature , also unveiled plans to make smokers stub out in public , and wales is considering a similar move . sweden is also expected to tighten its anti-tobacco legislation in 2005 , and although not a member of the eu norway also banned tobacco in public places on june 1 .
as for the rest of the continent , the regulations vary .
in france , smokers can puff in specially designated areas , whilst in germany it is up to the owner or manager of a given venue to decide on the smoking rules .

in sweden , portugal , finland and poland tobacco can not be sold to under 18s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's a will ...
however , the widespread use of coin-operated cigarette machines , especially in spain , germany , portugal and british pubs , help undermine those rules .
in italy , cigarette machines are only allowed to operate between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. to limit access to underage smokers . a danish law against selling cigarettes to children under 16 went into force on july 1 , and belgium will have one from dec .
1 .
greece is considering similar measures .
in an effort to make it more difficult for young people to get hold of cigarettes , germany 's parliament on may 6 voted to prohibit the sale of packs containing fewer than 17 cigarettes . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

diplomats said they would continue to engage with cuba 's opposition but were looking to do so in a more productive way , leaving the path open for talks with government officials .
a largely symbolic move to invite dissidents to national festivities at eu embassies has seen cuba restrict european diplomats ' access to top cuban officials .
the eu stepped up contacts with the opposition figures in june 2003 following the summary execution of three men who attempted to hijack a boat to the us - ending cuba 's de facto moratorium on the death penalty .
the matter is now likely to be dealt with at foreign minister level .
" their -lsb- the cuban government 's -rsb- logic is that this puts government officials at the same level as the opposition ... they find this unacceptable , " joaquín roy , director of the centre for eu studies at the university of miami told the euobserver .
since spain 's left of center government took power in march this year , madrid has been most active in lobbying to revise the eu 's common position .
with fidel castro now thought to be 78 , focus is now on how to help ensure cuba receives a " soft landing " - as some commentators have put it .
" when the transition happens -lsb- eu -rsb- member states , and in particular spain , would like to be in a better position , rather than in a vacuum where they have no presence , " roy said .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .

under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .

pfahls , who served in the german government from 1989 to 1992 , is suspected of taking nearly € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia and failing to declare the earnings .
the german public prosecutor 's office had appealed to the french court to approve extradition , but pfahls had refused and a hearing was ordered for october , at which time the 61-year-old 's lawyer , david frerejacque , argued that the case against his client had expired .
if the german again refuses extradition to germany after wednesday 's ruling by the appeals court , he will be held in french prison until a final court decision is made .
according to french and german law , for an extradition to go through , a crime must be punishable in both countries . dw-world.de government calls for swift extradition of fallen politician holger pfahls is considered a key figure in the political slush fund scandals of the christian democrats in the 1990s .
following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc eu to revise ties with cuban opposition representatives from the eu-25 on tuesday agreed to look into ways of making contacts with dissidents and civil society " more effective , " according to the dutch presidency .
diplomats said they would continue to engage with cuba 's opposition but were looking to do so in a more productive way , leaving the path open for talks with government officials .
a largely symbolic move to invite dissidents to national festivities at eu embassies has seen cuba restrict european diplomats ' access to top cuban officials .
the eu stepped up contacts with the opposition figures in june 2003 following the summary execution of three men who attempted to hijack a boat to the us - ending cuba 's de facto moratorium on the death penalty .
the matter is now likely to be dealt with at foreign minister level .
" their -lsb- the cuban government 's -rsb- logic is that this puts government officials at the same level as the opposition ... they find this unacceptable , " joaquín roy , director of the centre for eu studies at the university of miami told the euobserver .
since spain 's left of center government took power in march this year , madrid has been most active in lobbying to revise the eu 's common position .
with fidel castro now thought to be 78 , focus is now on how to help ensure cuba receives a " soft landing " - as some commentators have put it .
" when the transition happens -lsb- eu -rsb- member states , and in particular spain , would like to be in a better position , rather than in a vacuum where they have no presence , " roy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking sweden bans smoking smoking ban begins in italy banning smoke at work in europe current affairs -pipe- 17.11.2004 britain to impose sweeping smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stubbing out seems to be the new trend among eu countries the british government has revealed plans to ban smokers from lighting up in public places and workplaces across the country .
the announcement triggered a slide in pub group and tobacco shares . under the terms of the new ruling , all government departments will become smoke-free zones , as will all enclosed public places , restaurants and pubs and bars preparing and serving food .
the white paper , which also targeted the increase in obesity in the uk and sexually transmitted diseases , stipulated that pubs , bars and private clubs not serving food would be free make their own rules on smoking . elements of the ban are due to come into effect from 2006 , with the full embargo in place by the end of 2008 . " we believe that , in a free society , men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle , even when it may damage their own health , " health secretary john reid told members of parliament .
" but people do not have the right to damage the health of others .
we therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments . " back in time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a limited pleasure for britain 's smokers the british beer and pub association said the ruling could put bars off serving food and drive them back in time to the days when pubs were nothing more than drinking dens , as ultimately the greatest profit comes from alcohol . all eu members except germany have either adopted or have in the pipeline measures to limit tobacco use in public places .
most rules concern public places , the workplace , tobacco advertising , or the sale of cigarettes to minors . few european countries , however , have yet gone as far as ireland which imposed a complete ban back in march .
earlier this month scotland , where health policy is set by an autonomous legislature , also unveiled plans to make smokers stub out in public , and wales is considering a similar move . sweden is also expected to tighten its anti-tobacco legislation in 2005 , and although not a member of the eu norway also banned tobacco in public places on june 1 .
as for the rest of the continent , the regulations vary .
in france , smokers can puff in specially designated areas , whilst in germany it is up to the owner or manager of a given venue to decide on the smoking rules .
and although strictly speaking , german restaurant and bar owners should provide their customers with a non-smoking area , the trend is slow in taking off . protecting minors selling cigarettes to minors under 16 is forbidden in austria , german , spain , the netherlands , britain , france and the baltic countries .
in sweden , portugal , finland and poland tobacco can not be sold to under 18s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's a will ...
however , the widespread use of coin-operated cigarette machines , especially in spain , germany , portugal and british pubs , help undermine those rules .
in italy , cigarette machines are only allowed to operate between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. to limit access to underage smokers . a danish law against selling cigarettes to children under 16 went into force on july 1 , and belgium will have one from dec .
1 .
greece is considering similar measures .
in an effort to make it more difficult for young people to get hold of cigarettes , germany 's parliament on may 6 voted to prohibit the sale of packs containing fewer than 17 cigarettes . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use .

according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking sweden bans smoking smoking ban begins in italy banning smoke at work in europe current affairs -pipe- 17.11.2004 britain to impose sweeping smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stubbing out seems to be the new trend among eu countries the british government has revealed plans to ban smokers from lighting up in public places and workplaces across the country .
the announcement triggered a slide in pub group and tobacco shares . under the terms of the new ruling , all government departments will become smoke-free zones , as will all enclosed public places , restaurants and pubs and bars preparing and serving food .
the white paper , which also targeted the increase in obesity in the uk and sexually transmitted diseases , stipulated that pubs , bars and private clubs not serving food would be free make their own rules on smoking . elements of the ban are due to come into effect from 2006 , with the full embargo in place by the end of 2008 . " we believe that , in a free society , men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle , even when it may damage their own health , " health secretary john reid told members of parliament .
" but people do not have the right to damage the health of others .
we therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments . " back in time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a limited pleasure for britain 's smokers the british beer and pub association said the ruling could put bars off serving food and drive them back in time to the days when pubs were nothing more than drinking dens , as ultimately the greatest profit comes from alcohol . all eu members except germany have either adopted or have in the pipeline measures to limit tobacco use in public places .
most rules concern public places , the workplace , tobacco advertising , or the sale of cigarettes to minors . few european countries , however , have yet gone as far as ireland which imposed a complete ban back in march .
earlier this month scotland , where health policy is set by an autonomous legislature , also unveiled plans to make smokers stub out in public , and wales is considering a similar move . sweden is also expected to tighten its anti-tobacco legislation in 2005 , and although not a member of the eu norway also banned tobacco in public places on june 1 .
as for the rest of the continent , the regulations vary .
in france , smokers can puff in specially designated areas , whilst in germany it is up to the owner or manager of a given venue to decide on the smoking rules .
and although strictly speaking , german restaurant and bar owners should provide their customers with a non-smoking area , the trend is slow in taking off . protecting minors selling cigarettes to minors under 16 is forbidden in austria , german , spain , the netherlands , britain , france and the baltic countries .
in sweden , portugal , finland and poland tobacco can not be sold to under 18s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's a will ...
however , the widespread use of coin-operated cigarette machines , especially in spain , germany , portugal and british pubs , help undermine those rules .
in italy , cigarette machines are only allowed to operate between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. to limit access to underage smokers . a danish law against selling cigarettes to children under 16 went into force on july 1 , and belgium will have one from dec .
1 .
greece is considering similar measures .
in an effort to make it more difficult for young people to get hold of cigarettes , germany 's parliament on may 6 voted to prohibit the sale of packs containing fewer than 17 cigarettes . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .

the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking sweden bans smoking smoking ban begins in italy banning smoke at work in europe current affairs -pipe- 17.11.2004 britain to impose sweeping smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stubbing out seems to be the new trend among eu countries the british government has revealed plans to ban smokers from lighting up in public places and workplaces across the country .
the announcement triggered a slide in pub group and tobacco shares . under the terms of the new ruling , all government departments will become smoke-free zones , as will all enclosed public places , restaurants and pubs and bars preparing and serving food .
the white paper , which also targeted the increase in obesity in the uk and sexually transmitted diseases , stipulated that pubs , bars and private clubs not serving food would be free make their own rules on smoking . elements of the ban are due to come into effect from 2006 , with the full embargo in place by the end of 2008 . " we believe that , in a free society , men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle , even when it may damage their own health , " health secretary john reid told members of parliament .
" but people do not have the right to damage the health of others .
we therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments . " back in time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a limited pleasure for britain 's smokers the british beer and pub association said the ruling could put bars off serving food and drive them back in time to the days when pubs were nothing more than drinking dens , as ultimately the greatest profit comes from alcohol . all eu members except germany have either adopted or have in the pipeline measures to limit tobacco use in public places .
most rules concern public places , the workplace , tobacco advertising , or the sale of cigarettes to minors . few european countries , however , have yet gone as far as ireland which imposed a complete ban back in march .
earlier this month scotland , where health policy is set by an autonomous legislature , also unveiled plans to make smokers stub out in public , and wales is considering a similar move . sweden is also expected to tighten its anti-tobacco legislation in 2005 , and although not a member of the eu norway also banned tobacco in public places on june 1 .
as for the rest of the continent , the regulations vary .
in france , smokers can puff in specially designated areas , whilst in germany it is up to the owner or manager of a given venue to decide on the smoking rules .
and although strictly speaking , german restaurant and bar owners should provide their customers with a non-smoking area , the trend is slow in taking off . protecting minors selling cigarettes to minors under 16 is forbidden in austria , german , spain , the netherlands , britain , france and the baltic countries .
in sweden , portugal , finland and poland tobacco can not be sold to under 18s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's a will ...
however , the widespread use of coin-operated cigarette machines , especially in spain , germany , portugal and british pubs , help undermine those rules .
in italy , cigarette machines are only allowed to operate between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. to limit access to underage smokers . a danish law against selling cigarettes to children under 16 went into force on july 1 , and belgium will have one from dec .
1 .
greece is considering similar measures .
in an effort to make it more difficult for young people to get hold of cigarettes , germany 's parliament on may 6 voted to prohibit the sale of packs containing fewer than 17 cigarettes . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler hopes to turn around its loss-making smart unit by establishing a close partnership between the ultra-small car and french car maker peugeot , the süddeutsche zeitung reported on wednesday .
the newspaper quoted sources close to daimlerchrysler as saying the car maker hoped to work together with peugeot to develop two- and four-seater small cars .
however , a spokesman for smart dismissed the report as " completely false " and " totally unfounded . "
süddeutsche zeitung also said that daimlerchrysler would , in the mid-term , end its cooperation with japanese maker mitsubishi motors -lrb- mmc -rrb- which builds the four-seater smart in the netherlands and the mitsubishi colt .
but that information was also wrong , the smart spokesman said .
" our joint projects are doing very well .
there wo n't be any separation from mmc , " he said .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was looking for a partner for the smart car because unit sales are not sufficient to achieve favorable production costs at present .
süddeutsche zeitung said the smart division would run up a loss this year of more than € 400 million -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- .

reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .

" france has had very proper relations with her .
if she is appointed we will continue to have the same relations , " barnier told europe 1 radio , adding that " the moment has come to rebuild , to renew , the transatlantic relation in a balanced manner . " french analysts acknowledged that her arrival at the state department would not herald policies more palatable to paris , but cautioned that it would be premature to write her appointment off straightaway as bad news . according to pascal boniface of the institute of international and strategic relations , rice is likely to have " less personal initiative " than powell because of her ideological closeness to president george w. bush .
" it is as if bush was taking personal control of the state department , " he said . boniface said that rice 's famous threat to " punish " france for leading european opposition to washington 's war plans had come to little .
" france is not isolated in its relationship with the us , and can count on germany , spain and belgium , " he said . what about rumsfeld ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld andre kaspi , an expert on the united states at the french national center for scientific research , said rice 's appointment would signal " a desire for change with greater coordination - because -lrb- defense secretary donald -rrb- rumsfeld and powell did not get on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 working more to keep germany 's holidays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the magic formula in the holiday debate the raging debate in germany over public holidays in recent weeks recalled similar dispute almost a decade ago .
the difference ?
germans are serious about working more . in 1995 , the conservative government of helmut kohl , looking for ways to finance a revolutionary nursing care insurance package , urged states to cut the day of prayer and repentance , a religious holiday celebrated across the country . the debate at the time was fierce , but the resistance of church officials in all but one of germany 's 16 states proved futile for the holiday that would have been on wednesday .
nine years later , a similar discussion erupted over the proposal from chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to move germany 's national unity day , celebrated on oct .
3 , to a sunday . unlike 1995 , the proposal this time failed , but it has sparked a discussion on working more that would have been unthinkable a decade ago . holiday cuts do n't spark economy no european country has more national and religious holidays than germany , where states decide what holidays to observe .
all 16 states have at least nine holidays , with the number in religious bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg , the country 's most dynamic economies , climbing up to 14 in some places . proponents of cutting a holiday , which included finance minister hans eichel and schröder , argued that eliminating the holiday would allow for one more work day and that would bring in roughly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . though the figure sounds impressive , most economists said it only holds if the economy is doing well - which is definitely not the case at the moment in germany . " how do more working hours help a company that does n't have enough commissions ? "
holger schäfer , a labor market expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in cologne told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers in the rüsselsheim factory schäfer argued for a bit more flexibility in the collective bargaining agreement between industry and labor as a way of increasing productivity when it is direly needed .
taking away a holiday , he said , did not . " when you 're talking about 220 potential working days a year , one day less is not that much , " he said . facing a new economic reality but the discussion in recent weeks has nevertheless had an effect : both employers and their workers are realizing that the new economic reality requires massive changes .
already , there is talk of forcing employees who take cigarette breaks to work extra to make up for lost time , and the introduction of longer work weeks seems unavoidable , say analysts .
" i think people would prefer to leave holidays and vacation days alone and instead work longer hours , " michael schröder , an economist at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- in mannheim , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag in front of the reichstag in berlin all agree that the country 's political leaders are not likely to put additional holidays on the chopping block any time soon .
" i think they 've come to the realization that that 's not the best way to consolidate the budget , " said schäfer . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin ditches plans to move unity day chancellor gerhard schröder has abandoned plans to abolish german unity day on the grounds the proposal lacked political support .

germans are serious about working more . in 1995 , the conservative government of helmut kohl , looking for ways to finance a revolutionary nursing care insurance package , urged states to cut the day of prayer and repentance , a religious holiday celebrated across the country . the debate at the time was fierce , but the resistance of church officials in all but one of germany 's 16 states proved futile for the holiday that would have been on wednesday .
nine years later , a similar discussion erupted over the proposal from chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to move germany 's national unity day , celebrated on oct .
3 , to a sunday . unlike 1995 , the proposal this time failed , but it has sparked a discussion on working more that would have been unthinkable a decade ago . holiday cuts do n't spark economy no european country has more national and religious holidays than germany , where states decide what holidays to observe .
all 16 states have at least nine holidays , with the number in religious bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg , the country 's most dynamic economies , climbing up to 14 in some places . proponents of cutting a holiday , which included finance minister hans eichel and schröder , argued that eliminating the holiday would allow for one more work day and that would bring in roughly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . though the figure sounds impressive , most economists said it only holds if the economy is doing well - which is definitely not the case at the moment in germany .

taking away a holiday , he said , did not . " when you 're talking about 220 potential working days a year , one day less is not that much , " he said . facing a new economic reality but the discussion in recent weeks has nevertheless had an effect : both employers and their workers are realizing that the new economic reality requires massive changes .
already , there is talk of forcing employees who take cigarette breaks to work extra to make up for lost time , and the introduction of longer work weeks seems unavoidable , say analysts .

" with an incomplete memory , we risk seeing a day when what existed here before 1989 will be repeated , " warned jan hron , a student leader from prague 's charles university .
" we undoubtedly live in a standard democracy today , but interest in public affairs is fading in favor of the private sphere . " above all , hron and his friends want to ensure that the demonstrations of their predecessors are not forgotten .
thanks to their initiative , the citizens of prague can on wednesday listen to speeches from leaders of the velvet revolution , and then retrace the exact route taken by student demonstrators on nov .
17 , 1989 . brutally suppressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was brutally suppressed by police and a special unit of " red beret " communists in narodni -lrb- national -rrb- street in the center of the capital .
the repression gave way to a wave of protests by czechs and slovaks , which sounded the death knell for totalitarianism . some six weeks later , prague 's communists , who were among the least open to reform throughout the soviet bloc , ceded power without any resistance .
on dec .
29 , the dissident vaclav havel , who had been imprisoned just a few months earlier , was elected president of czechoslovakia . unlike other post-communist countries that joined the european union in may , the czech communist party kscm would change neither its name nor its ideology .
it is currently the second most popular party in the country , largely due to nostalgia among older citizens .
according to a poll published last week , one in five czechs wants to return to the communist system . wednesday 's demonstrations are part of a project dubbed " autumn without communists , " involving many artists , particularly musicians , who have already staged several anti-communist concerts in recent weeks . " i am happy that today there are people who reject a little the idea that the communists could be a normal part of society , " said organizer petr placak .
a former dissident , placak is fiercely opposed to the kscm , which he would like to see banned . critical of nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a group that denies the system and violates laws should be excluded from the democratic competition .
no one could of course have something against the existence of a left-wing party , even one with a communist tendency , but it can not follow the doctrine of stalin and lenin , " he said . placak is also very strongly critical of nostalgia for the communist regime .
he said he grew up during the 1980s , and that people had forgotten how bad things were back then .
he listed the omnipresent political oppression at work and at home , as well as everyday woes such as difficulties buying things you needed . " i am afraid that many young people today know absolutely nothing about it .
at school , history lessons often stop at 1945 or sometimes at world war i. one of the biggest mistakes after 1989 was that we did not explain very well to the young generation what it was about then , " placak said . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .

if she is appointed we will continue to have the same relations , " barnier told europe 1 radio , adding that " the moment has come to rebuild , to renew , the transatlantic relation in a balanced manner . " french analysts acknowledged that her arrival at the state department would not herald policies more palatable to paris , but cautioned that it would be premature to write her appointment off straightaway as bad news . according to pascal boniface of the institute of international and strategic relations , rice is likely to have " less personal initiative " than powell because of her ideological closeness to president george w. bush .
" it is as if bush was taking personal control of the state department , " he said . boniface said that rice 's famous threat to " punish " france for leading european opposition to washington 's war plans had come to little .
" france is not isolated in its relationship with the us , and can count on germany , spain and belgium , " he said . what about rumsfeld ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld andre kaspi , an expert on the united states at the french national center for scientific research , said rice 's appointment would signal " a desire for change with greater coordination - because -lrb- defense secretary donald -rrb- rumsfeld and powell did not get on together . " " we must wait a while before concluding that she is an enemy , " he said , recalling that it was rice who " initiated bush to international realities .

" the reality on the ground could well take precedence over ideology and encourage rice to be more open than rumsfeld , " he said . some analysts said the real direction of the new administration will become clearer only when bush completes his team with new appointments . " the real question is whether rumsfeld stays at defense and who takes over from rice at national security .

reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .
she is a fluent russian speaker and an expert on arms control .
amid strong european opposition to the war in iraq , rice allegedly said that the us should forgive russia , forget germany and punish france . france remains diplomatic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel barnier , right , the french foreign minister , and joschka fischer , his german counterpart french foreign minister michel barnier took a studiously diplomatic line towards the united states ' future top diplomat .
" france has had very proper relations with her .
if she is appointed we will continue to have the same relations , " barnier told europe 1 radio , adding that " the moment has come to rebuild , to renew , the transatlantic relation in a balanced manner . " french analysts acknowledged that her arrival at the state department would not herald policies more palatable to paris , but cautioned that it would be premature to write her appointment off straightaway as bad news . according to pascal boniface of the institute of international and strategic relations , rice is likely to have " less personal initiative " than powell because of her ideological closeness to president george w. bush .
" it is as if bush was taking personal control of the state department , " he said . boniface said that rice 's famous threat to " punish " france for leading european opposition to washington 's war plans had come to little .
" france is not isolated in its relationship with the us , and can count on germany , spain and belgium , " he said . what about rumsfeld ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld andre kaspi , an expert on the united states at the french national center for scientific research , said rice 's appointment would signal " a desire for change with greater coordination - because -lrb- defense secretary donald -rrb- rumsfeld and powell did not get on together . " " we must wait a while before concluding that she is an enemy , " he said , recalling that it was rice who " initiated bush to international realities . " according to boniface , though her nomination may lead to a radicalization of us policy , developments on the ground in iraq may well force a softer approach . " the reality on the ground could well take precedence over ideology and encourage rice to be more open than rumsfeld , " he said . some analysts said the real direction of the new administration will become clearer only when bush completes his team with new appointments . " the real question is whether rumsfeld stays at defense and who takes over from rice at national security .
if -lrb- deputy defense secretary -rrb- paul wolfowitz replaces rice , that will be bad news , " said guillaume parmentier , of the french institute for international relations . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to replace powell us secretary of state colin powell , who battled with bush administration hawks over the iraq war , has stepped down and senior officials said national security advisor condoleezza rice would take his place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .

the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .

for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .

reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .

reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 the future looks broadband großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband is picking up as more applications demand higher speeds broadband internet access is growing by leaps and bounds in germany , according to a new study .
however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if a new product is introduced through multimedia channels or partner firms work together online in developing a project , fast internet connections are needed .
but newer applications , such as fast developing internet telephony and mobile broadband applications , are bringing the need for broadband to the everyday users and could give the sector another important boost . ralf jäckel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online advertising gathers momentum at the german multi-media congress , experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use .

" the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .

" german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if a new product is introduced through multimedia channels or partner firms work together online in developing a project , fast internet connections are needed .
but newer applications , such as fast developing internet telephony and mobile broadband applications , are bringing the need for broadband to the everyday users and could give the sector another important boost . ralf jäckel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online advertising gathers momentum at the german multi-media congress , experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn .

" with an incomplete memory , we risk seeing a day when what existed here before 1989 will be repeated , " warned jan hron , a student leader from prague 's charles university .
" we undoubtedly live in a standard democracy today , but interest in public affairs is fading in favor of the private sphere . " above all , hron and his friends want to ensure that the demonstrations of their predecessors are not forgotten .
thanks to their initiative , the citizens of prague can on wednesday listen to speeches from leaders of the velvet revolution , and then retrace the exact route taken by student demonstrators on nov .
17 , 1989 . brutally suppressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was brutally suppressed by police and a special unit of " red beret " communists in narodni -lrb- national -rrb- street in the center of the capital .
the repression gave way to a wave of protests by czechs and slovaks , which sounded the death knell for totalitarianism . some six weeks later , prague 's communists , who were among the least open to reform throughout the soviet bloc , ceded power without any resistance .
on dec .
29 , the dissident vaclav havel , who had been imprisoned just a few months earlier , was elected president of czechoslovakia . unlike other post-communist countries that joined the european union in may , the czech communist party kscm would change neither its name nor its ideology .
it is currently the second most popular party in the country , largely due to nostalgia among older citizens .
according to a poll published last week , one in five czechs wants to return to the communist system . wednesday 's demonstrations are part of a project dubbed " autumn without communists , " involving many artists , particularly musicians , who have already staged several anti-communist concerts in recent weeks . " i am happy that today there are people who reject a little the idea that the communists could be a normal part of society , " said organizer petr placak .
a former dissident , placak is fiercely opposed to the kscm , which he would like to see banned . critical of nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a group that denies the system and violates laws should be excluded from the democratic competition .
no one could of course have something against the existence of a left-wing party , even one with a communist tendency , but it can not follow the doctrine of stalin and lenin , " he said . placak is also very strongly critical of nostalgia for the communist regime .
he said he grew up during the 1980s , and that people had forgotten how bad things were back then .
he listed the omnipresent political oppression at work and at home , as well as everyday woes such as difficulties buying things you needed . " i am afraid that many young people today know absolutely nothing about it .
at school , history lessons often stop at 1945 or sometimes at world war i. one of the biggest mistakes after 1989 was that we did not explain very well to the young generation what it was about then , " placak said . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 the future looks broadband großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband is picking up as more applications demand higher speeds broadband internet access is growing by leaps and bounds in germany , according to a new study .
however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .

the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if a new product is introduced through multimedia channels or partner firms work together online in developing a project , fast internet connections are needed .
but newer applications , such as fast developing internet telephony and mobile broadband applications , are bringing the need for broadband to the everyday users and could give the sector another important boost . ralf jäckel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online advertising gathers momentum at the german multi-media congress , experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn .

" with an incomplete memory , we risk seeing a day when what existed here before 1989 will be repeated , " warned jan hron , a student leader from prague 's charles university .
" we undoubtedly live in a standard democracy today , but interest in public affairs is fading in favor of the private sphere . " above all , hron and his friends want to ensure that the demonstrations of their predecessors are not forgotten .
thanks to their initiative , the citizens of prague can on wednesday listen to speeches from leaders of the velvet revolution , and then retrace the exact route taken by student demonstrators on nov .
17 , 1989 . brutally suppressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march was brutally suppressed by police and a special unit of " red beret " communists in narodni -lrb- national -rrb- street in the center of the capital .
the repression gave way to a wave of protests by czechs and slovaks , which sounded the death knell for totalitarianism . some six weeks later , prague 's communists , who were among the least open to reform throughout the soviet bloc , ceded power without any resistance .
on dec .
29 , the dissident vaclav havel , who had been imprisoned just a few months earlier , was elected president of czechoslovakia . unlike other post-communist countries that joined the european union in may , the czech communist party kscm would change neither its name nor its ideology .
it is currently the second most popular party in the country , largely due to nostalgia among older citizens .
according to a poll published last week , one in five czechs wants to return to the communist system . wednesday 's demonstrations are part of a project dubbed " autumn without communists , " involving many artists , particularly musicians , who have already staged several anti-communist concerts in recent weeks . " i am happy that today there are people who reject a little the idea that the communists could be a normal part of society , " said organizer petr placak .
a former dissident , placak is fiercely opposed to the kscm , which he would like to see banned . critical of nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a group that denies the system and violates laws should be excluded from the democratic competition .
no one could of course have something against the existence of a left-wing party , even one with a communist tendency , but it can not follow the doctrine of stalin and lenin , " he said . placak is also very strongly critical of nostalgia for the communist regime .
he said he grew up during the 1980s , and that people had forgotten how bad things were back then .
he listed the omnipresent political oppression at work and at home , as well as everyday woes such as difficulties buying things you needed . " i am afraid that many young people today know absolutely nothing about it .
at school , history lessons often stop at 1945 or sometimes at world war i. one of the biggest mistakes after 1989 was that we did not explain very well to the young generation what it was about then , " placak said . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .

the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .

the world toilet organization has made it its business to tackle the issue of inadequate sanitation in developing countries , where people often have to resort to using the street to do their thing . toilet training and after years of rough hygiene , when they do suddenly have access to proper toilets , they often have to be trained in the practice of using them .
the german development aid charity gtz even organizes toilet workshops and broadcasts radio programs and publishes comics in an attempt to flush out the old , less hygienic habits . a key consideration in schooling the unknowing is toilet design , as the throne-like lavatory which so captured the imagination of regal europeans is a foreign concept in many parts of the world , where people prefer to get closer to the ground than the prudish porcelain pot will ever allow . in more developed countries , toilet trends are streaming forth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

" with an incomplete memory , we risk seeing a day when what existed here before 1989 will be repeated , " warned jan hron , a student leader from prague 's charles university .
" we undoubtedly live in a standard democracy today , but interest in public affairs is fading in favor of the private sphere . " above all , hron and his friends want to ensure that the demonstrations of their predecessors are not forgotten .

the repression gave way to a wave of protests by czechs and slovaks , which sounded the death knell for totalitarianism . some six weeks later , prague 's communists , who were among the least open to reform throughout the soviet bloc , ceded power without any resistance .
on dec .
29 , the dissident vaclav havel , who had been imprisoned just a few months earlier , was elected president of czechoslovakia . unlike other post-communist countries that joined the european union in may , the czech communist party kscm would change neither its name nor its ideology .
it is currently the second most popular party in the country , largely due to nostalgia among older citizens .
according to a poll published last week , one in five czechs wants to return to the communist system . wednesday 's demonstrations are part of a project dubbed " autumn without communists , " involving many artists , particularly musicians , who have already staged several anti-communist concerts in recent weeks . " i am happy that today there are people who reject a little the idea that the communists could be a normal part of society , " said organizer petr placak .
a former dissident , placak is fiercely opposed to the kscm , which he would like to see banned . critical of nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a group that denies the system and violates laws should be excluded from the democratic competition .
no one could of course have something against the existence of a left-wing party , even one with a communist tendency , but it can not follow the doctrine of stalin and lenin , " he said . placak is also very strongly critical of nostalgia for the communist regime .
he said he grew up during the 1980s , and that people had forgotten how bad things were back then .
he listed the omnipresent political oppression at work and at home , as well as everyday woes such as difficulties buying things you needed . " i am afraid that many young people today know absolutely nothing about it .
at school , history lessons often stop at 1945 or sometimes at world war i. one of the biggest mistakes after 1989 was that we did not explain very well to the young generation what it was about then , " placak said . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if a new product is introduced through multimedia channels or partner firms work together online in developing a project , fast internet connections are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .

the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .

under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

yet as the 4th world toilet day in beijing this week demonstrates , finding the perfect spot for that moment of quiet relief is not always easy . for those who are shy about coming forward and stating fundamental facts , there is a wonderfully colorful palette of expressions which can be used to dress up , or indeed dress down the response to nature 's most primeval call .
" i 'm going to go and see a man about a dog ; " " i 'm just going to go and spend a penny ; " " where might i powder my nose ? " .
and they are all well and good , except for those occasions when the nose-powdering room turns out to be nothing more than a hand basin and a mirror . it 's a dilemma which could be relieved by a touch of fantasy , but it 's also one which would seem like luxury to a good portion of the world 's population .
the world toilet organization has made it its business to tackle the issue of inadequate sanitation in developing countries , where people often have to resort to using the street to do their thing . toilet training and after years of rough hygiene , when they do suddenly have access to proper toilets , they often have to be trained in the practice of using them .
the german development aid charity gtz even organizes toilet workshops and broadcasts radio programs and publishes comics in an attempt to flush out the old , less hygienic habits . a key consideration in schooling the unknowing is toilet design , as the throne-like lavatory which so captured the imagination of regal europeans is a foreign concept in many parts of the world , where people prefer to get closer to the ground than the prudish porcelain pot will ever allow . in more developed countries , toilet trends are streaming forth .

many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .

" more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .

under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .

under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 germany upbeat , france cautious on rice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of american diplomacy german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .
reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .
she is a fluent russian speaker and an expert on arms control .
amid strong european opposition to the war in iraq , rice allegedly said that the us should forgive russia , forget germany and punish france . france remains diplomatic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel barnier , right , the french foreign minister , and joschka fischer , his german counterpart french foreign minister michel barnier took a studiously diplomatic line towards the united states ' future top diplomat .
" france has had very proper relations with her .
if she is appointed we will continue to have the same relations , " barnier told europe 1 radio , adding that " the moment has come to rebuild , to renew , the transatlantic relation in a balanced manner . " french analysts acknowledged that her arrival at the state department would not herald policies more palatable to paris , but cautioned that it would be premature to write her appointment off straightaway as bad news . according to pascal boniface of the institute of international and strategic relations , rice is likely to have " less personal initiative " than powell because of her ideological closeness to president george w. bush .
" it is as if bush was taking personal control of the state department , " he said . boniface said that rice 's famous threat to " punish " france for leading european opposition to washington 's war plans had come to little .
" france is not isolated in its relationship with the us , and can count on germany , spain and belgium , " he said . what about rumsfeld ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld andre kaspi , an expert on the united states at the french national center for scientific research , said rice 's appointment would signal " a desire for change with greater coordination - because -lrb- defense secretary donald -rrb- rumsfeld and powell did not get on together . " " we must wait a while before concluding that she is an enemy , " he said , recalling that it was rice who " initiated bush to international realities . " according to boniface , though her nomination may lead to a radicalization of us policy , developments on the ground in iraq may well force a softer approach . " the reality on the ground could well take precedence over ideology and encourage rice to be more open than rumsfeld , " he said . some analysts said the real direction of the new administration will become clearer only when bush completes his team with new appointments . " the real question is whether rumsfeld stays at defense and who takes over from rice at national security .
if -lrb- deputy defense secretary -rrb- paul wolfowitz replaces rice , that will be bad news , " said guillaume parmentier , of the french institute for international relations . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to replace powell us secretary of state colin powell , who battled with bush administration hawks over the iraq war , has stepped down and senior officials said national security advisor condoleezza rice would take his place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 the future looks broadband großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband is picking up as more applications demand higher speeds broadband internet access is growing by leaps and bounds in germany , according to a new study .
however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if a new product is introduced through multimedia channels or partner firms work together online in developing a project , fast internet connections are needed .
but newer applications , such as fast developing internet telephony and mobile broadband applications , are bringing the need for broadband to the everyday users and could give the sector another important boost . ralf jäckel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online advertising gathers momentum at the german multi-media congress , experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 germany upbeat , france cautious on rice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of american diplomacy german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .
reaction from officials in france was more cautious . a day after saying he would miss working with retiring us secretary of state colin powell , fischer was upbeat that his relationship with powell 's replacement would be equally warm and effective . " the work with condoleezza rice in her role as national security advisor at the white house was based on trust , was close , and always excellent on a personal level , " fischer , who is on a visit to central america , said .
" i assume this will also be the case in the future . " us president george w. bush on tuesday nominated rice to replace powell .
some in europe have privately expressed regret that powell 's departure could strengthen the role of hardliners in the bush administration who have shown little regard for european sensibilities on issues ranging from the war in iraq to environmental matters such as global warming . france struck a wait-and-see attitude tuesday towards the appointment of rice , who is widely seen as a more hawkish figure than powell .
she is a fluent russian speaker and an expert on arms control .
amid strong european opposition to the war in iraq , rice allegedly said that the us should forgive russia , forget germany and punish france . france remains diplomatic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel barnier , right , the french foreign minister , and joschka fischer , his german counterpart french foreign minister michel barnier took a studiously diplomatic line towards the united states ' future top diplomat .

yet as the 4th world toilet day in beijing this week demonstrates , finding the perfect spot for that moment of quiet relief is not always easy . for those who are shy about coming forward and stating fundamental facts , there is a wonderfully colorful palette of expressions which can be used to dress up , or indeed dress down the response to nature 's most primeval call .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .
german finance minister hans eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 .
however , the " five wise men " predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005 .
in a sign that the government has acknowledged , if not accepted , the cloudy forecast , chancellor gerhard schröder said it " wo n't be easy " to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of gdp next year . afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2004 press review : the world 's ruling couple european editorials on wednesday commented on condoleeza rice becoming the new us secretary of state while others condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by iraqi rebels . condoleezza rice and george w. bush are the world ’ s ruling couple , remarked italy ’ s la stampa – a pair which defines the dynamics of postmodernism .
their political relationship isn ’ t like one between kings and queens , political marriages or even like normal lovers , the paper said .
but they are a couple nonetheless , it added .
rice is probably the closest person to the president , they trust one another and the paper pointed out that she ’ s the only one who can influence him without scaring or irritating him . der bund in bern also said it ’ s a plus that bush always gives ' condi ' his ear .
but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .
the paper did note , however , that rice has remained a realist and knows that a democratic middle east can ’ t happen without peace between israel and the palestinians . berlin ’ s der tagesspiegel looked at the historical aspect of rice ’ s new job .
two black people in a row will hold the position of secretary of state , one of them a woman .
the paper claimed this shows an unexpected tolerance and openness about president bush , but it questioned whether this will bring europe closer .
the paper considered powell pro-european and recalled that his predecessor , madeleine albright was born there but fled to america with her family to avoid nazi persecution .
even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .
her killing also caused the paper to worry about the fate of two french journalists who ’ ve been held hostage for three months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the swiss paper didn ’ t think bush chose rice to replace powell only because the president feels comfortable with her and can count on her loyalty .
the daily added it ’ s also because he now has backing from a majority of americans to continue with his hard-line policies regarding foreign policy .
it predicted that the tone towards the remaining rogue states iran and north korea is sure to get sharper .

even though the paper felt rice has a different agenda , people should at least respect her and hope that maybe she ’ ll live up to the expectation that her biography evokes , it concluded . other european editorial writers condemned the apparent killing of british aid worker margaret hassan by her iraqi captors .
hassan was director of care international 's iraq operations and had lived in iraq for 30 years and had converted to islam .
she was taken captive nearly a month ago in baghdad . britain ’ s the independent said just when people thought the tragedy of post-war iraq could hardly be more shocking , along comes news that margaret hassan has apparently been murdered .
the paper asserted that as a woman who devoted her adult life to helping iraqis , she deserved to enjoy the benefits that a free iraq would have offered .
the daily angrily wrote that it defies belief that human beings can think such a cold-blooded slaying can serve their cause , adding that it will only harden attitudes further . the french daily la republique de centre assessed that her execution shows that rebels are reacting with barbarity to the us-led attacks and martial law .
it said no one knows what kind of insane imagination made these kidnappers decide to kill hassan as a sacrifice - a woman who spent nearly three decades trying to ease the suffering of iraqis .

however , germany is n't leading the pack .
many other countries are more developed in this area . the internet sector is teeming with enthusiasm these days : by 2010 , the number of broadband internet connections is expected to grow to about 17 million .
that 's healthy growth , given that last year only 4.2 million households accessed the internet by way of broadband . those using the faster connections are also expected to spend more time doing their high-speed surfing .
while broadband customers average 40 minutes a day online now , in five years that amount is expected to triple . these growth estimates are the results presented on tuesday of a study on broadband connections carried out by the internet provider t-online and the bertelsmann media group . germany just average despite the rosy expectations for the future , germany is still stuck in midfield in international broadband comparisons .
the country needs to catch up when it comes to the broadband penetration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the internet sector association bitkom , out of 100 german households , only 12 use a broadband connection , compared with 26 in denmark , 26 in the us and 27 in japan . the speed in which broadband connections are spreading in germany is also slower than it is among the country 's neighbors .
while other large european countries had broadband growth rates in the second quarter of 2004 of between 10 and 15 percent , germany trailed with a rate of only one percent .
that could be changing , according to bitkom , thanks to a new advertising campaign to spread the broadband gospel that appears to be working since demand is starting to pick up . limited broadband use broadband could have a greater presence in germany , according to the country 's telecommunications giant deutsche telekom .
some nine of our ten telephone connections are suited for broadband , or dsl , use . " german is doing quite well in terms of infrastructure , the weak points are the actual broadband usage and applications , " said brigitte preissl , an it and telecommunications expert at the german institute for economic research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason for that is the success of broadband 's predecessor , isdn .
according to preissl , many people use the internet primarily for e-mail or other simpler applications , for which isdn speeds are more than sufficient . " the additional benefit that one would get with broadband is therefore somewhat limited , " she said . in countries like south korea or the united states , uses such as online video gaming or the downloading and transfer of images are much more widespread .
for these kinds of applications , a broadband connection is almost a necessity . not much competition another problem in germany is the lack of competition among access providers .
virtually all users are forced to get their broadband connection through the telephone line .
access through cable television lines , although widespread in other countries , is almost non-existent in germany .
additionally , deutsche telekom has a near monopoly on broadband access , with some 90 percent of the market . " more competition between cable and dsl providers would certainly help make broadband more attractive , " preissl said . economic advantages besides making quick downloads and video playback possible for home users , broadband technology also carries benefits for the larger economy .
experts questioned for the current t-online / bertelsmann broadband study expect that broadband access that improve a company 's competitiveness and productivity .
over the next five years , they expect a productivity rise of 13.5 percent . " our investigations have shown that an isdn connection is often sufficient for smaller businesses , " preissl said .
" but larger companies in particular often need the higher transfer capacity and speed that broadband offers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2004 cloudy skies ahead for german growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slow growth casts a shadow over germany 's economic recovery a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . in their widely watched autumn report , the german government 's so-called " five wise men " - independent economic advisors - said they were expecting the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to expand by just 1.4 percent next year , compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year .
those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .
public finances at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark skies over the chancellory in berlin .
the absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for germany 's public finances .
" the state of germany 's public finances remains critical , " the experts wrote , predicting that the german public deficit would breach eu budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year .
under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 , and is expected to do so again this year .

those figures fall far short of the government 's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year .
coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports , the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of germany 's public finances .
high euro , low domestic spending to blame the runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the german economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , the experts said .
" a further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year , " said the report , which was published on wednesday .
the panel of experts , which actually comprises four men and one woman , said that strong export growth this year had " enabled germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation . "
" but the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors , " the experts said .
" while global economic developments remain robust , they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in germany , " they diagnosed .
a modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the " first encouraging sign " for a possible improvement in domestic demand .
" our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy . "
nevertheless , " we 're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy , " the experts said .
the modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005 , the report estimated .

" with an incomplete memory , we risk seeing a day when what existed here before 1989 will be repeated , " warned jan hron , a student leader from prague 's charles university .
" we undoubtedly live in a standard democracy today , but interest in public affairs is fading in favor of the private sphere . " above all , hron and his friends want to ensure that the demonstrations of their predecessors are not forgotten .
thanks to their initiative , the citizens of prague can on wednesday listen to speeches from leaders of the velvet revolution , and then retrace the exact route taken by student demonstrators on nov .

the repression gave way to a wave of protests by czechs and slovaks , which sounded the death knell for totalitarianism . some six weeks later , prague 's communists , who were among the least open to reform throughout the soviet bloc , ceded power without any resistance .
on dec .
29 , the dissident vaclav havel , who had been imprisoned just a few months earlier , was elected president of czechoslovakia . unlike other post-communist countries that joined the european union in may , the czech communist party kscm would change neither its name nor its ideology .
it is currently the second most popular party in the country , largely due to nostalgia among older citizens .
according to a poll published last week , one in five czechs wants to return to the communist system . wednesday 's demonstrations are part of a project dubbed " autumn without communists , " involving many artists , particularly musicians , who have already staged several anti-communist concerts in recent weeks . " i am happy that today there are people who reject a little the idea that the communists could be a normal part of society , " said organizer petr placak .
a former dissident , placak is fiercely opposed to the kscm , which he would like to see banned . critical of nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a group that denies the system and violates laws should be excluded from the democratic competition .
no one could of course have something against the existence of a left-wing party , even one with a communist tendency , but it can not follow the doctrine of stalin and lenin , " he said . placak is also very strongly critical of nostalgia for the communist regime .
he said he grew up during the 1980s , and that people had forgotten how bad things were back then .
he listed the omnipresent political oppression at work and at home , as well as everyday woes such as difficulties buying things you needed . " i am afraid that many young people today know absolutely nothing about it .
at school , history lessons often stop at 1945 or sometimes at world war i. one of the biggest mistakes after 1989 was that we did not explain very well to the young generation what it was about then , " placak said . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

the transport and general worker ' union -lrb- t & g -rrb- organised a meeting to discuss the law which is currently out for public consultation .
industrial relations the union says the reforms undermine rights on redundancy pay , discrimination and protection of pay , as well as terms and conditions if jobs are transferred .
but senator paul routier , who is steering the law through the states , says there is some confusion over the proposals .
he says the law should provide a balanced industrial relations strategy which will avoid costly court cases .

the leading environmental information network says 15,589 species are now known to be in a perilous position .
science has understood for some years that an eighth of all birds and a quarter of all mammals are in jeopardy .
but the latest red list shows a third of amphibians and almost 50 % of turtles and tortoises are on the brink , too .
the iucn , which can call on the expertise of some 10,000 scientists across the globe , believes the threat facing global biodiversity is escalating .
iucn 's disappearing world 15,589 species now known to be threatened with extinction 1.9m species described out of an estimated 5m-plus 844 extinctions recorded by science since ad 1500 current extinction rate may be 100-1,000 times natural rate 129 recorded bird extinctions ; 103 occurred since 1800 threatened animal species up from 5,205 to 7,266 since 1996 it lists the 15,589 species - 7,266 animals and 8,323 plants and lichens - as either critically endangered , endangered or vulnerable .
it is an increase of more than 3,000 .
" the fact that we know more makes the situation look worse , of course , because we can list more and more species in trouble .
but that is n't why the trend is accelerating - it is a real phenomenon , " dr simon stuart , who has authored a global species assessment -lrb- gsa -rrb- to accompany the red list , told bbc news .
the gsa shows trends in biodiversity over four years since the last major analysis was done in 2000 .
it highlights in particular the trouble now facing amphibians and cycads , an ancient group of plants .
" a lot of cycads are valuable in the horticultural trade ; people want to collect them .
many have small distributions anyway , so economic -lsb- exploitation -rsb- and habitat loss is the last straw .
some are down to one individual . "
earth 's oldest seed plants over-exploitation and habitat loss are pressures working against many species - but so is the competition from introduced -lrb- or alien -rrb- animals and plants .
human-induced climate change is thought to be an increasingly significant problem , too .
the gsa includes the first complete assessment of amphibians that was reported in the journal science last month .
these creatures -lrb- which include frogs , toads , salamanders and caecilians , or legless amphibians -rrb- are the most threatened of all vertebrate groups .
they also have more species on the verge of extinction .
in total , 21 % of amphibians are critically endangered or endangered , whereas the proportions for mammals and birds are only 10 % and 5 % respectively .
the red list is only a partial picture of the world 's biodiversity .
iucn 's scale of threat extinct - surveys suggest last known individual has died critically endangered - extreme high risk of extinction endangered - species at very high risk of extinction vulnerable - species at high risk of extinction near threatened - may soon move into above categories least concern - species is widespread and abundant estimates for the total number of species on earth vary wildly ; there may be 10 million , there could be 100 million .
what is certain is the limited number of species catalogued by science - barely two million .
while the status of known vertebrates is relatively well documented -lrb- roughly 40 % assessed -rrb- , poor information exists on the animals and plants that inhabit freshwater and marine habitats , for example .
and science has only just begun to scratch the surface in understanding how many bacterial and fungal species may be out there .
" we can continue to assess and bemoan the loss of the world 's biodiversity or we can act .
we must refocus and rethink the way in which society must respond to this global threat , " said dr achim steiner , the iucn 's director-general .
amphibians : the assessment " while most threats to biodiversity are human-driven , human actions alone can prevent many species from becoming extinct .
" there are many examples of species being brought back from the brink including the southern white rhino and black-footed ferret , and thousands of dedicated people around the world are doing their utmost to reverse the extinction rate . "
dr stuart added : " where we have been able to concentrate conservation focus , we often get very good results .
good things are achievable . "
species such as the corncrake and the european otter have been downlisted because of such efforts .
captive breeding and release programmes make an impact , too .
the mallorcan midwife toad , for example , has been reclassified from critically endangered to vulnerable .
several hundred tadpoles and toads have been re-introduced to the wild thanks to an initiative run by the durrell wildlife conservation trust .
" we 've come a long way - this incredible little toad was once thought extinct , " said quentin bloxam , programme director at durrell wildlife .
" today it 's on the road to survival .
we 're delighted with the reclassification on the red list . "

the leading environmental information network says 15,589 species are now known to be in a perilous position .
science has understood for some years that an eighth of all birds and a quarter of all mammals are in jeopardy .
but the latest red list shows a third of amphibians and almost 50 % of turtles and tortoises are on the brink , too .
the iucn , which can call on the expertise of some 10,000 scientists across the globe , believes the threat facing global biodiversity is escalating .
iucn 's disappearing world 15,589 species now known to be threatened with extinction 1.9m species described out of an estimated 5m-plus 844 extinctions recorded by science since ad 1500 current extinction rate may be 100-1,000 times natural rate 129 recorded bird extinctions ; 103 occurred since 1800 threatened animal species up from 5,205 to 7,266 since 1996 it lists the 15,589 species - 7,266 animals and 8,323 plants and lichens - as either critically endangered , endangered or vulnerable .
it is an increase of more than 3,000 .
" the fact that we know more makes the situation look worse , of course , because we can list more and more species in trouble .
but that is n't why the trend is accelerating - it is a real phenomenon , " dr simon stuart , who has authored a global species assessment -lrb- gsa -rrb- to accompany the red list , told bbc news .
the gsa shows trends in biodiversity over four years since the last major analysis was done in 2000 .
it highlights in particular the trouble now facing amphibians and cycads , an ancient group of plants .
" a lot of cycads are valuable in the horticultural trade ; people want to collect them .
many have small distributions anyway , so economic -lsb- exploitation -rsb- and habitat loss is the last straw .
some are down to one individual . "
earth 's oldest seed plants cycads in sharp decline over-exploitation and habitat loss are pressures working against many species - but so is the competition from introduced -lrb- or alien -rrb- animals and plants .
human-induced climate change is thought to be an increasingly significant problem , too .
the gsa includes the first complete assessment of amphibians that was reported in the journal science last month .
these creatures -lrb- which include frogs , toads , salamanders and caecilians , or legless amphibians -rrb- are the most threatened of all vertebrate groups .
they also have more species on the verge of extinction .
in total , 21 % of amphibians are critically endangered or endangered , whereas the proportions for mammals and birds are only 10 % and 5 % respectively .
the red list is only a partial picture of the world 's biodiversity .
iucn 's scale of threat extinct - surveys suggest last known individual has died critically endangered - extreme high risk of extinction endangered - species at very high risk of extinction vulnerable - species at high risk of extinction near threatened - may soon move into above categories least concern - species is widespread and abundant estimates for the total number of species on earth vary wildly ; there may be 10 million , there could be 100 million .
what is certain is the limited number of species catalogued by science - barely two million .
while the status of known vertebrates is relatively well documented -lrb- roughly 40 % assessed -rrb- , poor information exists on the animals and plants that inhabit freshwater and marine habitats , for example .
and science has only just begun to scratch the surface in understanding how many bacterial and fungal species may be out there .
" we can continue to assess and bemoan the loss of the world 's biodiversity or we can act .
we must refocus and rethink the way in which society must respond to this global threat , " said dr achim steiner , the iucn 's director-general .
amphibians : the assessment global amphibians in deep trouble " while most threats to biodiversity are human-driven , human actions alone can prevent many species from becoming extinct .
" there are many examples of species being brought back from the brink including the southern white rhino and black-footed ferret , and thousands of dedicated people around the world are doing their utmost to reverse the extinction rate . "
dr stuart added : " where we have been able to concentrate conservation focus , we often get very good results .
good things are achievable . "
species such as the corncrake and the european otter have been downlisted because of such efforts .

the need to register to vote every year was brought in by the electoral fraud act 2002 .
in the past , one form was given to every household but now everyone has to register individually .
while it is not compulsory to vote , it is a legal requirement for everyone in the province aged 16 and over to be included on the electoral register .
the electoral office has been specifically targeting young people this year as , statistically , they do not register to vote .
it has made registration forms available in a number of locations including schools , colleges , youth clubs , community centres and council offices .
anyone not on the register will not be able to vote in next year 's local government election in may .
the new register will be published on 1 december .

huntingdonshire district council has decided to close seven of its public conveniences - which cost 10p a go - in an attempt to save public money .
a council spokeswoman said because people do not use them the cost of keeping the toilets open is the equivalent of £ 15 a flush .
the council hopes the closures will save more than £ 100,000 a year .
" it 's much cheaper to terminate the contract now than to keep providing an unwanted and unused service when we do n't have to , " she said .
the council blames the increasing number of shops and restaurants that provide customer toilets for the dwindling use of public conveniences .
