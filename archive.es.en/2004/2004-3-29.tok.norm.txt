after the owner of a six-month-old bull named simply " number 15 " died , the grieving animal made its way to the graveside , holding a vigil lasting several days and resisting numerous attempts to coax it away . " number 15 " may have spent only six months with its owner , farmer alfred g. near coburg , northern bavaria , but it developed bonds that even death had difficulty breaking . alfred had a special relationship with the 30 animals in his care .
he treated them like members of the family , living with them in a stable , content himself with a tiny kitchen and corner to sleep in .
alfred did n't have many human friends and turned often toward his four-footed companions for conversation , despite the fact that much of it was of a one-way nature . when alfred suddenly died three weeks ago at the age of 67 , for number 15 , it seems the loss was especially hard to bear .
after two weeks of alfred 's absence , number 15 left his stall , found his way to the cemetery half a mile away , jumped a wall and found his owner 's grave , pawing repeatedly at the ground . " it looked like he wanted to visit alfred , " said one eyewitness . he stayed there for two days despite efforts by locals to lure him back to his stall . local veterinarians had a hard time believing that a bull could have the ability to realize its owner had died and pine for him .
a dog maybe , but a bull ? " it shows an acute level of intelligence .
it sees incredible that a bull could find the exact spot where his master was buried , but he did it , " said klaus müller . after repeated attempts , police were finally able to get the bull back to his stable , where alfred g. 's widow took over caretaking duties .
whether in the future number 15 will be allowed to occasionally visit his late owner 's grave and complete the grieving process , the widow g. will have to decide . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .

new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .

the show includes outfits worn by the sex pistols , extravagantly off-the-wall ball gowns , and examples of westwood 's ongoing love affair with traditional tartan .
in a celebration of thirty years of a true fashion icon , the show portrays westwood as the avant-garde , non-conformist designer she is .

in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .

' celestial mountains ' beautifully underscores the central theme of mountains -lrb- shan -rrb- and rivers -lrb- shui -rrb- in traditional chinese art .
once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .

in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .

once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .

westwood 's gowns and hirst 's flies go on show in london , baselitz is in bonn whilst paris and amsterdam have slightly more traditional artistic fare to exhibit . from corsets to braces and beyond victoria and albert museum , london for the past three decades , vivienne westwood has been wooing fashionistas with her stunning , if unconventional designs .
now a collection of some 150 designs is moving from the catwalk to an exhibition hall in what is the v & a 's largest ever exhibition dedicated to a british designer .
the show includes outfits worn by the sex pistols , extravagantly off-the-wall ball gowns , and examples of westwood 's ongoing love affair with traditional tartan .
in a celebration of thirty years of a true fashion icon , the show portrays westwood as the avant-garde , non-conformist designer she is .
the show is accompanied by catwalk footage and a film on westwood 's life and career . " vivienne westwood " is on show from april 1 to july 25 and is open every day from 10.00 to 17.45 and until 22.00 on wednesdays . the photographic art of remembrance van gogh museum , amsterdam in an unusual photography exhibition , this show points the lens at 19th century snapshots turned into three dimensional objects .
in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .
back in the 1800s , the business of enhancing photographs was big , and photographers and their clients added text , flowers , cord , cigar bands , butterfly wings and even human hair to their images in a bid to fill them out .
the exhibition presents a wonderful collection of such photographs , as well as shots of families with their deceased loved ones , and even features the only two surviving portraits of vincent van gogh -lrb- 1853-1890 -rrb- , showing him at the ages of 13 and 19 . " vergeet me niet ! " -lrb- forget me not !
photography and remembrance -rrb- is on show until june 6 . the exhibition is open every day from 10.00 to 18.00 and until 22.00 on fridays . head turners kunst- und ausstellungshalle , bonn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " orange eater iii " by german artist georg baselitz .
in a comprehensive georg baselitz retrospective , this exhibition presents some 130 works from across the german artist 's creative spectrum from 1959 to the present day .
it includes his early and rarely seen popular hero paintings from the sixties , his finger paintings from the seventies and his 1980 's orange eaters .
the exhibition also includes his sculptures and even his poetical works inspired by the artist caspar david friedrich , which have been the subject of some controversy since they were installed in berlin 's reichstag in 1999 .

' celestial mountains ' beautifully underscores the central theme of mountains -lrb- shan -rrb- and rivers -lrb- shui -rrb- in traditional chinese art .
once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .
from the 4th century onwards , this religious vision of nature began to fade , and poets and painters moved in , immortalizing the image of mountain peaks with meandering rivers at their feet .
the exhibition presents a stunning panorama of beautiful chinese landscape painting from the sung dynasty to the ch 'ing dynasty . " celestial mountains : treasures from china 's museums " runs from april 1 to june 28 , and is open from thursday to monday from 10.00 to 20.00 and on wednesday from 10.00 to 22.00 . contemporary controversy tate britain , london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " god " painting by damien hirst .

called ' in-a-gadda-da-vida ' , which is a mutated reference to the biblical theme of the garden of eden , the show explores themes of life , love , sex , death and destruction .
it includes such pieces as lucas 's ' christ you know it ai n't easy ' , which is a sculpture of jesus made from cigarettes and a series of hirst 's paintings encrusted in thousands of dead flies .
besides their existing works , each artist created new pieces for the show . " in-a-gadda-da-vida " runs to may 31 and is open daily from 10.00 to 17.40 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links van gogh museum , amsterdam victoria and albert museum , london kunst- und ausstellungshalle , bonn galeries nationales du grand palais -lrb- french only -rrb- tate britain , london 9800 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .
now , anyone caught smoking illegally in pubs , restaurants , and other workplaces such as offices , hospitals and universities , will face a fine of € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,650 -rrb- .
the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .
but others say they wo n't try to enforce the ban , even though they 've been warned that they could compromise their liquor licenses if they 're found not to be making any effort to ensure a smoke-free premises . new york considers smoking ban a success ireland 's wide-reaching ban is similar to those imposed in many u.s. cities to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke .
new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .

his target is 90 percent compliance within a year . test case for europe ireland 's ban is being viewed as test case for rest of europe .
european union officials , who have been considering an eu-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , will be watching to see if other countries follow ireland 's lead .
sweden has already said it intends to ban smoking in restaurants and bars starting in 2005 . currently , the only other eu country with strict anti-smoking legislation in the workplace is the netherlands .
there , bans on smoking in places such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets have made it next to impossible for workers to take a cigarette break .
but the ban has n't yet been extended to include hotels , bars , restaurants . germany , which has one of the highest rates of smokers along with spain and greece , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat nicotine addiction .

ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .
now , anyone caught smoking illegally in pubs , restaurants , and other workplaces such as offices , hospitals and universities , will face a fine of € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,650 -rrb- .
the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .
but others say they wo n't try to enforce the ban , even though they 've been warned that they could compromise their liquor licenses if they 're found not to be making any effort to ensure a smoke-free premises . new york considers smoking ban a success ireland 's wide-reaching ban is similar to those imposed in many u.s. cities to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke .
new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .
but critics of the study say the city has n't produced separate results for bars and restaurants , and argue that the bar and night-club industry , which catered to a smoker-heavy clientele , have suffered more from the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers in new york have to get their fix outside .
now , ireland 's smokers will have to follow suit . in ireland , supporters of the ban say pubs and restaurants will finally be able to attract new customers who , in the past , may have been put off by the smoky environment . irish prime minister bertie ahern , who is both a non-smoker and a pub-goer , pointed to a recent survey that showed three out of four people who visited a bar in the past two weeks were non-smokers .
several other opinion polls taken in the past year indicate that most irish adults -lrb- 30 percent of whom smoke -rrb- support the government 's crackdown on smoking in public places . " most people have made up their minds on the issue and rightly expect that government will take the steps necessary to deal with the problem , " ahern said .
" health and quality of life issues are important to people in their place of work . " ireland 's health minister , micheal martin , who spearheaded the initiative , said he expects it will take between six to eight weeks for people to adjust to the ban .
his target is 90 percent compliance within a year . test case for europe ireland 's ban is being viewed as test case for rest of europe .
european union officials , who have been considering an eu-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , will be watching to see if other countries follow ireland 's lead .
sweden has already said it intends to ban smoking in restaurants and bars starting in 2005 . currently , the only other eu country with strict anti-smoking legislation in the workplace is the netherlands .
there , bans on smoking in places such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets have made it next to impossible for workers to take a cigarette break .
but the ban has n't yet been extended to include hotels , bars , restaurants . germany , which has one of the highest rates of smokers along with spain and greece , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat nicotine addiction .
eu health commissioner david byrnes says the government is too easy-going , considering that an average of 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases each year , and that the number of smokers remains constant , with more and more young people picking up the habit . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights .

after the owner of a six-month-old bull named simply " number 15 " died , the grieving animal made its way to the graveside , holding a vigil lasting several days and resisting numerous attempts to coax it away . " number 15 " may have spent only six months with its owner , farmer alfred g. near coburg , northern bavaria , but it developed bonds that even death had difficulty breaking . alfred had a special relationship with the 30 animals in his care .
he treated them like members of the family , living with them in a stable , content himself with a tiny kitchen and corner to sleep in .
alfred did n't have many human friends and turned often toward his four-footed companions for conversation , despite the fact that much of it was of a one-way nature . when alfred suddenly died three weeks ago at the age of 67 , for number 15 , it seems the loss was especially hard to bear .
after two weeks of alfred 's absence , number 15 left his stall , found his way to the cemetery half a mile away , jumped a wall and found his owner 's grave , pawing repeatedly at the ground . " it looked like he wanted to visit alfred , " said one eyewitness . he stayed there for two days despite efforts by locals to lure him back to his stall . local veterinarians had a hard time believing that a bull could have the ability to realize its owner had died and pine for him .
a dog maybe , but a bull ? " it shows an acute level of intelligence .
it sees incredible that a bull could find the exact spot where his master was buried , but he did it , " said klaus müller . after repeated attempts , police were finally able to get the bull back to his stable , where alfred g. 's widow took over caretaking duties .
whether in the future number 15 will be allowed to occasionally visit his late owner 's grave and complete the grieving process , the widow g. will have to decide . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .
now , anyone caught smoking illegally in pubs , restaurants , and other workplaces such as offices , hospitals and universities , will face a fine of € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,650 -rrb- .
the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .
but others say they wo n't try to enforce the ban , even though they 've been warned that they could compromise their liquor licenses if they 're found not to be making any effort to ensure a smoke-free premises . new york considers smoking ban a success ireland 's wide-reaching ban is similar to those imposed in many u.s. cities to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke .
new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .
but critics of the study say the city has n't produced separate results for bars and restaurants , and argue that the bar and night-club industry , which catered to a smoker-heavy clientele , have suffered more from the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers in new york have to get their fix outside .
now , ireland 's smokers will have to follow suit . in ireland , supporters of the ban say pubs and restaurants will finally be able to attract new customers who , in the past , may have been put off by the smoky environment . irish prime minister bertie ahern , who is both a non-smoker and a pub-goer , pointed to a recent survey that showed three out of four people who visited a bar in the past two weeks were non-smokers .
several other opinion polls taken in the past year indicate that most irish adults -lrb- 30 percent of whom smoke -rrb- support the government 's crackdown on smoking in public places . " most people have made up their minds on the issue and rightly expect that government will take the steps necessary to deal with the problem , " ahern said .
" health and quality of life issues are important to people in their place of work . " ireland 's health minister , micheal martin , who spearheaded the initiative , said he expects it will take between six to eight weeks for people to adjust to the ban .
his target is 90 percent compliance within a year . test case for europe ireland 's ban is being viewed as test case for rest of europe .
european union officials , who have been considering an eu-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , will be watching to see if other countries follow ireland 's lead .
sweden has already said it intends to ban smoking in restaurants and bars starting in 2005 . currently , the only other eu country with strict anti-smoking legislation in the workplace is the netherlands .
there , bans on smoking in places such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets have made it next to impossible for workers to take a cigarette break .
but the ban has n't yet been extended to include hotels , bars , restaurants . germany , which has one of the highest rates of smokers along with spain and greece , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat nicotine addiction .
eu health commissioner david byrnes says the government is too easy-going , considering that an average of 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases each year , and that the number of smokers remains constant , with more and more young people picking up the habit . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights .

but with little money to play with , the foundation has now announced plans to try and secure a fund from the ubs swiss bank , which acquired a former swiss subsidiary of ig farben after the end of the war . ig farben , which was linked to the manufacture of the zyklon-b poison used in the gas chambers of nazi concentration camps , filled its chemical factories with tens of thousands of slave laborers during the war .
the foundation wants to go some way to righting the wrongs of the company 's dark past . " the ig farben foundation recognises that ig farben continues to carry the weight of the guilt born out of its unreserved cooperation with the national socialist regime , and the exploitation of forced laborers during world war ii , " reads the foundation 's mission statement . fair distribution one of the founding members of the trust is the christian democrat parliamentarian otto bernhardt .
he worked as chief liquidator on the dissolution of ig farben until it was declared insolvent in november last year , and is keen to see the remains , both financial and educational help the right people . " the trust has a very valuable archive .
not valuable in material terms , but in the sense that there are masses of documents which have to be processed , and there have already been numerous requests from under-graduates and post-graduates who want access to these documents , " said bernhardt .
" and as a foundation , we are naturally willing to grant them this access .
the second and central point which we have stated repeatedly , is that if we succeed in getting money for the foundation , the majority of it should go to the victims " ernst ludwig ehrlich , an expert on judaism and an advisor to the foundation , says the foundation plans to be very careful about where the compensation money ends up . " it is not a matter of just giving a sum of money to ' company x ' in kiev , we have found possible ways of handing it to people directly , particularly in fairly remote places , " said ehrlich , who fled from the nazis . keeping shareholders at bay another of the foundation 's advisors is the former german interior minister , gerhard baum .
the fdp politician has worked as an advisor to the russian forced laborer foundation for more than ten years , and is determined that any forthcoming fund go to those who deserve it .
" although i do n't perceive this to be a danger , i will say as a preventative measure , that the trust must not be allowed to serve as a vehicle for securing the interests of the shareholders , " said baum . former ig farben shareholders are already engaged in a lawsuit with the ubs bank , claiming their share of billions of dollars worth of assets they link to the company . ig farben 's lawyers , including matthias druba , are optimistic that the insolvent company 's capital will be used to a good end . " the death and final dissolution of the company should go hand in hand with helping the victims , both victims of the holocaust in general and more specifically , the victims of ig farben , " says druba . the next step is the creation of a board of trustees and negotiations with the swiss bank .
but these things take time , and the longer the wait , the fewer the victims who stand to benefit from what is rightfully theirs . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .

new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .

but with little money to play with , the foundation has now announced plans to try and secure a fund from the ubs swiss bank , which acquired a former swiss subsidiary of ig farben after the end of the war . ig farben , which was linked to the manufacture of the zyklon-b poison used in the gas chambers of nazi concentration camps , filled its chemical factories with tens of thousands of slave laborers during the war .
the foundation wants to go some way to righting the wrongs of the company 's dark past . " the ig farben foundation recognises that ig farben continues to carry the weight of the guilt born out of its unreserved cooperation with the national socialist regime , and the exploitation of forced laborers during world war ii , " reads the foundation 's mission statement . fair distribution one of the founding members of the trust is the christian democrat parliamentarian otto bernhardt .
he worked as chief liquidator on the dissolution of ig farben until it was declared insolvent in november last year , and is keen to see the remains , both financial and educational help the right people . " the trust has a very valuable archive .
not valuable in material terms , but in the sense that there are masses of documents which have to be processed , and there have already been numerous requests from under-graduates and post-graduates who want access to these documents , " said bernhardt .
" and as a foundation , we are naturally willing to grant them this access .
the second and central point which we have stated repeatedly , is that if we succeed in getting money for the foundation , the majority of it should go to the victims " ernst ludwig ehrlich , an expert on judaism and an advisor to the foundation , says the foundation plans to be very careful about where the compensation money ends up . " it is not a matter of just giving a sum of money to ' company x ' in kiev , we have found possible ways of handing it to people directly , particularly in fairly remote places , " said ehrlich , who fled from the nazis . keeping shareholders at bay another of the foundation 's advisors is the former german interior minister , gerhard baum .
the fdp politician has worked as an advisor to the russian forced laborer foundation for more than ten years , and is determined that any forthcoming fund go to those who deserve it .
" although i do n't perceive this to be a danger , i will say as a preventative measure , that the trust must not be allowed to serve as a vehicle for securing the interests of the shareholders , " said baum . former ig farben shareholders are already engaged in a lawsuit with the ubs bank , claiming their share of billions of dollars worth of assets they link to the company . ig farben 's lawyers , including matthias druba , are optimistic that the insolvent company 's capital will be used to a good end . " the death and final dissolution of the company should go hand in hand with helping the victims , both victims of the holocaust in general and more specifically , the victims of ig farben , " says druba . the next step is the creation of a board of trustees and negotiations with the swiss bank .
but these things take time , and the longer the wait , the fewer the victims who stand to benefit from what is rightfully theirs . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .
feedback do you think the swiss bank should grant the ig farben foundation money for compensation claims ?

ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .

the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .

his target is 90 percent compliance within a year . test case for europe ireland 's ban is being viewed as test case for rest of europe .
european union officials , who have been considering an eu-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , will be watching to see if other countries follow ireland 's lead .
sweden has already said it intends to ban smoking in restaurants and bars starting in 2005 . currently , the only other eu country with strict anti-smoking legislation in the workplace is the netherlands .
there , bans on smoking in places such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets have made it next to impossible for workers to take a cigarette break .
but the ban has n't yet been extended to include hotels , bars , restaurants . germany , which has one of the highest rates of smokers along with spain and greece , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat nicotine addiction .

" number 15 " may have spent only six months with its owner , farmer alfred g. near coburg , northern bavaria , but it developed bonds that even death had difficulty breaking . alfred had a special relationship with the 30 animals in his care .
he treated them like members of the family , living with them in a stable , content himself with a tiny kitchen and corner to sleep in .
alfred did n't have many human friends and turned often toward his four-footed companions for conversation , despite the fact that much of it was of a one-way nature . when alfred suddenly died three weeks ago at the age of 67 , for number 15 , it seems the loss was especially hard to bear .
after two weeks of alfred 's absence , number 15 left his stall , found his way to the cemetery half a mile away , jumped a wall and found his owner 's grave , pawing repeatedly at the ground . " it looked like he wanted to visit alfred , " said one eyewitness . he stayed there for two days despite efforts by locals to lure him back to his stall . local veterinarians had a hard time believing that a bull could have the ability to realize its owner had died and pine for him .
a dog maybe , but a bull ? " it shows an acute level of intelligence .
it sees incredible that a bull could find the exact spot where his master was buried , but he did it , " said klaus müller . after repeated attempts , police were finally able to get the bull back to his stable , where alfred g. 's widow took over caretaking duties .
whether in the future number 15 will be allowed to occasionally visit his late owner 's grave and complete the grieving process , the widow g. will have to decide . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

westwood 's gowns and hirst 's flies go on show in london , baselitz is in bonn whilst paris and amsterdam have slightly more traditional artistic fare to exhibit . from corsets to braces and beyond victoria and albert museum , london for the past three decades , vivienne westwood has been wooing fashionistas with her stunning , if unconventional designs .
now a collection of some 150 designs is moving from the catwalk to an exhibition hall in what is the v & a 's largest ever exhibition dedicated to a british designer .
the show includes outfits worn by the sex pistols , extravagantly off-the-wall ball gowns , and examples of westwood 's ongoing love affair with traditional tartan .
in a celebration of thirty years of a true fashion icon , the show portrays westwood as the avant-garde , non-conformist designer she is .
the show is accompanied by catwalk footage and a film on westwood 's life and career . " vivienne westwood " is on show from april 1 to july 25 and is open every day from 10.00 to 17.45 and until 22.00 on wednesdays . the photographic art of remembrance van gogh museum , amsterdam in an unusual photography exhibition , this show points the lens at 19th century snapshots turned into three dimensional objects .
in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .
back in the 1800s , the business of enhancing photographs was big , and photographers and their clients added text , flowers , cord , cigar bands , butterfly wings and even human hair to their images in a bid to fill them out .
the exhibition presents a wonderful collection of such photographs , as well as shots of families with their deceased loved ones , and even features the only two surviving portraits of vincent van gogh -lrb- 1853-1890 -rrb- , showing him at the ages of 13 and 19 . " vergeet me niet ! " -lrb- forget me not !
photography and remembrance -rrb- is on show until june 6 . the exhibition is open every day from 10.00 to 18.00 and until 22.00 on fridays . head turners kunst- und ausstellungshalle , bonn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " orange eater iii " by german artist georg baselitz .
in a comprehensive georg baselitz retrospective , this exhibition presents some 130 works from across the german artist 's creative spectrum from 1959 to the present day .
it includes his early and rarely seen popular hero paintings from the sixties , his finger paintings from the seventies and his 1980 's orange eaters .
the exhibition also includes his sculptures and even his poetical works inspired by the artist caspar david friedrich , which have been the subject of some controversy since they were installed in berlin 's reichstag in 1999 . " georg baselitz : pictures that turn your head " is on show from april 2 to august 8 , and is open from thursday to sunday from 10.00 to 19.00 , and until 21.00 on tuesday and wednesday . the beauty of china galeries nationales du grand palais , paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bird and lotus " painting detail by li kuchan .
' celestial mountains ' beautifully underscores the central theme of mountains -lrb- shan -rrb- and rivers -lrb- shui -rrb- in traditional chinese art .
once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .
from the 4th century onwards , this religious vision of nature began to fade , and poets and painters moved in , immortalizing the image of mountain peaks with meandering rivers at their feet .
the exhibition presents a stunning panorama of beautiful chinese landscape painting from the sung dynasty to the ch 'ing dynasty . " celestial mountains : treasures from china 's museums " runs from april 1 to june 28 , and is open from thursday to monday from 10.00 to 20.00 and on wednesday from 10.00 to 22.00 . contemporary controversy tate britain , london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " god " painting by damien hirst .
featuring the work of angus fairhurst , damien hirst and sarah lucas , this showcase extravaganza is the first exhibition in which the three , who met at goldsmiths college in london , have all taken part .
called ' in-a-gadda-da-vida ' , which is a mutated reference to the biblical theme of the garden of eden , the show explores themes of life , love , sex , death and destruction .
it includes such pieces as lucas 's ' christ you know it ai n't easy ' , which is a sculpture of jesus made from cigarettes and a series of hirst 's paintings encrusted in thousands of dead flies .

ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking britain to impose sweeping smoking ban smoking ban begins in italy sweden bans smoking current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2004 ireland snuffs out smoking in workplaces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in public , at least , a thing of the past .
ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .
now , anyone caught smoking illegally in pubs , restaurants , and other workplaces such as offices , hospitals and universities , will face a fine of € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,650 -rrb- .
the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .
but others say they wo n't try to enforce the ban , even though they 've been warned that they could compromise their liquor licenses if they 're found not to be making any effort to ensure a smoke-free premises . new york considers smoking ban a success ireland 's wide-reaching ban is similar to those imposed in many u.s. cities to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke .
new york city released a study on monday reviewing the impact of its smoking ban , which was enforced a year ago . since then , according to city officials , new york 's bars and restaurants have prospered , with increases in jobs , liquor licenses , and business tax payments .
but critics of the study say the city has n't produced separate results for bars and restaurants , and argue that the bar and night-club industry , which catered to a smoker-heavy clientele , have suffered more from the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers in new york have to get their fix outside .
now , ireland 's smokers will have to follow suit . in ireland , supporters of the ban say pubs and restaurants will finally be able to attract new customers who , in the past , may have been put off by the smoky environment . irish prime minister bertie ahern , who is both a non-smoker and a pub-goer , pointed to a recent survey that showed three out of four people who visited a bar in the past two weeks were non-smokers .
several other opinion polls taken in the past year indicate that most irish adults -lrb- 30 percent of whom smoke -rrb- support the government 's crackdown on smoking in public places . " most people have made up their minds on the issue and rightly expect that government will take the steps necessary to deal with the problem , " ahern said .
" health and quality of life issues are important to people in their place of work . " ireland 's health minister , micheal martin , who spearheaded the initiative , said he expects it will take between six to eight weeks for people to adjust to the ban .
his target is 90 percent compliance within a year . test case for europe ireland 's ban is being viewed as test case for rest of europe .
european union officials , who have been considering an eu-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , will be watching to see if other countries follow ireland 's lead .
sweden has already said it intends to ban smoking in restaurants and bars starting in 2005 . currently , the only other eu country with strict anti-smoking legislation in the workplace is the netherlands .
there , bans on smoking in places such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets have made it next to impossible for workers to take a cigarette break .
but the ban has n't yet been extended to include hotels , bars , restaurants . germany , which has one of the highest rates of smokers along with spain and greece , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat nicotine addiction .
eu health commissioner david byrnes says the government is too easy-going , considering that an average of 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases each year , and that the number of smokers remains constant , with more and more young people picking up the habit . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights .
-lrb- jan.25 , 2004 -rrb- eu may ban smoking in restaurants , bars continuing its crackdown on nicotine addiction , the european union may seek a europe-wide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants .

after the owner of a six-month-old bull named simply " number 15 " died , the grieving animal made its way to the graveside , holding a vigil lasting several days and resisting numerous attempts to coax it away . " number 15 " may have spent only six months with its owner , farmer alfred g. near coburg , northern bavaria , but it developed bonds that even death had difficulty breaking . alfred had a special relationship with the 30 animals in his care .
he treated them like members of the family , living with them in a stable , content himself with a tiny kitchen and corner to sleep in .

westwood 's gowns and hirst 's flies go on show in london , baselitz is in bonn whilst paris and amsterdam have slightly more traditional artistic fare to exhibit . from corsets to braces and beyond victoria and albert museum , london for the past three decades , vivienne westwood has been wooing fashionistas with her stunning , if unconventional designs .
now a collection of some 150 designs is moving from the catwalk to an exhibition hall in what is the v & a 's largest ever exhibition dedicated to a british designer .
the show includes outfits worn by the sex pistols , extravagantly off-the-wall ball gowns , and examples of westwood 's ongoing love affair with traditional tartan .
in a celebration of thirty years of a true fashion icon , the show portrays westwood as the avant-garde , non-conformist designer she is .
the show is accompanied by catwalk footage and a film on westwood 's life and career . " vivienne westwood " is on show from april 1 to july 25 and is open every day from 10.00 to 17.45 and until 22.00 on wednesdays . the photographic art of remembrance van gogh museum , amsterdam in an unusual photography exhibition , this show points the lens at 19th century snapshots turned into three dimensional objects .
in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .
back in the 1800s , the business of enhancing photographs was big , and photographers and their clients added text , flowers , cord , cigar bands , butterfly wings and even human hair to their images in a bid to fill them out .
the exhibition presents a wonderful collection of such photographs , as well as shots of families with their deceased loved ones , and even features the only two surviving portraits of vincent van gogh -lrb- 1853-1890 -rrb- , showing him at the ages of 13 and 19 . " vergeet me niet ! " -lrb- forget me not !
photography and remembrance -rrb- is on show until june 6 . the exhibition is open every day from 10.00 to 18.00 and until 22.00 on fridays . head turners kunst- und ausstellungshalle , bonn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " orange eater iii " by german artist georg baselitz .
in a comprehensive georg baselitz retrospective , this exhibition presents some 130 works from across the german artist 's creative spectrum from 1959 to the present day .
it includes his early and rarely seen popular hero paintings from the sixties , his finger paintings from the seventies and his 1980 's orange eaters .
the exhibition also includes his sculptures and even his poetical works inspired by the artist caspar david friedrich , which have been the subject of some controversy since they were installed in berlin 's reichstag in 1999 . " georg baselitz : pictures that turn your head " is on show from april 2 to august 8 , and is open from thursday to sunday from 10.00 to 19.00 , and until 21.00 on tuesday and wednesday . the beauty of china galeries nationales du grand palais , paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bird and lotus " painting detail by li kuchan .
' celestial mountains ' beautifully underscores the central theme of mountains -lrb- shan -rrb- and rivers -lrb- shui -rrb- in traditional chinese art .
once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .
from the 4th century onwards , this religious vision of nature began to fade , and poets and painters moved in , immortalizing the image of mountain peaks with meandering rivers at their feet .
the exhibition presents a stunning panorama of beautiful chinese landscape painting from the sung dynasty to the ch 'ing dynasty . " celestial mountains : treasures from china 's museums " runs from april 1 to june 28 , and is open from thursday to monday from 10.00 to 20.00 and on wednesday from 10.00 to 22.00 . contemporary controversy tate britain , london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " god " painting by damien hirst .
featuring the work of angus fairhurst , damien hirst and sarah lucas , this showcase extravaganza is the first exhibition in which the three , who met at goldsmiths college in london , have all taken part .
called ' in-a-gadda-da-vida ' , which is a mutated reference to the biblical theme of the garden of eden , the show explores themes of life , love , sex , death and destruction .
it includes such pieces as lucas 's ' christ you know it ai n't easy ' , which is a sculpture of jesus made from cigarettes and a series of hirst 's paintings encrusted in thousands of dead flies .
besides their existing works , each artist created new pieces for the show .

after the owner of a six-month-old bull named simply " number 15 " died , the grieving animal made its way to the graveside , holding a vigil lasting several days and resisting numerous attempts to coax it away . " number 15 " may have spent only six months with its owner , farmer alfred g. near coburg , northern bavaria , but it developed bonds that even death had difficulty breaking . alfred had a special relationship with the 30 animals in his care .
he treated them like members of the family , living with them in a stable , content himself with a tiny kitchen and corner to sleep in .
alfred did n't have many human friends and turned often toward his four-footed companions for conversation , despite the fact that much of it was of a one-way nature . when alfred suddenly died three weeks ago at the age of 67 , for number 15 , it seems the loss was especially hard to bear .
after two weeks of alfred 's absence , number 15 left his stall , found his way to the cemetery half a mile away , jumped a wall and found his owner 's grave , pawing repeatedly at the ground . " it looked like he wanted to visit alfred , " said one eyewitness . he stayed there for two days despite efforts by locals to lure him back to his stall . local veterinarians had a hard time believing that a bull could have the ability to realize its owner had died and pine for him .
a dog maybe , but a bull ? " it shows an acute level of intelligence .
it sees incredible that a bull could find the exact spot where his master was buried , but he did it , " said klaus müller . after repeated attempts , police were finally able to get the bull back to his stable , where alfred g. 's widow took over caretaking duties .
whether in the future number 15 will be allowed to occasionally visit his late owner 's grave and complete the grieving process , the widow g. will have to decide . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

westwood 's gowns and hirst 's flies go on show in london , baselitz is in bonn whilst paris and amsterdam have slightly more traditional artistic fare to exhibit . from corsets to braces and beyond victoria and albert museum , london for the past three decades , vivienne westwood has been wooing fashionistas with her stunning , if unconventional designs .
now a collection of some 150 designs is moving from the catwalk to an exhibition hall in what is the v & a 's largest ever exhibition dedicated to a british designer .
the show includes outfits worn by the sex pistols , extravagantly off-the-wall ball gowns , and examples of westwood 's ongoing love affair with traditional tartan .
in a celebration of thirty years of a true fashion icon , the show portrays westwood as the avant-garde , non-conformist designer she is .
the show is accompanied by catwalk footage and a film on westwood 's life and career . " vivienne westwood " is on show from april 1 to july 25 and is open every day from 10.00 to 17.45 and until 22.00 on wednesdays . the photographic art of remembrance van gogh museum , amsterdam in an unusual photography exhibition , this show points the lens at 19th century snapshots turned into three dimensional objects .
in a collection of some 140 photographs from museums and private collections in north america and europe , the exhibition exposes the many ways in which early photographs were transformed into something bolder than the frozen monochrome image .
back in the 1800s , the business of enhancing photographs was big , and photographers and their clients added text , flowers , cord , cigar bands , butterfly wings and even human hair to their images in a bid to fill them out .
the exhibition presents a wonderful collection of such photographs , as well as shots of families with their deceased loved ones , and even features the only two surviving portraits of vincent van gogh -lrb- 1853-1890 -rrb- , showing him at the ages of 13 and 19 . " vergeet me niet ! " -lrb- forget me not !
photography and remembrance -rrb- is on show until june 6 . the exhibition is open every day from 10.00 to 18.00 and until 22.00 on fridays . head turners kunst- und ausstellungshalle , bonn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " orange eater iii " by german artist georg baselitz .
in a comprehensive georg baselitz retrospective , this exhibition presents some 130 works from across the german artist 's creative spectrum from 1959 to the present day .
it includes his early and rarely seen popular hero paintings from the sixties , his finger paintings from the seventies and his 1980 's orange eaters .
the exhibition also includes his sculptures and even his poetical works inspired by the artist caspar david friedrich , which have been the subject of some controversy since they were installed in berlin 's reichstag in 1999 . " georg baselitz : pictures that turn your head " is on show from april 2 to august 8 , and is open from thursday to sunday from 10.00 to 19.00 , and until 21.00 on tuesday and wednesday . the beauty of china galeries nationales du grand palais , paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bird and lotus " painting detail by li kuchan .
' celestial mountains ' beautifully underscores the central theme of mountains -lrb- shan -rrb- and rivers -lrb- shui -rrb- in traditional chinese art .
once considered as powerful gods , people made sacrifices to both mountains and rivers , and the early pan-chinese religion considered mountains as the permeable frontier to the divine world .
from the 4th century onwards , this religious vision of nature began to fade , and poets and painters moved in , immortalizing the image of mountain peaks with meandering rivers at their feet .
the exhibition presents a stunning panorama of beautiful chinese landscape painting from the sung dynasty to the ch 'ing dynasty . " celestial mountains : treasures from china 's museums " runs from april 1 to june 28 , and is open from thursday to monday from 10.00 to 20.00 and on wednesday from 10.00 to 22.00 . contemporary controversy tate britain , london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " god " painting by damien hirst .
featuring the work of angus fairhurst , damien hirst and sarah lucas , this showcase extravaganza is the first exhibition in which the three , who met at goldsmiths college in london , have all taken part .
called ' in-a-gadda-da-vida ' , which is a mutated reference to the biblical theme of the garden of eden , the show explores themes of life , love , sex , death and destruction .
it includes such pieces as lucas 's ' christ you know it ai n't easy ' , which is a sculpture of jesus made from cigarettes and a series of hirst 's paintings encrusted in thousands of dead flies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking britain to impose sweeping smoking ban smoking ban begins in italy sweden bans smoking current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2004 ireland snuffs out smoking in workplaces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in public , at least , a thing of the past .
ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .
nowhere will the drastic change be most keenly felt than in ireland 's pubs , where pints and cigarettes go hand in hand . ireland 's new anti-smoking laws - the toughest in europe - took effect on sunday at midnight , shortly after the nation 's 10,000 pubs closed , and smokers enjoyed a last , wistful cigarette with their drink .
now , anyone caught smoking illegally in pubs , restaurants , and other workplaces such as offices , hospitals and universities , will face a fine of € 3,000 -lrb- $ 3,650 -rrb- .
the only workplaces exempted from the ban are those that double as residences , such as hotel rooms , prisons , nursing homes , psychiatric hospitals . pub and restaurant owners fear a loss of business from the ban , and complain that it will be impossible to enforce .
some publicans are trying to accommodate their smoking customers by setting up heated outdoor areas with ashtrays .
but others say they wo n't try to enforce the ban , even though they 've been warned that they could compromise their liquor licenses if they 're found not to be making any effort to ensure a smoke-free premises . new york considers smoking ban a success ireland 's wide-reaching ban is similar to those imposed in many u.s. cities to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke .

in a carefully-staged photo opportunity - an event which is likely to pass relatively unnoticed in large parts of wales - the richard tome and all it contains will be passed on for political scrutiny and public debate .
at last the richard commission report on further powers for the welsh assembly - or not as the case might be - will be out in the open after almost two years of evidence taking and deliberation at every conceivable level .
and then the real debate will begin .
additional powers i understand that the report will recommend that the assembly be granted legislative powers in those areas , like health , education and transport , which it is already responsible for .
this may not happen ' big bang ' fashion , but instead by degrees .
richard is expected to go further and suggest that there could also be an additional transfer of legislative powers to areas not currently devolved .
such transfers would be subject to the approval of the secretary of state for wales .
at the moment the assembly has power to enact only secondary legislation .
what seems to be emerging then is a gradual , piecemeal progression towards a parliamentary body with legislative powers .
in other words a route map to the future of devolution in wales . "
it is the labour party which holds the key to what happens next " no-one , at this stage however , is clear how long all this will take .
on this uncertain journey it seems that one thing is certain : tax varying powers of the kind available to the scottish parliament are going to be parked in a lay by .
if they are not , they could become an obstacle to progress and no-one wants that .
also on wednesday , when we get to see the small print of the richard report , there is likely to be a recommendation that the number of assembly members be increased , possibly to 80 .
currently there are 60 assembly members , 40 of them elected on a first-past-the-post system and the remaining 20 via a top up or list system .
new referendum this allows for a degree of proportional representation or pr .
there is almost certain to be a recommendation for change here , with richard advocating a different type of pr .
the most logical alternative , it seems , is the single transferable vote or stv system .
this has already been recommended for local council elections and if applied to the assembly it would be welcomed by the liberal democrats and plaid cymru , but almost certainly rejected by the labour party .
it will be interesting too to see how the richard commission deals with the question of the need for another referendum aligned to any increase in powers .
the question of a referendum is not strictly part of the richard commission remit , but we may get pointers to its thinking on an issue which is almost certainly going to concentrate minds in the months ahead .
this has already created some strange bedfellows .
labour mps at westminster and tories in the assembly are warning that the assembly should not be given new powers without a further referendum .
if the predictions are right , all these recommended changes will lead to a significant constitutional step change for wales ; an event even , in what has been called the process of devolution .
internal struggles but there is a catch !
these and other recommendations are just that - recommendations .
they may take years - even a decade or more - to implement .
before that , there is the small matter of getting some kind of consensus in wales and before that there is a debate to be had where it really matters - in the labour party .
it is the labour party which holds the key to what happens next .
the party may get the route map next week , but right now the road ahead looks long and bumpy .
for the wales labour party , it leads to a special conference in september .
by that time , it is hoped that the internal struggles and angst will be over and the party will have arrived at a settled view which can be included in the party manifesto for the next general election .
at the moment , though , that goal seems a long way off and there are those in the party , particularly labour mps at westminster , who are openly hostile to the idea of any increase in powers .
thaw in attitude it could be that they fear a reduction in their own numbers if the assembly is given more powers .
they might sleep easier in their beds if they thought that that could be achieved gradually rather than in a rush .
downing street , meanwhile , seems positively relaxed about whether or not the assembly should have greater powers .
around the cabinet table there appears to have been a considerable thaw in attitude towards devolution in the last few years .
the inconvenience and problems associated with the introduction of welsh clauses into uk bills may have persuaded some at westminster that legislative transfer is not such a big deal after all . "
the tome delivered this wednesday may prove too heavy a burden for some , too lightweight for others " blood pressures may rise and the calm may shatter , however , if tony blair discovers , that in the run up to a general election , he has a bunch of disgruntled backbenchers in full flow against giving the assembly greater powers .
he will not want that distraction .
one thing , then , is non-negotiable in the richard commission debate : that is any reduction in the number of mps in wales .
that may be an increasingly difficult position to sustain in the long term , but for now it is taboo to even talk about it .
if the labour party holds the key to what happens to the richard commission recommendations , then one man holds that key .
that man is peter hain , leader of the house of commons and secretary of state for wales .
architect of settlement he has the unenviable task of balancing the differing needs and aspirations of all his colleagues in westminster and wales .
but peter hain is a consummate juggler and probably relishes the thought of delivering another performance worthy of the devolution big top , but he will have his work cut out and he has difficult choices to make .
it may come down to deciding whether or not he wants to be remembered as the architect of a new settlement for wales or as the person who preserved the status quo .
the other key player in this is rhodri morgan , the assembly 's first minister and leader of the labour party in wales .
he has declared his personal preference for greater powers for the assembly and his cabinet is largely supportive of that view .
' richard plus ' the trick now is to convince colleagues in other parts of the party to support that view .
the timescale on this is tight .
as outlined above , the wales labour party will hope to have arrived at a consensus by the time of their special conference in september .
in the meantime , the opposition parties will be watching with interest to see how labour resolves its internal difficulties over this issue .
of course , some opposition parties have their own problems to resolve .
plaid cymru will want ' richard plus ' .
that is a legislative parliament with tax varying powers as a step towards their ultimate goal of independence for wales .
not everyone in the party is convinced about the ' i ' part , but they will put up a united front next week .
the liberal democrats also want wales to have powers similar to scotland while the tories ' official policy is to preserve the status quo .
unanswerable case all three parties , however , may at some time in the future be prepared to put aside , at least temporarily , their public positions in favour of a coalition of ideas .
the aim of that would be to put forward a co-ordinated and unanswerable case for greater powers to westminster , whoever is in charge .
it is a long and complicated process and there are no guarantees at the end of it .
the tome delivered this wednesday may prove too heavy a burden for some , too lightweight for others .
but whatever it contains it will be the staple diet of constitutional diners for months to come .
if richard says ' yes ' , the question is will the labour party say the same thing ?

in a carefully-staged photo opportunity - an event which is likely to pass relatively unnoticed in large parts of wales - the richard tome and all it contains will be passed on for political scrutiny and public debate .
at last the richard commission report on further powers for the welsh assembly - or not as the case might be - will be out in the open after almost two years of evidence taking and deliberation at every conceivable level .
and then the real debate will begin .
additional powers i understand that the report will recommend that the assembly be granted legislative powers in those areas , like health , education and transport , which it is already responsible for .
currently , the assembly can enact only secondary legislation .
this may not happen ' big bang ' fashion , but instead by degrees .
richard is expected to go further and suggest that there could also be an additional transfer of legislative powers to areas not currently devolved .
such transfers would be subject to the approval of the secretary of state for wales .
at the moment the assembly has power to enact only secondary legislation .
what seems to be emerging then is a gradual , piecemeal progression towards a parliamentary body with legislative powers .
in other words a route map to the future of devolution in wales .
it is the labour party which holds the key to what happens next no-one , at this stage however , is clear how long all this will take .
on this uncertain journey it seems that one thing is certain : tax varying powers of the kind available to the scottish parliament are going to be parked in a lay by .
if they are not , they could become an obstacle to progress and no-one wants that .
also on wednesday , when we get to see the small print of the richard report , there is likely to be a recommendation that the number of assembly members be increased , possibly to 80 .
currently there are 60 assembly members , 40 of them elected on a first-past-the-post system and the remaining 20 via a top up or list system .
new referendum this allows for a degree of proportional representation or pr .
there is almost certain to be a recommendation for change here , with richard advocating a different type of pr .
the most logical alternative , it seems , is the single transferable vote or stv system .
this has already been recommended for local council elections and if applied to the assembly it would be welcomed by the liberal democrats and plaid cymru , but almost certainly rejected by the labour party .
welsh secretary peter hain has to approve further transfer of powers it will be interesting too to see how the richard commission deals with the question of the need for another referendum aligned to any increase in powers .
the question of a referendum is not strictly part of the richard commission remit , but we may get pointers to its thinking on an issue which is almost certainly going to concentrate minds in the months ahead .
this has already created some strange bedfellows .
labour mps at westminster and tories in the assembly are warning that the assembly should not be given new powers without a further referendum .
if the predictions are right , all these recommended changes will lead to a significant constitutional step change for wales ; an event even , in what has been called the process of devolution .
internal struggles but there is a catch !
these and other recommendations are just that - recommendations .
they may take years - even a decade or more - to implement .
the assembly currently has fewer powers than the scottish parliament before that , there is the small matter of getting some kind of consensus in wales and before that there is a debate to be had where it really matters - in the labour party .
it is the labour party which holds the key to what happens next .
the party may get the route map next week , but right now the road ahead looks long and bumpy .
for the wales labour party , it leads to a special conference in september .
by that time , it is hoped that the internal struggles and angst will be over and the party will have arrived at a settled view which can be included in the party manifesto for the next general election .
at the moment , though , that goal seems a long way off and there are those in the party , particularly labour mps at westminster , who are openly hostile to the idea of any increase in powers .
thaw in attitude it could be that they fear a reduction in their own numbers if the assembly is given more powers .
they might sleep easier in their beds if they thought that that could be achieved gradually rather than in a rush .
downing street , meanwhile , seems positively relaxed about whether or not the assembly should have greater powers .
around the cabinet table there appears to have been a considerable thaw in attitude towards devolution in the last few years .
the inconvenience and problems associated with the introduction of welsh clauses into uk bills may have persuaded some at westminster that legislative transfer is not such a big deal after all .
the tome delivered this wednesday may prove too heavy a burden for some , too lightweight for others blood pressures may rise and the calm may shatter , however , if tony blair discovers , that in the run up to a general election , he has a bunch of disgruntled backbenchers in full flow against giving the assembly greater powers .
he will not want that distraction .
one thing , then , is non-negotiable in the richard commission debate : that is any reduction in the number of mps in wales .
that may be an increasingly difficult position to sustain in the long term , but for now it is taboo to even talk about it .
if the labour party holds the key to what happens to the richard commission recommendations , then one man holds that key .
that man is peter hain , leader of the house of commons and secretary of state for wales .
architect of settlement he has the unenviable task of balancing the differing needs and aspirations of all his colleagues in westminster and wales .
but peter hain is a consummate juggler and probably relishes the thought of delivering another performance worthy of the devolution big top , but he will have his work cut out and he has difficult choices to make .
it may come down to deciding whether or not he wants to be remembered as the architect of a new settlement for wales or as the person who preserved the status quo .
the other key player in this is rhodri morgan , the assembly 's first minister and leader of the labour party in wales .
he has declared his personal preference for greater powers for the assembly and his cabinet is largely supportive of that view .
' richard plus ' the trick now is to convince colleagues in other parts of the party to support that view .
the timescale on this is tight .
as outlined above , the wales labour party will hope to have arrived at a consensus by the time of their special conference in september .
rhodri morgan has said he would like greater powers for the assembly in the meantime , the opposition parties will be watching with interest to see how labour resolves its internal difficulties over this issue .
of course , some opposition parties have their own problems to resolve .
plaid cymru will want ' richard plus ' .
that is a legislative parliament with tax varying powers as a step towards their ultimate goal of independence for wales .
not everyone in the party is convinced about the ' i ' part , but they will put up a united front next week .
the liberal democrats also want wales to have powers similar to scotland while the tories ' official policy is to preserve the status quo .
unanswerable case all three parties , however , may at some time in the future be prepared to put aside , at least temporarily , their public positions in favour of a coalition of ideas .
the aim of that would be to put forward a co-ordinated and unanswerable case for greater powers to westminster , whoever is in charge .
it is a long and complicated process and there are no guarantees at the end of it .
the tome delivered this wednesday may prove too heavy a burden for some , too lightweight for others .
but whatever it contains it will be the staple diet of constitutional diners for months to come .
if richard says ' yes ' , the question is will the labour party say the same thing ?

the company has started daily services from exeter to the mediterranean holiday destinations of alicante , malaga and faro .
there are also three new uk routes - glasgow and edinburgh in scotland and belfast in northern ireland .
business leaders hope the increased number of flights will help boost the south west economy .
it is a big boost for exeter airport , which was previously best known for offering limited schedule services , mainly to jersey , guernsey and dublin .

the un environment programme says excessive nutrients , mainly nitrogen from human activities , are causing these " dead zones " by stimulating huge growths of algae .
since the 1960s the number of oxygen-starved areas has doubled every decade , as human nitrogen production has outstripped natural sources .
unep made its remarks as it launched its global environment outlook year book 2003 .
human disturbance about 75 % of the world 's fish stocks are already being overexploited , but unep says the dead zones , which now number nearly 150 worldwide , will probably prove a greater menace .
unless urgent action is taken to tackle the sources of the problem , it is likely to escalate rapidly dr klaus toepfer unep executive director it quotes research by a team of scientists at the virginia institute of marine science in the us .
they concluded : " the history and pattern of human disturbance in terrestrial , aquatic , coastal and oceanic ecosystems have brought us to a point at which oxygen depletion is likely to become the keystone impact for the 21st century , replacing the 20th century keystone of overfishing . "
ironically , unep says , nitrogen is desperately needed in parts of the world , including much of africa , where the lack of it is reducing farmers ' yields .
washed away the amount of nitrogen used as fertiliser globally is 120 million tonnes a year , more than the 90 million tonnes produced naturally .
yet only 20 million tonnes of that is retained in the food we eat , with the rest washed away into rivers and out to sea .
the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles and power plants , and of forests and grasslands , and the draining of wetlands all contribute more nitrogen to the cycle .
this leads to the explosive blooms of algae , tiny marine plants , which sink to the seabed and decompose , using up all the oxygen , and suffocating other marine life .
unep 's executive director , dr klaus toepfer , said : " humankind is engaged in a gigantic global experiment as a result of the inefficient and often excessive use of fertilisers , the discharge of untreated sewage , and the ever-rising emissions from vehicles and factories .
" hundreds of millions of people depend on the marine environment for food , for their livelihoods and for their cultural fulfilment .
unless urgent action is taken to tackle the sources of the problem , it is likely to escalate rapidly . "
remedies available some of the dead zones are less than a square km in size , while others are up to 70,000 sq km .
examples include chesapeake bay in the us , the baltic and black seas and parts of the adriatic .
one of the best-known is in the gulf of mexico , affected by nutrients washed down the mississippi river .
other zones have appeared off south america , japan , china , australia and new zealand .
not all are permanent : some appear annually or only intermittently .
unep says reducing nitrogen discharges can restore the seas to health : an agreement by states along the river rhine has cut the amount of nitrogen entering the north sea by 37 % .
other remedies include wasting less fertiliser , cleaning vehicle exhausts , and using forests to soak up excess nitrogen .
unep launched its geo year book , highlighting emerging issues , at the meeting here of its governing council from 29 to 31 march .
delegations from more than 150 countries are expected to take part .

the un environment programme says excessive nutrients , mainly nitrogen from human activities , are causing these " dead zones " by stimulating huge growths of algae .
since the 1960s the number of oxygen-starved areas has doubled every decade , as human nitrogen production has outstripped natural sources .
unep made its remarks as it launched its global environment outlook year book 2003 .
human disturbance about 75 % of the world 's fish stocks are already being overexploited , but unep says the dead zones , which now number nearly 150 worldwide , will probably prove a greater menace .
unless urgent action is taken to tackle the sources of the problem , it is likely to escalate rapidly dr klaus toepfer unep executive director it quotes research by a team of scientists at the virginia institute of marine science in the us .
they concluded : " the history and pattern of human disturbance in terrestrial , aquatic , coastal and oceanic ecosystems have brought us to a point at which oxygen depletion is likely to become the keystone impact for the 21st century , replacing the 20th century keystone of overfishing . "
ironically , unep says , nitrogen is desperately needed in parts of the world , including much of africa , where the lack of it is reducing farmers ' yields .
washed away the amount of nitrogen used as fertiliser globally is 120 million tonnes a year , more than the 90 million tonnes produced naturally .
yet only 20 million tonnes of that is retained in the food we eat , with the rest washed away into rivers and out to sea .
the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles and power plants , and of forests and grasslands , and the draining of wetlands all contribute more nitrogen to the cycle .
this leads to the explosive blooms of algae , tiny marine plants , which sink to the seabed and decompose , using up all the oxygen , and suffocating other marine life .
unep 's executive director , dr klaus toepfer , said : " humankind is engaged in a gigantic global experiment as a result of the inefficient and often excessive use of fertilisers , the discharge of untreated sewage , and the ever-rising emissions from vehicles and factories .
" hundreds of millions of people depend on the marine environment for food , for their livelihoods and for their cultural fulfilment .
unless urgent action is taken to tackle the sources of the problem , it is likely to escalate rapidly . "
remedies available some of the dead zones are less than a square km in size , while others are up to 70,000 sq km .
examples include chesapeake bay in the us , the baltic and black seas and parts of the adriatic .
one of the best-known is in the gulf of mexico , affected by nutrients washed down the mississippi river .
other zones have appeared off south america , japan , china , australia and new zealand .
not all are permanent : some appear annually or only intermittently .
unep says reducing nitrogen discharges can restore the seas to health : an agreement by states along the river rhine has cut the amount of nitrogen entering the north sea by 37 % .
other remedies include wasting less fertiliser , cleaning vehicle exhausts , and using forests to soak up excess nitrogen .
unep launched its geo year book , highlighting emerging issues , at the meeting here of its governing council from 29 to 31 march .

overall , the indonesian government approved just $ 805m-worth -lrb- £ 444m -rrb- of fdi in january and february .
in the same period of 2003 , indonesia earned more than $ 2.4bn in fdi .
the country faces an unprecedented year of political activity , with legislative elections in april and its first direct presidential poll in july .
analysts say investors are holding large projects back until a clear picture of the outcome emerges .
ups and downs after suffering sharply during the 1997-98 asian financial crisis , indonesia has succeeded in rebuilding its reputation among international investors .
in 2003 , it had a particularly strong year , bringing in $ 13.2bn , a rise of one-third year on year .
attracting fdi is a priority for indonesia , since strong capital inflows are required to create jobs for its fast-growing population .
domestic investment increased by 20 % year on year at the beginning of 2004 .
but internal sources of financing are reckoned insufficient to power the economy , the international monetary fund has warned .

mr chirac has spent the past week weighing up his options .
he will have to choose whether to keep mr raffarin in his post and use him to push through the next round of reforms - this time to public healthcare - or whether to appoint a new prime minister .
the problem with that is that the most obvious candidate , france 's popular interior minister nicholas sarkozy , is known to want mr chirac 's job , correspondents say .

the problem with that is that the most obvious candidate , france 's popular interior minister nicholas sarkozy , is known to want mr chirac 's job , correspondents say .
so the president may prefer to keep on his unpopular but loyal prime minister to plough ahead with the next round of difficult reforms , despite voters ' discontent .

the socialists and their allies won 50 % of the second-round votes , leaving mr chirac 's centre-right governing ump party trailing on 36.9 % .
the socialists held eight councils and grabbed another 12 from the ump .
voters are thought to be angry at high unemployment , a stagnant economy and unpopular public sector reforms .
the centre-right has won only alsace so far , with the results from corsica still to come .

mr chirac has spent the past week weighing up his options .
he will have to choose whether to keep mr raffarin in his post and use him to push through the next round of reforms - this time to public healthcare - or whether to appoint a new prime minister .
