on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .

and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .

he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .

" i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .

in a joint statement released thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin said the two countries would work together to stop terrorists from obtaining or developing " nuclear , chemical , radiological or biological weapons , the means of transporting them or related materials and arms and technologies . "
" countries that have requested aid from the united nations in the fight against international terrorism " should also be supported by germany and russia , the statement read .
the two leaders said that closer cooperation would help the countries " strengthen our capabilities of preventing and reducing the consequences of terrorist attacks - also against our missions abroad . "
schröder and putin ordered a high-level working group of german and russian security officials to develop a cooperation plan .
" a heinous attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia .
the statement also described the russian federation as the target of " heinous attacks of international terrorism " and made note of the terrorist massacre at a beslan school which killed more than 350 people , many of them children .
" the monstrous terrorist act carried out against innocent children in beslan attests to a new dimension of danger . "
schröder and putin also appealed for a " central and coordinating role " of the un in the fight against terrorism .
the leaders had intended the statement to be part of opening remarks for the annual german-russian " petersburger dialogue " consultations at hamburg 's gottorf palace scheduled for friday and saturday .
traditionally , the german and russian governments hold parallel talks during consultations - but in light of the terrorist acts in russia , putin cancelled his visit this year .
nevertheless , the event will go on as planned with around 150 representatives of german and russian political , business , media and scientific organizations .
the organizers have determined to continue with the event despite the terrorist acts .

"
" countries that have requested aid from the united nations in the fight against international terrorism " should also be supported by germany and russia , the statement read .

nevertheless , the event will go on as planned with around 150 representatives of german and russian political , business , media and scientific organizations .
the organizers have determined to continue with the event despite the terrorist acts .
" we 've come to the conclusion that it would be good to carry out this dialog because we are of the opinion that , especially in times of greater distress , solidarity is important along with talk and dialogue , " said klaus mangold , a petersburg organizer . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de explosives found in st. petersburg cinema with the discovery of explosives in a theater in st. petersburg , russian authorities may have averted another beslan-like disaster .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy . " it ’ s very difficult to know if these changes will result in better prices , " he said . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " fair trade " gets boost in european stores fair trade products have officially made the jump across the atlantic .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy . " it ’ s very difficult to know if these changes will result in better prices , " he said . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " fair trade " gets boost in european stores fair trade products have officially made the jump across the atlantic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

again searching for way to increase sales , volkswagen is ready to try anything - even going back to their roots and building cars for the masses , vw managers told the bild newspaper friday .
the strategy , which worked in brazil where europe 's biggest auto maker sells the fox compact , would call for cars costing € 8,000 - € 10,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 - $ 12,000 -rrb- to be introduced in the german market .
though there are no solid plans for vw compacts in germany yet , the company knows the higher class phaeton model is n't selling well , and the vw group , which includes audi , seat and skoda , saw sale shrink 3.7 percent in august while the rest of the german auto industry was 3.1 percent lower than august 2003 .
as another way of increasing profits , vw is also thinking about cutting jobs and freezing wages in germany if management and unions are n't able to reach a compromise in labor negations next week . dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .
volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy .

indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .
" but in some local regions , we could see a change in the political atmosphere and a weakening of democratic values .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy . " it ’ s very difficult to know if these changes will result in better prices , " he said . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " fair trade " gets boost in european stores fair trade products have officially made the jump across the atlantic .

again searching for way to increase sales , volkswagen is ready to try anything - even going back to their roots and building cars for the masses , vw managers told the bild newspaper friday .
the strategy , which worked in brazil where europe 's biggest auto maker sells the fox compact , would call for cars costing € 8,000 - € 10,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 - $ 12,000 -rrb- to be introduced in the german market .
though there are no solid plans for vw compacts in germany yet , the company knows the higher class phaeton model is n't selling well , and the vw group , which includes audi , seat and skoda , saw sale shrink 3.7 percent in august while the rest of the german auto industry was 3.1 percent lower than august 2003 .
as another way of increasing profits , vw is also thinking about cutting jobs and freezing wages in germany if management and unions are n't able to reach a compromise in labor negations next week . dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .
volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "
opposing players may want to listen - he has n't been wrong about his career yet . leona frommelt / dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official site of the national football league see what kind of competition the germanator will be up against in the nfl .

" the rising energy prices affect regional traffic as well , " a spokesman said , referring to the bahn 's decision thursday to raise prices for long-distance trains .
electricity , gas and diesel cost the bahn about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- a year .
the new prices are n't in place yet , since germany 's 16 states , which pay to help maintain regional train tracks , must approve regional ticket price hikes .
the bahn alone decides on long-distance ticket prices .
a spokesman would not comment on the validity of rumors that some long-distance trains would be cut , forcing passengers to use the company 's more expensive high-speed ice rail service , the financial times deutschland reported . regional ticket prices increased last winter by 4.1 percent , long-distance prices went up in the spring by 3.4 percent . more briefs 10.09.2004 -pipe- vw may build cars for the masses ...

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .
khan , who was in charge of pakistan 's nuclear program from 1976 to 2001 , was pardoned by pakistani president pervez musharraf in february for transferring nuclear technology to other countries , including north korea . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans allegedly helped libyan nuclear program libya 's nuclear disarmament has provided valuable information on its suppliers : authorities are now investigating two german businessmen suspected of aiding libya with nuclear arms in 2001 .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .
khan , who was in charge of pakistan 's nuclear program from 1976 to 2001 , was pardoned by pakistani president pervez musharraf in february for transferring nuclear technology to other countries , including north korea . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans allegedly helped libyan nuclear program libya 's nuclear disarmament has provided valuable information on its suppliers : authorities are now investigating two german businessmen suspected of aiding libya with nuclear arms in 2001 .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.09.2004 " designer baby " gets go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british legislation allows the use of embryos in stem cell therapy a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .
the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.09.2004 germany seeks toll collect compensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks have been getting an almost free ride for over a year the german government announced thursday it would seek almost € 4.5 billion in compensation from the companies it contracted to build a high-tech highway toll system for heavy trucks . originally scheduled to launch in august 2003 , the satellite system designed by a automaker daimlerchrysler and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom failed and is currently being replaced by a less-sophisticated system .
the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.09.2004 germany seeks toll collect compensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks have been getting an almost free ride for over a year the german government announced thursday it would seek almost € 4.5 billion in compensation from the companies it contracted to build a high-tech highway toll system for heavy trucks . originally scheduled to launch in august 2003 , the satellite system designed by a automaker daimlerchrysler and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom failed and is currently being replaced by a less-sophisticated system .
the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .
transportation expert albert schmidt for the government coalition 's junior partner , the green party , said the new management at toll collect had given " reason for optimism " and the " toll debacle " had likely passed .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .

nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .

german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .

ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .
khan , who was in charge of pakistan 's nuclear program from 1976 to 2001 , was pardoned by pakistani president pervez musharraf in february for transferring nuclear technology to other countries , including north korea . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans allegedly helped libyan nuclear program libya 's nuclear disarmament has provided valuable information on its suppliers : authorities are now investigating two german businessmen suspected of aiding libya with nuclear arms in 2001 .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 iraqi president meets with german officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's € 5 billion among friends ?
on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .
a german-iraq chamber of commerce , which could be used to better facilitate business contacts , is still nonexistent . dw staff -lrb- dre / ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .

german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .

german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu .

prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .

another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd !

they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 iraqi president meets with german officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's € 5 billion among friends ?
on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "
opposing players may want to listen - he has n't been wrong about his career yet . leona frommelt / dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official site of the national football league see what kind of competition the germanator will be up against in the nfl .

nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .

german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .

ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .

two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .

but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .

another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .

as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .
transportation expert albert schmidt for the government coalition 's junior partner , the green party , said the new management at toll collect had given " reason for optimism " and the " toll debacle " had likely passed .
however , schmidt warned , " if the system does n't work , things will be tough and unappetizing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2004 ' germanator ' tackles american football großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann -lrb- 6 -rrb- fulfilled his dream of giving and taking a nfl beating another german athlete looks ready to follow in basketball star dirk nowitzki 's footsteps and seek sports fame in the us .
the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "
opposing players may want to listen - he has n't been wrong about his career yet . leona frommelt / dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links official site of the national football league see what kind of competition the germanator will be up against in the nfl .

eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time .

adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .
the report will the basis of a decision by eu leaders in december on whether the begin membership talks with turkey , the only eu candidate that has failed so far to begin negotiations with the 25-member bloc .
turkey says it earned the right to get a firm date for the start of the accession talks thanks to the series of reforms it adopted since it was officially recognized an eu candidate in 1999 . " as i am going back to brussels , i am certain that turkey is really determined .
we will make a fair and objective evaluation , " verheugen told reporters . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement chief sees turkey 's ' moment of truth ' as european union leaders prepare to decide whether to open membership talks with turkey , eu enlargement chief günther verheugen said monday that ankara was facing its moment of truth .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .

nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .

german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , dr. abdul qadeer khan , is seen in this march 19 , 1998 photo .
reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .
khan , who was in charge of pakistan 's nuclear program from 1976 to 2001 , was pardoned by pakistani president pervez musharraf in february for transferring nuclear technology to other countries , including north korea . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans allegedly helped libyan nuclear program libya 's nuclear disarmament has provided valuable information on its suppliers : authorities are now investigating two german businessmen suspected of aiding libya with nuclear arms in 2001 .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.09.2004 " designer baby " gets go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british legislation allows the use of embryos in stem cell therapy a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .
the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

" the rising energy prices affect regional traffic as well , " a spokesman said , referring to the bahn 's decision thursday to raise prices for long-distance trains .
electricity , gas and diesel cost the bahn about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- a year .
the new prices are n't in place yet , since germany 's 16 states , which pay to help maintain regional train tracks , must approve regional ticket price hikes .
the bahn alone decides on long-distance ticket prices .
a spokesman would not comment on the validity of rumors that some long-distance trains would be cut , forcing passengers to use the company 's more expensive high-speed ice rail service , the financial times deutschland reported . regional ticket prices increased last winter by 4.1 percent , long-distance prices went up in the spring by 3.4 percent . more briefs 10.09.2004 -pipe- vw may build cars for the masses ...

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .
the report will the basis of a decision by eu leaders in december on whether the begin membership talks with turkey , the only eu candidate that has failed so far to begin negotiations with the 25-member bloc .
turkey says it earned the right to get a firm date for the start of the accession talks thanks to the series of reforms it adopted since it was officially recognized an eu candidate in 1999 . " as i am going back to brussels , i am certain that turkey is really determined .
we will make a fair and objective evaluation , " verheugen told reporters . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement chief sees turkey 's ' moment of truth ' as european union leaders prepare to decide whether to open membership talks with turkey , eu enlargement chief günther verheugen said monday that ankara was facing its moment of truth .

eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time .

adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .

their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .

" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .

eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .
transportation expert albert schmidt for the government coalition 's junior partner , the green party , said the new management at toll collect had given " reason for optimism " and the " toll debacle " had likely passed .

consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .
a german-iraq chamber of commerce , which could be used to better facilitate business contacts , is still nonexistent . dw staff -lrb- dre / ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .
-lrb- april 29 , 2004 -rrb- bernd erbel : germany ’ s new ambassador to iraq the diplomat and middle east enthusiast bernd erbel formally assumed his duties as german ambassador to iraq this week .
as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .
khan , who was in charge of pakistan 's nuclear program from 1976 to 2001 , was pardoned by pakistani president pervez musharraf in february for transferring nuclear technology to other countries , including north korea . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans allegedly helped libyan nuclear program libya 's nuclear disarmament has provided valuable information on its suppliers : authorities are now investigating two german businessmen suspected of aiding libya with nuclear arms in 2001 .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.09.2004 germany seeks toll collect compensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks have been getting an almost free ride for over a year the german government announced thursday it would seek almost € 4.5 billion in compensation from the companies it contracted to build a high-tech highway toll system for heavy trucks . originally scheduled to launch in august 2003 , the satellite system designed by a automaker daimlerchrysler and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom failed and is currently being replaced by a less-sophisticated system .
the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .
transportation expert albert schmidt for the government coalition 's junior partner , the green party , said the new management at toll collect had given " reason for optimism " and the " toll debacle " had likely passed .
however , schmidt warned , " if the system does n't work , things will be tough and unappetizing .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu .

prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .
a german-iraq chamber of commerce , which could be used to better facilitate business contacts , is still nonexistent . dw staff -lrb- dre / ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "

he 's now joined the ranks of other notables in the " guinness book of world records " . he ca n't fly like dumbo , but jack the basset hound from fulda , germany can sure get tripped up by his extra long ears .
jack 's measure 33.2 centimeters , just over 13 inches , and the people at the guinness book of world records have confirmed it : that 's truly superlative when it comes to dog ears . jack has lived with his family in fulda since he was eight weeks old .
at first , according to his owner , carsten baus , jack 's ears did n't seem like anything special .
but as he got older , his ears experienced a growth spurt , and … .kept growing .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu .

prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.09.2004 germany seeks toll collect compensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks have been getting an almost free ride for over a year the german government announced thursday it would seek almost € 4.5 billion in compensation from the companies it contracted to build a high-tech highway toll system for heavy trucks . originally scheduled to launch in august 2003 , the satellite system designed by a automaker daimlerchrysler and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom failed and is currently being replaced by a less-sophisticated system .
the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.09.2004 germany seeks toll collect compensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks have been getting an almost free ride for over a year the german government announced thursday it would seek almost € 4.5 billion in compensation from the companies it contracted to build a high-tech highway toll system for heavy trucks . originally scheduled to launch in august 2003 , the satellite system designed by a automaker daimlerchrysler and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom failed and is currently being replaced by a less-sophisticated system .
the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .
a german-iraq chamber of commerce , which could be used to better facilitate business contacts , is still nonexistent . dw staff -lrb- dre / ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .
-lrb- april 29 , 2004 -rrb- bernd erbel : germany ’ s new ambassador to iraq the diplomat and middle east enthusiast bernd erbel formally assumed his duties as german ambassador to iraq this week .
as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job .

the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .

there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .
" but in some local regions , we could see a change in the political atmosphere and a weakening of democratic values .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .

and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .

on day two of a three-day visit to germany , iraq 's new president met with german chancellor schröder and president köhler .
both sides sought to intensify cooperation , focusing on debt relief and reconstruction . after meeting with several high-ranking german government officials on thursday , iraqi president ghazi mashal ajil al-yawer told reporters he had received " positive answers " to many of his most important questions , particularly those concerning debt relief . for the president of a country saddled with € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in debt , € 5.3 million of which is owed to germany , that 's good news .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would - along with the so-called paris club , a group of nations to whom iraq is indebted - work to " substantially " reduce iraqi debt .
however , he did not give details or name an exact figure . german president horst köhler echoed the chancellor 's desire to see iraq get back on its feet with german help .
" germany can and should use its influence in the international community to help bring about debt relief , " he told reporters after his meeting with yawer . re-establishing relations a few weeks ago , germany and iraq re-established a diplomatic relationship that went sour during the persian gulf war in 1991 . as his country 's new ambassador to iraq , germany 's bernd erbel presented yawer his portfolio , and his counterpart , alla abdul madshid hussein al-hashimi , did the same in berlin .
the diplomatic niceties were a necessity ahead of yawer 's visit to berlin , the first since he became iraq 's first postwar president in june . german police , companies in iraq - but not troops for some time now , schröder and his deputies have shown an interest in closer cooperation with the new government in iraq .
the work german police have been doing in the united arab emirates training the new iraqi police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridge being built by coalition forces in iraq force is just one example .
german firms like siemens and deutsche telekom are also working on rebuilding the infrastructure as subcontractors to american companies . what 's more , germany has pledged more than € 100 million to help rebuild , half of that through eu funds .
and the government pledged an additional € 5 million to help the united nations ' work in the war-torn country . but the german government has , until now , left it at that . talk of sending german troops to the region has been routinely rejected by government leaders .
even us secretary of state colin powell conceded that germany would not send troops to help the overstretched multinational force in the country . " we … will engage ourselves within the realm of our possibilities , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
after meeting with yawer , germany 's minister for development , heidemarie wiecorek-zeul , echoed the sentiment , stating that it would be difficult to send personal - even development workers , " given the extremely dangerous security situation . " getting more german companies to invest immediately following the end of major combat operations , german , as well as french , companies were shut out of bidding for major reconstruction contracts because of their government 's opposition to the war .
though washington has since changed its tune , only 60 german companies have struck up business again , one-third of which were active in iraq before the coalition invasion in march 2003 . chief among the concerns is security as well as confusion over what sort of business legislation is currently in place .
in the past , german firms investing in foreign countries have been emboldened by export insurance from the government , so-called hermes guarantees , named after the agency that provides them . the government has n't extended any guarantees so far .
a german-iraq chamber of commerce , which could be used to better facilitate business contacts , is still nonexistent . dw staff -lrb- dre / ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .
-lrb- april 29 , 2004 -rrb- bernd erbel : germany ’ s new ambassador to iraq the diplomat and middle east enthusiast bernd erbel formally assumed his duties as german ambassador to iraq this week .
as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy . " it ’ s very difficult to know if these changes will result in better prices , " he said . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " fair trade " gets boost in european stores fair trade products have officially made the jump across the atlantic .

similar codes have been tried in the past but they failed to reach all aspects of the market .
but not everyone is happy with the new code of conduct . unhealthy working conditions , terribly long hours , bad pay - that ’ s the reality for many workers at coffee plantations .
their suffering is made worse by poor national legislation , an extremely competitive market and overproduction which keeps coffee prices low . calls for code human rights organizations , politicians , and some of the major businesses in the coffee industry have long called for universal social , ecological and economical standards to be put in place .
now the key players in the sector have come together to create just such a code .
it ’ s called the common code for the coffee community , or cccc . manoel bertone is the executive director of the national coffee council of brazil , one of the world ’ s largest coffee-producing countries .
he ’ s been working on the cccc project since it started two years ago .
bertone explained that some of the initiatives already in place are too limited and says that their aim is to change things right from the root up . " they pay a little more and put a label on it but that won ’ t solve the problem , " he said . the code outlines things like environmental standards , long-term ecological planning , legislation improvement , social planning , and work ethics .
all of the important roasting companies , for instance tchibo in germany , kraft , and nestle have signed up to the project .
ngo ’ s like greenpeace , oxfam , unions and other interest groups are also on board and it has backing from the international coffee organization and the united nations . transfair says code is not enough but one group has decided not to participate , the german-based transfair group which supports fair trade .
it thinks the cccc code doesn ’ t go far enough in supporting the smaller coffee producers .
dieter overath is the head of the company . " the clear difference between fair trade and social standards is that social standards are automatically included in fair trade deals , " overath said .
" we focus on keeping a high price so that the producers can improve their working and living conditions . " overath is also concerned about how these standards proposed in the cccc will be enforced and controlled .
the project is directed by a steering committee made up of people representing groups from all aspects of the coffee sector .
the groups will then implement the codes on a national level . bertone said the way to make things happen is to keep everyone involved as much as possible .
he ’ s hopeful that progress will be made but he admitted it wo n't be easy . " it ’ s very difficult to know if these changes will result in better prices , " he said . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " fair trade " gets boost in european stores fair trade products have officially made the jump across the atlantic .

a south african court on thursday charged two german men who live in the country with illegally exporting equipment used to enrich uranium needed to make nuclear weapons . thursday 's double arraignments came one day after gerhard wisser , 66 , and daniel geiges , 65 , were arrested by authorities .
the men are alleged to have been involved in an international nuclear smuggling network linked to abdul qadeer khan , the founder of pakistan ’ s nuclear program . last week a south african businessman was arrested on related charges .
for wisser , it was the second arrest in one month 's time .
officials first arrested him in germany just over two weeks ago after the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said he was suspected of helping libya acquire atomic weapons technology in 2001 .
he was later released on bail and allowed to return to south africa , where he has been a longtime resident .
prosecutors believe wisser served as the middleman in the operation , passing on illegal equipment to a network based in dubai to supply libya with gas centrifuge equipment used for uranium enrichment .
' very serious ' charges sally de beer , spokeswoman for the national police commissioner , said the two had already appeared in court and that the charges are significant .
" the charges are very serious and there are international links and we 've been working together closely with the national prosecution authority but at this stage we are collecting evidence , " she said .
on thursday , wisser 's lawyers said their client would fight all the charges against him .
" we are pleading not guilty and we are going to fight it right till the end , " anand choudree told reporters .
the arrest of the two men follows the withdrawal of similar charges against south african businessman johan meyer in johannesburg on wednesday .
meyer is understood to have turned state witness , but prosecutors have offered no explanation for why the charges have been dropped .
the businessman , who is director of an engineering company in johannesburg , had been charged with possession and production of certain components of a centrifuge enrichment plant without the necessary permission from the government .
a dangerous find police confiscated 11 containers of uranium enrichment material from meyer 's factory .
they were then sealed and transported to a secure site at the pelindaba nuclear research plant near pretoria .
the items do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction , but they are essential components in the process to enrich uranium to make it suitable for nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , dr. abdul qadeer khan , is seen in this march 19 , 1998 photo .
reports said the arrest of the men in south africa took place in cooperation with security agencies from europe and america .
the americans have expressed their concerns that khan -lrb- photo -rrb- may have helped iran and other countries with their nuclear programs .
some of the nuclear weapons , they fear , may have been obtained by terrorist groups such as al qaeda .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract .

in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .

the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.09.2004 " designer baby " gets go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british legislation allows the use of embryos in stem cell therapy a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .
the process includes the creation of an embryo to provide life-saving cells . a couple in northern ireland have been permitted under a recent law in great britain to pursue the process which would lead to the first " designer baby , " an embryo which would provide cells that could help treat the family 's seriously ill three-year-old son . to look at joshua fletcher , one would not see any signs of the illness .
but he has a rare and potentially fatal blood disease called diamond blackfan anemia .
in two years time , joshua will be too old for the stem-cell therapy which could keep him alive .
so for his parents , news that the treatment has been authorized is like the revocation of a death sentence . " the chances are 95 percent in favor that joshua with be cured by this therapy , " said his father , joe fletcher .
" if we do not do this , he will soon die . "
this new chance of life will come from an artificially created embryo , designed to provide cells for joshua which in turn will produce the healthy red blood cells that will keep him alive . the possible treatment was made a reality in the uk in july when legislation was passed to lift restrictions on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
until then , it was illegal to biologically alter an embryo unless it was ill .
the new law makes it legal to generate an embryo for the purpose of creating stem cells for a sick relative .
the fletchers , who live in a small village in northern ireland , will be the first family to benefit from the new legislation . opposition to use of embryos there has been outcry from pro-life groups over the legislation and the granting of permission to the fletchers .
as many as a dozen embryos will be produced through the in-vitro fertilization treatments but only the one with a perfect genetic match will survive and be carried by julie fletcher for a full-term of nine months .
the destruction of the other embryos is the aspect that has generated most of the opposition . if the child is survives to full term and is born , blood will be taken from the umbilical cord containing the cells which should cure joshua .
it will be a further six months until the doctors can ascertain whether the treatment was successful or not . despite being legal , the method carries its fair share of controversy in britain as in many other corners of the globe .
julie fletcher says she does not understand this . " i will love this child , regardless , but all the more if the therapy should succeed , " she told reporters .
" we wanted one more child .
it 's better when we do n't leave it up to the genetic lottery and check before whether this baby also carries the signs for the illness or not . " not designer baby but life saver dr mohammed taranissi , one of the uk 's top fertility doctors and the man who will be in charge of the procedure , told the belfast telegraph newspaper : " i do not see any other outcome other than a successful one for the fletchers .
after all , the principle has already been accepted and there is nothing in the fletchers ' case to throw up any problems . " he dismisses the " designer baby " accusations . " it is not a matter of selecting the color of eyes or choosing between a girl or a boy , " he said .
" it is a matter of helping a seriously ill child . " germany must allow research , says clement the news from northern ireland comes a day after german economy minister wolfgang clement called for germany to abandon all restrictions on stem-cell research if it wants to create a strong , home-grown biotech industry . " we have to allow unlimited research on stem cells in germany , " he told the german parliament in a debate on his ministry 's 2005 budget on thursday . germany has allowed limited research into stem cells since 2002 but under strict conditions ; for example , the cells must already exist and not be reproduced through cloning .
germany 's stance is more liberal than in some countries , such as in the united states where such research is discouraged , but is less liberal than in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules for embryo research the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany .

" the rising energy prices affect regional traffic as well , " a spokesman said , referring to the bahn 's decision thursday to raise prices for long-distance trains .
electricity , gas and diesel cost the bahn about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- a year .
the new prices are n't in place yet , since germany 's 16 states , which pay to help maintain regional train tracks , must approve regional ticket price hikes .
the bahn alone decides on long-distance ticket prices .
a spokesman would not comment on the validity of rumors that some long-distance trains would be cut , forcing passengers to use the company 's more expensive high-speed ice rail service , the financial times deutschland reported . regional ticket prices increased last winter by 4.1 percent , long-distance prices went up in the spring by 3.4 percent . more briefs 10.09.2004 -pipe- vw may build cars for the masses ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .
although they have made it into regional assemblies in the past , their tenures there have usually been short due to infighting and incompetence . this time , however , the npd and dvu agreed on a new strategy in which the npd has limited its campaign to saxony , where it is strongest , and skipped the state of brandenburg , where the dvu will be the only far-right party on the ticket .
this way , they hope to avoid splitting the vote on sept .
19 . no repeat of weimar while the two recent polls have been contradictory regarding whether the far-right will pass the five percent hurdle and make it into state government after the upcoming elections , political scientist patzelt said he would n't be surprised if saxony 's legislature had to make room for several right-wing lawmakers . " the potential in saxony for right-wing voting is around 13 or 14 percent , " he said .
" you have to consider the ' lying factor , " ' where people are reluctant to tell pollsters their true voting intentions .
he pointed to the case of 1998 elections in saxony-anhalt , where three percent of those polled before the vote said they would cast ballots for the dvu .
on election night , results showed that the party had actually garnered 12.9 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd flags but most experts say although the current rise of the far-right is worrying , it does not represent a fundamental threat to german democracy . " it 's not dangerous in the sense that we 're seeing a repeat of the weimar republic , " said the free university 's funke , referring to the german government in the 1920s and early 1930s which fell to the nazis .

the system has been plagued with technical troubles - including problems with the 3,000 roadside terminals for payment , the 150 control bridges and the electronic devices truck drivers must install in their rigs in order to operate within germany .
in addition to the 2003 failure , toll collect failed to meet a second deadline last year and has now proposed a simpler system that is planned to go into operation in january 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister manfred stolpe on thursday , german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament the government would seek a settlement with toll collect in arbitration , citing " numerous violations of its business contract . "
consortium : claim unwarranted however , toll collect dismissed the demand as " unwarranted " and " unfounded . "
in a separate statement , daimlerchrysler officials said that none of the coalition partners had foreseen the delays that would come and that the government knew there were " possible risks involved in the development of the project and its implementation " when it signed the contract .
members of germany 's main opposition party , the christian democratic union , on friday backed the companies .
" there 's a lot of wishful thinking going on here , " cdu parliamentary group deputy chairman klaus lippold told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
the government 's contract with the consortium , he said , " was so poorly negotiated ... that stolpe 's bill wo n't bear any fruit . "
the politician said that although it was appropriate for berlin to seek compensation , the contract it signed with toll collect excludes any settlements related to debts .
earlier this year , the toll collect consortium , which also includes france 's cofiroute , agreed to pay up to € 780 million in penalties a year in case of future delays as well as € 1 billion a year if the system fails during operation .
plugging budget holes the debacle has proven embarrassing for two of germany 's largest companies as well as the government in berlin , which had sought to help close its budget hole with the tolls , which were expected to generate € 2.4 billion in additional annual revenues for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toll collect payment terminal - already at a gas station near you the government is still working with the toll collect consortium , which shuffled its management and is currently developing an alternative system that is targeted to go online in january .
transportation expert albert schmidt for the government coalition 's junior partner , the green party , said the new management at toll collect had given " reason for optimism " and the " toll debacle " had likely passed .
however , schmidt warned , " if the system does n't work , things will be tough and unappetizing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2004 german far right exploiting reform anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neo-nazi npd is strong in the eastern state of saxony widespread discontent over planned labor market and welfare reforms is benefiting german far-right political parties .
there are concerns that extremists could win seats in state parliaments in two elections on sept .
19 . most of the demonstrators who have been rallying every monday for the past month against the government 's planned reforms would describe themselves as being on the left of the political spectrum .
indeed , the mass protests have enabled the political successors of the east german communists , the far-left party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , to end their recent exile in the political wilderness and , according to polls , even charge ahead of mainstream parties in some areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this npd signs says germany 's borders should be closed .
but it 's not just the left wing that is benefiting from the disgruntlement that many - especially in eastern germany - feel at the planned changes to the welfare system .
a look at some of the angry signs carried at the protests or mounted along roads reveals germany 's far-right is also enjoying a boon from tapping into people 's frustration and fear . " the far-right has been helped immensely by hitching itself to the anti-hartz iv campaign , " werner patzelt , professor of comparative government at the dresden technical university , told dw-world , referring to the name of the proposed reforms .
" while there is no organizational cooperation between the far-right and far-left , the right-wing extremists have been able to capitalize on the same issues that the left has . " next stop : state parliament ? experts warn that in elections in the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony scheduled for sept .
19 , the far-right could poll above the five percent mark , thereby winning seats in the state parliaments there . a survey carried out on sunday by the infratest polling group showed that in saxony the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , germany 's oldest far-right party and considered by many to be its most dangerous , could get up to seven percent of the vote .
another survey carried out by the forsa organization , however , showed the npd getting no more than four percent . bildunterschrift : the banner says " vote npd ! " the surveys showed that those likely to vote for the far-right were primarily younger people , generally working class or unemployed , who do not have a university education . " it 's generally people from the lower social groups , who have a lot of fear about their future , " patzelt said . the reforms , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , aim to stabilize germany 's overburdened social security system and boost the country 's economy .
they would cut benefits to many long-term unemployed , which officials hope would encourage them to find jobs .
but among those in eastern germany especially - where the unemployment rate hovers at around 20 percent in many areas - the reforms are perceived as unfair .
many say they would gladly work , if the jobs were there . " people see that even after the reforms take effect , there is little chance of their finding jobs , and it 's made them enraged , " hajo funke , a professor of political science at berlin 's free university , said .
" that rage is being misused by the right . " new strategy and sophistication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinhead at an npd demonstration .
part of the recent success of the far-right can be traced to some clever image polishing .
while traditionally seen by many as an unruly group of violent skinheads , the npd and other groups have tempered their image as of late , taming down some of their more extreme views and recasting themselves as " social-revolutionary nationalists " on the side of the little guy . " their public manner has changed , " said political scientist patzelt .
" they now present themselves as civilized and professional and try to hide the ugly side .
but it 's deceptive . " he said the npd and another prominent right-wing party , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have not changed their basic beliefs , which include anti-semitic and racist views .
the dvu has called for " criminal foreigners " to be expelled .
its posters demanded " german jobs for germans first . "
both are strongly against turkey possibly joining the eu . the npd 's candidate in saxony , holger apfel , has even called for germany to reclaim lands lost after 1945 which now belong to poland and russia . " nothing and nobody will keep us from our struggle for the reich , " he was quoted by the newsmagazine der spiegel . unlike in some other european countries , germany 's far-right movement has never been able to get a strong foothold in the country or unify itself under a single leader .

"
eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership . eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen thursday praised turkey for progress achieved in embracing european union norms , but warned that plans to recriminalize adultery would be mistake as he concluded a key visit to the mainly muslim country . " turkey has become a different country in the past five or ten years .
there are impressive developments in many fields , " verheugen was quoted by the cnn-turk news channel as saying .
he added that some problems , such as improving the rights of minorities , remained , but acknowledged that implementing the reforms required time . " the transformation in turkey will not happen overnight , " he said in the televised statement . the commissioner called for greater determination to fight torture and punish those responsible , greater cultural rights for the kurds and measures to develop the country 's impoverished mainly kurdish southeast . but he also had words of caution for the government on a draft law which aims to bring back prison sentences for adultery , eight years after the crime was struck from the statute book .
adultery used to be illegal in turkey until 1996 , when the constitutional court struck the law down because it penalized women more than men .
men were deemed to have been adulterous if they were involved in a long-term affair ; but women could be charged if they were unfaithful only once . impression of adopting islamic law verheugen told the turkish vatan newspaper that if turkey tries to include crimes that are not in other countries ' laws in its penal code , european union countries could interpret this as islamic law entering turkish law .
he added that he was not " defending adultery " , but said " turkey should not give the impression ... that it is introducing islamic elements into its legal system while engaged in a great project such as the eu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , a devout muslim , says the bill will help protect women from deception .
however , women 's groups and liberal commentators in turkey have condemned the bill , saying it would be used against women and pushes the secular muslim state closer to an islamic legal model . the bill , part of a vast overhaul of the turkish penal code , is expected to go before parliament next week where the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- has a nearly two-thirds majority . the government says the penal code bill , which includes a ban on torture and an extension of civil liberties , are designed to bring turkey in line with legislation in eu member states . " i can not understand how a measure like this could be considered at such a time , " verheugen said .
" it can only be a joke .
it would be a mistake to try to restore it -lrb- adultery -rrb- to the criminal code . " the commissioner 's warning came in contrast to the praise he heaped on ankara during his visit , raising hopes over the country 's decades-long ambition to integrate with the eu . assessment visit also prompts praise verheugen 's official four-day visit to turkey is an assessment trip before the european commission assesses in october turkey 's progress in catching up with european norms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european community , 2004 .
the report will the basis of a decision by eu leaders in december on whether the begin membership talks with turkey , the only eu candidate that has failed so far to begin negotiations with the 25-member bloc .
turkey says it earned the right to get a firm date for the start of the accession talks thanks to the series of reforms it adopted since it was officially recognized an eu candidate in 1999 . " as i am going back to brussels , i am certain that turkey is really determined .
we will make a fair and objective evaluation , " verheugen told reporters . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu enlargement chief sees turkey 's ' moment of truth ' as european union leaders prepare to decide whether to open membership talks with turkey , eu enlargement chief günther verheugen said monday that ankara was facing its moment of truth .

the new name to remember is constantin ritzmann and he 's playing in the national football league . when ritzmann steps onto the field as defensive end for the buffalo bills on sept .
12 , he 'll be the first german to play in america 's professional football league .
nfl scouts in europe call the 24-year-old one of germany 's best prospects , a sentiment he confirmed during his time at the university of tennessee , where the 6-foot-3-inch , 254-pound -lrb- 190 cm , 114 kg -rrb- man from berlin captained the team in 2003 after missing the entire 2002 season with a knee injury .
it was a solid performance in training camp that set ritzmann apart from three other german players looking for positions on nfl teams and earned him a two-year contract with the buffalo bills , where he 'll wear number 91 .
" i 'm still a little shocked , " he said of his success .
" for me it 's not all quite real yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritzmann at the university of tennessee ritzmann 's career advancement began in earnest during his last year at the university of tennessee where he was the only defensive lineman to start every game , sacked opposing quarterbacks three times on his own , once assisting , and tallied a total of 52 tackles .
german fans love local teams though not a hotbed of american football , germany does have a professional league with 11 teams .
most players in the german league are american professionals who did n't get a full-time spot on nfl teams .
but that does n't stop their fans from filling stadiums in berlin and frankfurt from cheering for the local team , although some believe the cheerleaders bring as many fans to the stadium as the game 's touchdowns do .
ritzmann also once played for the berlin adler and hamburg blue devils in the german league , but at the age of 18 went to the united states while taking part in an nfl development program .
as an exchange student , he attended north florida christian high school and played one year of football there .
the school won the state championship and ritzmann earned a spot on florida 's state squad .
two-year contract worth $ 500,000 as a first-year nfl player , ritzmann will earn the league minimum of $ 230,000 per year , but said he knows he 'll have to prove himself before he 's able to command a salary comparable to the $ 98 million quarterback peyton manning will earn in seven years .
" of course it would be great if i could sack one of the big quarterbacks like donovan mcnabb or peyton manning , " ritzmann said .
" and i 'm sure that 's going to happen in the future . "

many pages have contemporary annotations many of the quartos featured in the online collection are from collections amassed by king george iii and 18th century actor david garrick .
the different versions of plays show that some of the most famous lines in the shakespearean canon changed from one performance to another .
for instance hamlet 's famous line : " to be , or not to be , that is the question " appears in a quarto from 1605 .
however in an earlier edition produced in 1603 it is written as : " to be , or not to be , i there 's the point " .
the 21 plays featured on the website include many of shakespeare 's best known works including king lear , a midsummer night 's dream , hamlet , love 's labours lost , romeo and juliet and othello .
accompanying the online collection is background material , essays by shakespearean scholars , commentaries , images and sound clips .
tools on the site allow scholars to compare different versions of the same play to track textual changes .

the latest claim of a wild beast roaming farmland is backed up with home video footage shot by a holidaymaker from the midlands .
it shows what appears to be a black cat-like creature creeping stealthily through undergrowth .
a welsh assembly government investigation concluded that the animal was just a domestic moggy , but big cat experts are keeping an open mind .
nevertheless , the holidaymaker who captured the pictures on tape is convinced his recording illustrates something other than a domestic cat .
david bacon and his family , from wolverhampton , were holidaying in foel , near welshpool , when he made the discovery .
we 're convinced it was a big cat and definitely not a large tom cat david bacon " i take a keen interest in wildlife and i 'm always peering through binoculars at things when i 'm in wales , " he said .
" but on this occasion i spotted something that looked like a big cat .
" my first instinct was that the creature was a panther because it was so black .
" we were just 600 yards away from it and there 's no way it was just a large domestic moggy .
the cat was walking through some bracken and undergrowth .
" my son suggested it was a puma but it was too black for a puma .
" my other son ran across to us with higher strength binoculars and he thought it was a big cat too . "
mr bacon added : " i did manage to get a shot of the cat although it was only 10 seconds long , " he said .
" we 're convinced it was a big cat and definitely not a large tom cat .
experts believe it could have been a panther " locals in the village said they 'd never seen anything suspicious before and a farmer came to see us to get more information .
" i took a copy of the video and handed it to welshpool police , and i contacted a wildlife expert from the welsh assembly who seemed very interested . "
the film shows a black figure moving through the undergrowth .
the footage is shaky , as mr bacon was trying to zoom in on the subject and focus the camera .
welsh assembly wildlife experts have since visited the site with mr bacon .
sergeant darren brown of dyfed-powys police in welshpool said he had made inquiries too .
" we contacted the rspca 's officer in mid wales who said he had heard nothing about injuries to stock in the area .
" we contacted a farmer who worked on a scheme called farm watch and he had n't received any reports of sightings of details about mauled stock . "
film comparison a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " officials from the assembly government have visited the site and taken video footage of a colleague standing at the same location where the video was taken .
" the same camera was used and it was taken at the same zoom and from the same position as the original video .
" a comparison of a single frame from the original video and a single frame of the video of a colleague clearly shows that the animal is the same size as a domestic cat . "
fears of wild big cats such as pumas and panthers roaming mid wales have circulated since the 1970s with sightings of the so-called ' beast of bont ' in north ceredigion .
last year , an expert was called in to investigate a suspected big cat attack on a welsh lamb at talsarn , near lampeter .
the welsh assembly government takes sightings seriously chris moiser of the british big cats ' society said it was possible mr bacon did spot a panther and he believes some may live wild in remote parts britain , after changes to laws restricting people keeping wild animals .
" you get three types of people who see these animals - attention seekers , the genuinely mistaken , and those who see what they think is a big cat , " he added .
" most people think that before the introduction of the dangerous wild animals act of 1976 most people released big cats they 'd kept as pets .
" but that does n't explain the sightings of big cats in the 1960s in part of somerset and surrey . "
mr moiser added : " from mr bacon 's description , the prime candidate is a black panther .
" they will eat whatever they feel like such as rabbit or deer and they will go for sheep if they take their fancy .
" large adult males can roam up to 40 miles a night to visit females , but they will normally roam 25 miles at night . "

the footage is shaky , as mr bacon was trying to zoom in on the subject and focus the camera .
welsh assembly wildlife experts have since visited the site with mr bacon .
sergeant darren brown of dyfed-powys police in welshpool said he had made inquiries too .
" we contacted the rspca 's officer in mid wales who said he had heard nothing about injuries to stock in the area .
" we contacted a farmer who worked on a scheme called farm watch and he had n't received any reports of sightings of details about mauled stock . "
film comparison a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " officials from the assembly government have visited the site and taken video footage of a colleague standing at the same location where the video was taken .
" the same camera was used and it was taken at the same zoom and from the same position as the original video .
" a comparison of a single frame from the original video and a single frame of the video of a colleague clearly shows that the animal is the same size as a domestic cat . "
fears of wild big cats such as pumas and panthers roaming mid wales have circulated since the 1970s with sightings of the so-called ' beast of bont ' in north ceredigion .
last year , an expert was called in to investigate a suspected big cat attack on a welsh lamb at talsarn , near lampeter .
the welsh assembly government takes sightings seriously chris moiser of the british big cats ' society said it was possible mr bacon did spot a panther and he believes some may live wild in remote parts britain , after changes to laws restricting people keeping wild animals .
" you get three types of people who see these animals - attention seekers , the genuinely mistaken , and those who see what they think is a big cat , " he added .
" most people think that before the introduction of the dangerous wild animals act of 1976 most people released big cats they 'd kept as pets .
" but that does n't explain the sightings of big cats in the 1960s in part of somerset and surrey . "
mr moiser added : " from mr bacon 's description , the prime candidate is a black panther .
" they will eat whatever they feel like such as rabbit or deer and they will go for sheep if they take their fancy .
" large adult males can roam up to 40 miles a night to visit females , but they will normally roam 25 miles at night . "

for many people , the uk 's 60m common -lrb- or norwegian -rrb- rats inspire a unique hatred and the immediate response to any trace of their presence are trays of vividly coloured poison .
but these " rodenticides " are becoming less effective and their impact on the wider environment increasingly regarded as unacceptable .
now more sophisticated methods are being pioneered to understand how rats live , breed and can be controlled .
mark lambert , from the central science laboratory , said the present methods of control leave a lot to be desired .
using traditional rodenticides is cheap and easy but not necessarily the most effective thing to do .

formidable enemy " rats are great opportunists and breed phenomenally fast " mark lambert , central science laboratory " if you keep putting down poison , it will eventually get into the environment and into the food chain , endangering other species .
" and there is also the classic problem of rats becoming resistant to the poison . "
mr lambert said individual rats do not develop resistance but are either born with it or not .
with extended exposure to poison , resistant rats breed while others die off , leaving a resistant population .
" so to tackle this , we went back to basics .
rats are great opportunists and breed phenomenally fast .
so why is n't everywhere overrun with them ?
why are some places still relatively rat free ?
" once we had an idea why rats favour some places and not others , we could replicate an environment which the rats did n't like . "
mr lambert began to concentrate his attention on farms .

growing problem these borders also have other environmental benefits , creating buffer zones to absorb pesticide run-off , and attracting rat predators such as the barn owl .
mr lambert also found that to avoid predators , rats tend to avoid open spaces whilst on the move .
removing cover around farm buildings , by clearing debris , machinery and stockpiled materials , led to reduced rat activity and survival .
professor robert smith from the university of leicester and chair of the rodenticide resistance action group , said : " resistance to rodenticides has again emerged as a problem in some parts of england .

" mark 's research has shown that good housekeeping by farmers pays dividends in keeping rats down , which is good for both the farmer and consumers of food produced by british farmers . "
a survey found significant traces of rat poison in over 60 % of the rare red kites and about 40 % of barn owls .
hygiene firm rentokil has pledged to reduce its use of traditional rat poisons by 75 % .
tony stephens , a biologist at rentokil , said : " our advice is that prevention is better than cure .
