the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .

the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .

sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .

in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson .

he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .

the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .

ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq .
-lrb- apr.13 , 2004 -rrb- aid organizations jittery as fighting , kidnappings shake iraq the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

"
in a seemingly impossible quest to cleanse the minds of their fellow students , a group of freiburg scholars are clamping down on those who access internet porn sites at their university . the computers in the general access room at the university of freiburg come with a health warning of sorts .
pictograms on the computers , which show two copulating matchstick figures which a line through the middle , send out a single , stark message : " view porn here and you are history . " the new warnings are the brainchild of the school 's students ' committee , which has started a campaign to fight the flood of erotic internet sites interfering with the academic lives of their contemporaries . the signs were put up to show that the use " of pornographic sites is forbidden and that the board of directors reserves the right to see the user 's transcript in future . "
in short , those surfing for smut on computers with the " no porn " signs could be exposed by university chaperones who will be checking which sites have been accessed and by whom . in a further bid to stop the so-called non-academic searches , the student representatives are also looking into the possibility of using filter software , perhaps believing that the urge to view porn on campus may not be dampened by a few threatening signs . " we want to examine what is technically feasible without simply closing everything down which contains the word ' sex , " ' said mark weinrich , a member of the students ' committee board of directors . stud is short for student however , this has proved to be problematic in the past .
students at the university of hanover recently found out that their electronic correspondence with american colleges was getting stymied .
it turned out that the institutions in the united states had very strict sex filters on their computers and the e-mail addresses of the hanover students were being picked off by the sharp-eyed electronic nannies .
the problem was that all the email addresses followed the same pattern : name @ stud.uni-hannover.de.
perceiving the inclusion of " stud " to mean " randy stallion " instead of an abbreviation of " student , " the u.s. filters believed they were stopping hardcore material coming their way . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge .

over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

"
in a seemingly impossible quest to cleanse the minds of their fellow students , a group of freiburg scholars are clamping down on those who access internet porn sites at their university . the computers in the general access room at the university of freiburg come with a health warning of sorts .
pictograms on the computers , which show two copulating matchstick figures which a line through the middle , send out a single , stark message : " view porn here and you are history . " the new warnings are the brainchild of the school 's students ' committee , which has started a campaign to fight the flood of erotic internet sites interfering with the academic lives of their contemporaries . the signs were put up to show that the use " of pornographic sites is forbidden and that the board of directors reserves the right to see the user 's transcript in future . "
in short , those surfing for smut on computers with the " no porn " signs could be exposed by university chaperones who will be checking which sites have been accessed and by whom . in a further bid to stop the so-called non-academic searches , the student representatives are also looking into the possibility of using filter software , perhaps believing that the urge to view porn on campus may not be dampened by a few threatening signs . " we want to examine what is technically feasible without simply closing everything down which contains the word ' sex , " ' said mark weinrich , a member of the students ' committee board of directors . stud is short for student however , this has proved to be problematic in the past .
students at the university of hanover recently found out that their electronic correspondence with american colleges was getting stymied .
it turned out that the institutions in the united states had very strict sex filters on their computers and the e-mail addresses of the hanover students were being picked off by the sharp-eyed electronic nannies .
the problem was that all the email addresses followed the same pattern : name @ stud.uni-hannover.de.
perceiving the inclusion of " stud " to mean " randy stallion " instead of an abbreviation of " student , " the u.s. filters believed they were stopping hardcore material coming their way . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .

the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .

the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

"
in a seemingly impossible quest to cleanse the minds of their fellow students , a group of freiburg scholars are clamping down on those who access internet porn sites at their university . the computers in the general access room at the university of freiburg come with a health warning of sorts .
pictograms on the computers , which show two copulating matchstick figures which a line through the middle , send out a single , stark message : " view porn here and you are history . " the new warnings are the brainchild of the school 's students ' committee , which has started a campaign to fight the flood of erotic internet sites interfering with the academic lives of their contemporaries . the signs were put up to show that the use " of pornographic sites is forbidden and that the board of directors reserves the right to see the user 's transcript in future . "
in short , those surfing for smut on computers with the " no porn " signs could be exposed by university chaperones who will be checking which sites have been accessed and by whom . in a further bid to stop the so-called non-academic searches , the student representatives are also looking into the possibility of using filter software , perhaps believing that the urge to view porn on campus may not be dampened by a few threatening signs . " we want to examine what is technically feasible without simply closing everything down which contains the word ' sex , " ' said mark weinrich , a member of the students ' committee board of directors . stud is short for student however , this has proved to be problematic in the past .
students at the university of hanover recently found out that their electronic correspondence with american colleges was getting stymied .
it turned out that the institutions in the united states had very strict sex filters on their computers and the e-mail addresses of the hanover students were being picked off by the sharp-eyed electronic nannies .
the problem was that all the email addresses followed the same pattern : name @ stud.uni-hannover.de.
perceiving the inclusion of " stud " to mean " randy stallion " instead of an abbreviation of " student , " the u.s. filters believed they were stopping hardcore material coming their way . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2004 german general : americans losing credibility in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insurgents of falluja with no end in sight to the recent escalation in violence between iraqi insurgents and coalition forces , deutsche welle spoke to german army gen. klaus reinhardt about the prospects for peace in iraq . the violent clashes that erupted across iraq in recent days have been the worst since combat operations officially ended in may .
but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

"
in a seemingly impossible quest to cleanse the minds of their fellow students , a group of freiburg scholars are clamping down on those who access internet porn sites at their university . the computers in the general access room at the university of freiburg come with a health warning of sorts .
pictograms on the computers , which show two copulating matchstick figures which a line through the middle , send out a single , stark message : " view porn here and you are history . " the new warnings are the brainchild of the school 's students ' committee , which has started a campaign to fight the flood of erotic internet sites interfering with the academic lives of their contemporaries . the signs were put up to show that the use " of pornographic sites is forbidden and that the board of directors reserves the right to see the user 's transcript in future . "
in short , those surfing for smut on computers with the " no porn " signs could be exposed by university chaperones who will be checking which sites have been accessed and by whom . in a further bid to stop the so-called non-academic searches , the student representatives are also looking into the possibility of using filter software , perhaps believing that the urge to view porn on campus may not be dampened by a few threatening signs . " we want to examine what is technically feasible without simply closing everything down which contains the word ' sex , " ' said mark weinrich , a member of the students ' committee board of directors . stud is short for student however , this has proved to be problematic in the past .
students at the university of hanover recently found out that their electronic correspondence with american colleges was getting stymied .
it turned out that the institutions in the united states had very strict sex filters on their computers and the e-mail addresses of the hanover students were being picked off by the sharp-eyed electronic nannies .
the problem was that all the email addresses followed the same pattern : name @ stud.uni-hannover.de.
perceiving the inclusion of " stud " to mean " randy stallion " instead of an abbreviation of " student , " the u.s. filters believed they were stopping hardcore material coming their way . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .
most of the candidates from the new member countries are expected to get a full five-year term on the next european commission . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de candidates for eu commission put to the test european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .

organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved .

" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .

in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke .

" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .
most of the candidates from the new member countries are expected to get a full five-year term on the next european commission . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de candidates for eu commission put to the test european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level .

he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq .

but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

but a rash of foreign kidnappings , which have been an effective method for iraqi resistance fighters to put pressure on the united states-led occupying forces , are proving even more troublesome .
about 40 hostages from 12 countries are reportedly being held ; and there has been no further news about two german security agents who are believed to be dead .
despite the coalition troops ' failure to stamp out the insurgency , u.s. president george w. bush insists washington will stay the course in iraq , and even send more troops if needed .
in a prime-time news conference on tuesday , bush repeated his conviction that the invasion was the right decision .
but he remained vague on the question of who will assume power when the coalition forces transfer sovereignty to the iraqis on june 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general klaus reinhardt .
given these developments , german army gen. klaus reinhardt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former commander of the nato-led kosovo force kfor , is pessimistic about the prospects for peace and stability in iraq .
deutsche welle spoke with reinhardt about the latest uprising against the occupying powers in iraq , and what , if anything , the u.s. can do to regain the support of the iraqi people . in iraq , we 're seeing daily attacks on the occupying powers and their supporters and now the frequent hostage takings - what kind of war has this become for the us and its allies ? it 's become a proper guerrilla war , and the insurgents have resorted to the simplest of methods , namely hostage-taking , to put political pressure on the allies to remove the occupying forces .
it 's a very difficult situation , because when hostages are involved the question always arises , what should one do to free them ?
and the political pressure on the u.s. has massively increased because of this strategy .
in addition to this , in falluja , we have the sunnis , as well as the forces for radical shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr , who are fighting against the americans .
so there 's a multi-faceted uprising against the u.s. , and now the americans have to use all the means at their disposal - particularly political means - to somehow get the population in iraq behind them again . does that mean that you do n't see any further military means by which the u.s. could get the conflict back under control ? military force could certainly be used to dampen the conflict , but it wo n't bring about any sort of lasting peace or order in the country because violence only fosters counter-violence .
we see this in falluja at the moment .
the americans started an operation to avenge the deaths of the four murdered u.s. soldiers , and this action caused considerable losses on both sides , as well as among the civilian population .
that has brought about renewed resistance there .
we also see that the shiites and sunnis are trying to band together against the americans under the motto that they are first and foremost iraqis and muslims and , secondly , sunnis and shiites .
and this could very quickly lead to the start of a fundamental uprising . the u.s. has obviously underestimated the amount of resistance to an occupying power in iraq .
in your opinion , was this development to be expected ?
what have the americans done wrong ? in the decisive time directly after the war ended , when the wave of plundering and murdering began , the americans put the basic requirements of the civilian population in question .
it was during this time that the waterworks , the power networks and many schools , for example , were destroyed .
and that 's when the americans basically lost the trust of the iraqi people , who were hoping that life would get better after saddam hussein .
as long as the americans are n't able to improve conditions for the iraqis , as long as they are unable to change how they are perceived from occupier to friends committed to helping iraq over the long term , then it seems to me that the americans have lost their credibility . could the difficulties also lie in the fact that the u.s. has very little experience as an occupying power compared with , for example , britain ? well , the u.s. performed the role of occupier very well in germany after world war ii , but after that , they seemed to always rely very heavily on military strength to overpower the populations in countries they 'd invaded , and with violence , they 've only ever had limited success .
particularly in muslim countries where the clan structures are very strong , where clans have traditionally been responsible for avenging the deaths of their members , the u.s. has used military force .
in doing so , it has created a basic perception in those populations of the americans as occupiers , and that 's always a negative perception . you 've said that the best chance now lies in political dialogue , but have the americans through their use of military force lost all credibility when it comes to a political solution ? i think the dialogue has to be led with those people who are supposed to have a say in the future of iraq .
the americans want to hand over power to iraq 's governing council , but the question is firstly , do they have the right people on the council , and secondly , should n't those people who are supposed to take over iraq 's political leadership as of july already be more strongly involved in matters so that they could encourage their fellow iraqis to abandon violence and distance themselves from those who are carrying out violent acts . interview conducted by anke hagedorn -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advises citizens to leave iraq the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq .
-lrb- apr.13 , 2004 -rrb- aid organizations jittery as fighting , kidnappings shake iraq the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

all are expected to be confirmed , but parliamentarians have n't shied away from candidates ' communist pasts . the three days of hearings before the european parliament are largely ceremonial for the 10 new eu commissioners , who are all expected to be sworn in early next month .
but that has n't stopped some parliamentarians from opening the line of questioning to include the political pasts of some new commissioners . czech candidate , pavel telicka , was the first candidate to face such questioning before the parliament on wednesday after the issue of his communist past was raised by a british conservative member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caroline jackson . " i think we need to grapple with this , " jackson said , asking telicka to explain when he joined the party and when he " saw the light , as it were . " " right to make mistakes " telicka complied , explaining that he joined in 1988 when he was a lawyer working at the then-czechoslovak ministry of foreign affairs .
he quit the party after the collapse of communism a year later . " one has a right to make mistakes , " he said .
" what is also important is what comes afterward . "
he said he no longer belongs to any political party , adding that he believes in " individual freedom , private ownership , social security and solidarity , not just at -lrb- the eu -rrb- level . " during the hearing , spanish socialist mep manuel medina ortega criticized jackson 's questions , saying they were inappropriate .
he said that the conservative block in the eu parliament included spanish mep 's who 'd had ties to fascist regime of the late spanish general francisco franco . " nobody has ever put questions of this kind to them about their political past , " ortega said , calling for " respect to be accorded to people who have had to live through very difficult circumstances . " shadow role initially the hearings began on tuesday with candidates from latvia , hungary and malta , and will conclude on thursday with estonian candidate , siim kallas , who may also face similar questions about his political record . when the candidates take up their posts in may , they 'll be without specific assignments for the first six months .
instead , they 'll shadow existing members of the eu executive to get an introduction in european affairs . the current 20-member european commission 's tenure expires in october , after which a new 25-member executive will be named .

the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing . it all began 15 years ago in 1989 , when 150 techno fans danced down berlin 's kurfürstendamm , propelled by the music 's driving beat and , likely , illegal substances coursing through the veins of some .
by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled . " with much regret , we announce that this year there will definitely be no love parade , " the organizers said , adding that a lack of a financing plan left them no option but to cancel the event . money troubles the company behind the event , the love parade gmbh , had hoped to work in 2004 with messe berlin , a firm which organizes many of the trade fairs , exhibitions and conferences that take place in the capital .
in 2003 , messe berlin catered the party and in return agreed to take care of cleaning up afterwards .
the deal , however , lost the company some € 500,000 -lrb- $ 596,000 -rrb- and it has said it is not interested in taking part in 2004 . according to the organizers , negotiations with the city government to find other partners to provide financing have failed .
the government of berlin has refused to make up for any deficits that the event comes away with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ravers dance in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during the annual love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
the parade has also lost some of its luster since its heyday and visitors numbers have been declining .
last year around 500,000 people participated , only a third of the numbers from 1999 .
sales of the cd from the event , an important funding source , have slumped while the search for sponsors has become increasingly difficult . parade costs have risen dramatically since 2001 , when organizers first had to cover expenses associated with the event after it lost its status as a political demonstration that year .
organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved . " we 've tried to do all we can from our side , " she said .
" but the event can not be subsidized forever . " opposition politicians called on the city to keep the party alive .
kai wegner , economics spokesman of the conservative christian democrats , said the love parade was one of " berlin 's top events " that attracts young people to the city .
the liberal party called on berlin mayor klaus wowereit to make the love parade his top priority , saying it provides an important economic boost to the retail , restaurant and hospitality sectors . the demise of the parade has been announced several times before , some point out , and it has still gone ahead .
over the last few years , last-minute financing deals have been hammered out . techno past its prime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj dr. motte alias matthias roeingh .
the love parade was founded by a techno dj who goes by the name dr. motte -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 1989 , the 150 fans who gathered to dance and party did so under the motto " peace , joy and pancakes . "
ten years later the event broke all records with 1.5 million visitors and since 2000 , love parades have taken place in vienna , tel aviv and mexico city . the slow demise of the love parade coincides with the decline in popularity of techno music itself . very popular in the 1990s , the music with its driving beats and repetitive rhythms began to lose steam as the new millennium broke . " young people have turned back to rock and pop , " ronald hitzler , a sociologist at the university of dortmund , told german press agency dpa .
" many are asking the question , ' when is the techno revival going to come ? " ' for berlin 's love parade , the revival , if it does come , might come too late .
according to hitzler , that would be a " bad sign for the capital . "
he said rather than just a simple rave party , the parade is more like a summer carnival with a techno edge . " it has a lot to do with a zest for life , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

by 1999 , the numbers had swollen to 1.5 million and the avenue between berlin 's victory column and the brandenburg gate was turned into one large dance floor . but in 2004 , it looks like the party might be over and the dj 's going home .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the event 's organizers said this year 's parade , scheduled for july 10 , has been cancelled .

organizers say costs rose from € 300,000 in 2001 to € 1.23 million in 2003 .
a large portion of that expense comes from costs incurred cleaning up along the parade route after partygoers leave . government surprised berlin 's city government reacted with surprise at wednesday 's cancellation announcement .
a spokeswoman for the city 's economics minister , harald wolf , told reporters that a meeting planned for friday with parade organizers to discuss financing issues was still on the schedule , saying it was still an open question whether the event could be saved .

further progress in this field would be very helpful in the context of discussions that are ongoing on the possibility of lifting the arms embargo . "
his comments came after a after meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao .
the eu put the ban in place in the aftermath of the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
moves to lift the embargo , strongly backed by france , have concerned the u.s. , which fears that more arms in the region may topple the delicate balance of power which keeps taiwan and china at relative peace .
the uk is also reported to have stepped up its opposition to lifting this ban .

"
in a seemingly impossible quest to cleanse the minds of their fellow students , a group of freiburg scholars are clamping down on those who access internet porn sites at their university . the computers in the general access room at the university of freiburg come with a health warning of sorts .
pictograms on the computers , which show two copulating matchstick figures which a line through the middle , send out a single , stark message : " view porn here and you are history . " the new warnings are the brainchild of the school 's students ' committee , which has started a campaign to fight the flood of erotic internet sites interfering with the academic lives of their contemporaries . the signs were put up to show that the use " of pornographic sites is forbidden and that the board of directors reserves the right to see the user 's transcript in future . "
in short , those surfing for smut on computers with the " no porn " signs could be exposed by university chaperones who will be checking which sites have been accessed and by whom . in a further bid to stop the so-called non-academic searches , the student representatives are also looking into the possibility of using filter software , perhaps believing that the urge to view porn on campus may not be dampened by a few threatening signs . " we want to examine what is technically feasible without simply closing everything down which contains the word ' sex , " ' said mark weinrich , a member of the students ' committee board of directors . stud is short for student however , this has proved to be problematic in the past .
students at the university of hanover recently found out that their electronic correspondence with american colleges was getting stymied .
it turned out that the institutions in the united states had very strict sex filters on their computers and the e-mail addresses of the hanover students were being picked off by the sharp-eyed electronic nannies .
the problem was that all the email addresses followed the same pattern : name @ stud.uni-hannover.de.
perceiving the inclusion of " stud " to mean " randy stallion " instead of an abbreviation of " student , " the u.s. filters believed they were stopping hardcore material coming their way . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

meanwhile , a detective has been taken off the inquiry for using a racially offensive word .
dna evidence officers are travelling to china on wednesday to try to confirm the identities of all the dead .
eight detectives from lancashire police are going to the fujian province to find out if three more could have died .
the officers are due to speak to relatives of all the victims and plan to collect dna evidence during the trip .
a police spokeswoman said : " there are three missing people whose families in china have said they think they were at morecambe bay .
racial slur " these people have not been in touch with their families since the tragedy .
" it 's quite possible that there are three more bodies , but it might be that they were not at morecambe on that night . "
on tuesday it emerged detective constable neil thompson had been removed from the inquiry for using an offensive racial word .
he has been given a formal written warning after using the slur during an interview with a then suspect in the case .
bail extended a lancashire police spokesman said : " this is extremely demeaning for any officer , particularly when the case is one of such high profile national interest and concern . "
inquiries into the tragedy are expected to take a further two to three months .
two people arrested over the deaths of the cockle pickers had all charges against them dropped on tuesday .
a further six arrested in connection with the tragedy have had their bail extended by lancashire police .

the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- was asked to look into claims by the company that flights were available for as little as 50 pence .
although the company said flights at that price were subject to availability the authority upheld the complaint .
an invitation to fly from edinburgh to exeter for a winter treat was also found to be misleading because the flights did not start until april .
complaints about flybe 's advertising came from throughout the uk .
after seeing an advert for flights for 50 pence from the likes of edinburgh and southampton , one man said he spent hours trying to get one but failed .
another offer for free flights on certain routes was found to be misleading because taxes were not included .
the asa ruling stated : " the authority told the advertisers not to describe flights as ' free ' in future unless they could prove no taxes or charges were passed on to consumers . "
over the last 12 months the exeter-based operator has had six complaints upheld against it .

they will take dna samples from the relatives of the 20 cocklers who are known to have died .
they will also interview the families of three other people , who , it is feared , may also have drowned .
the cocklers died when they were caught in fast incoming tides off hest bank on the bay .
charges dropped detective chief inspector steve brunskill , in charge of the two-week trip to china , said : " we now believe we know the names of all 20 of the victims but we need to travel to china in order to obtain dna evidence that will confirm the identities .
" at this time , there are still three outstanding missing persons who were believed by their families to be cockle pickers at morecambe , and have not been in contact since the tragedy .
" we will have a clearer picture about this after the work in china has been completed . "
inquiries are expected to take a further two to three months .
two people arrested over the deaths of the cockle pickers had all charges against them dropped on tuesday .
a further six arrested in connection with the tragedy have had their bail extended by lancashire police .
four of these six are no longer suspected of manslaughter and are being questioned over immigration offences .

according to the cardiff chamber , 60 % of firms recruited in the last quarter but more than two thirds had difficulty filling vacancies .
despite this , the new report found that business confidence was high in wales .
in 2004 , it said export sales have also risen in both the service sector and manufacturing .
but helen conway , chief executive of the cardiff chamber of commerce , said employers were " having difficulty " filling vacancies .
" the shortage is across the board , " she said .
" retail , tourism and construction have had difficulties for some considerable time .
" we are very close to full employment in south wales and we do n't have the numbers coming through .
" this points to a simple choice for the assembly government when it reviews its priorities , " she added .
" inactivity levels are also high , so there is a real need for the assembly government to bring forward a strategy to bring people back to work .
" the opportunities exist .
we just need the right encouragement for people to take up the vacancies . "
but despite the labour shortage , the chambers claim that businesses in wales remain confident that they will improve turnover , particularly in the service sector .

a businessman wants to use a 3,000 square foot industrial unit in saltash to get youngsters off the streets and reduce complaints about noise .
but there are concerns the proposed unit only has six parking spaces .
nick marker , who wants to convert the unit , says it will be enough because most youngsters will be dropped off and collected by their parents .
it 's especially needed in the winter lucas brammall if it gets the go-ahead , the park on the moorland trading estate would be the second in the county .
the other is at mount hawke near truro .
nick marker , who ran a similar venture in plymouth , said the supervision would be good for the young people .
he said : " we just see them out on the streets , they 've nowhere to go and we see a lot dip out of these sports and start going down a rougher road .
we do n't want to see that . "
but when councillors recently visited the unit to discuss planning issues , one of them , steve tait , also expressed concerns about youngsters ' safety while walking to and from the site .
he said : " industrial estates by their very nature are busy with lorries and the like .
they are used 24 hours a day , so you ca n't say there 's ever going to be a quiet time for them to use it . "
nick marker said he had a survey carried out which showed only 12 % of people going to and from the unit would have vehicles , which would mean no more than four cars using spaces at a time .
skateboarder lucas brammall , 16 , said a skate park is desperately needed in the area .
he said : " it 's especially needed in the winter , when it 's raining , or when other places are too crowded or just unskateable . "
a decision on a planning application to change the use of the unit from light industrial to leisure will be made next month .

the clinical and experimental allergy report calls for more allergy specialists to meet increased demand .
experts at the universities of edinburgh and aberdeen say levels of asthma , eczema and hay fever have risen significantly since the 1950s .
the report warns a lack of specialist care may see sufferers seek herbalist or homeopathic treatment .
the uk has one of the highest rates of allergies in the world and scotland has more teenage asthma sufferers than any other country .
one in five british children and adults suffers from asthma , eczema and other allergic conditions .
although rates of asthma have levelled out , other allergies such as those connected with food are increasing rapidly .
the authors of the report have issued a call for an urgent review of specialist allergy care provision .
they claim britain is unusual in using gps to manage allergic disorders and that a lack of specialised care may be sending many sufferers outside the nhs to herbalists and homeopathic practitioners .

drivers are being asked to avoid the redheugh bridge as the £ 1.5m programme of major work gets underway .
the bridge on the a189 will be down to a single lane in each direction for six months , starting on 16 may .
engineers have timed the work to take advantage of lighter traffic and longer days enabling work to start earlier in the day and continue into the evening .
inspections have shown that the bridge 's waterproof membrane needs to be replaced .
the membrane lies beneath the surface of the road and prevents rain water and salt from damaging the main bridge structure .
the original waterproof membrane was designed to last 20 years and has now come to the end of its life .
it will be replaced by a new material which is designed to last for 40 years .
' alternative routes ' gateshead council 's director of development and enterprise john robinson said the work was unavoidable .
he said : " if we do n't replace the waterproof membrane on the bridge 's concrete deck , then rainwater and salt will play havoc with the main structure of the bridge .
" the result of that will be much longer , and much more expensive , repairs .
" doing nothing is simply not an option .
road bridges are like the cars that use them - they both eventually fall to pieces if you do n't maintain them . "
engineers will also be renewing the bridge 's expansion joints , in the first major repairs to be carried out on the redheugh bridge since it opened in 1983 .
mr robinson said : " all we can do is to appeal to drivers to be patient or use alternative routes . "

since oil was discovered on the norwegian continental shelf in 1971 , this small nation has been propelled into the world 's third largest oil and gas exporter , and petroleum activities contribute 20 % of the gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
but now forecasts suggest the country 's economic mainstay has started its inevitable decline .
the oil and energy minister , einar stensnaes , told bbc news online it was time to start looking at the alternatives .
" not only is it essential to look for other energy sources .
it is also important to look for other industrial activities to develop alongside the petroleum activity , " he said .
click to see where the world 's oil is estimates say one third of the total petroleum resources on the norwegian continental shelf are still unexploited .
the government works on the assumption there are another 50 years left of oil there .
it is not sure , however , that all the resources are exploitable .
new areas , bigger challenges norway 's biggest potential finds are no longer in the north sea , where oil companies are well established and have very good resources and knowledge of how to get the oil and gas to the surface .
hydro executive torvund is searching for alternatives to oil " the undeveloped areas in the -lsb- far north arctic -rsb- barents sea are very promising , but more challenging in many ways , " said the director general of the norwegian petroleum directorate , gunnar berge .
his directorate has advised the government that it must expand the search for oil and gas to the barents sea , and late last year the government announced it would allow drilling for oil and gas there .
this provoked fierce criticism from environmental organisations which argued the fragile nature of the arctic would not withstand any potential oil leaks .
many here say the oil and energy minister has been caught between a rock and a hard place on this question .
" we must secure new acreage , and the most promising areas are in the far north , " said mr stensnaes .
" but this also coincides with the very important fishing areas in norway , and the population in this area is heavily dependent on fishing . "
drilling in the arctic is extremely expensive and difficult because of the often fierce weather conditions .
and there is also a significant political dilemma still to be resolved .
both norway and russia are laying claims to an area of the barents sea that is bigger than the north sea and is thought to contain even more oil and gas .
gas on the up while norway 's oil production seems to have started its inevitable decline , gas production is on the increase .

since oil was discovered on the norwegian continental shelf in 1971 , this small nation has been propelled into the world 's third largest oil and gas exporter , and petroleum activities contribute 20 % of the gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
but now forecasts suggest the country 's economic mainstay has started its inevitable decline .
the oil and energy minister , einar stensnaes , told bbc news online it was time to start looking at the alternatives .
" not only is it essential to look for other energy sources .
it is also important to look for other industrial activities to develop alongside the petroleum activity , " he said .
estimates say one third of the total petroleum resources on the norwegian continental shelf are still unexploited .
the government works on the assumption there are another 50 years left of oil there .
it is not sure , however , that all the resources are exploitable .
new areas , bigger challenges norway 's biggest potential finds are no longer in the north sea , where oil companies are well established and have very good resources and knowledge of how to get the oil and gas to the surface .
" the undeveloped areas in the -lsb- far north arctic -rsb- barents sea are very promising , but more challenging in many ways , " said the director general of the norwegian petroleum directorate , gunnar berge .
his directorate has advised the government that it must expand the search for oil and gas to the barents sea , and late last year the government announced it would allow drilling for oil and gas there .
this provoked fierce criticism from environmental organisations which argued the fragile nature of the arctic would not withstand any potential oil leaks .
many here say the oil and energy minister has been caught between a rock and a hard place on this question .
" we must secure new acreage , and the most promising areas are in the far north , " said mr stensnaes .
" but this also coincides with the very important fishing areas in norway , and the population in this area is heavily dependent on fishing . "
drilling in the arctic is extremely expensive and difficult because of the often fierce weather conditions .
and there is also a significant political dilemma still to be resolved .
both norway and russia are laying claims to an area of the barents sea that is bigger than the north sea and is thought to contain even more oil and gas .
gas on the up while norway 's oil production seems to have started its inevitable decline , gas production is on the increase .
statoil is norway 's largest oil and gas producing company .
acting chief executive , erling oeverland , told bbc news online the company believes there is enough gas for another 100 years of profitable production .
" in five years time , we will be producing as much gas as oil from the norwegian continental shelf , " he said .
" after that , gas will be bigger than oil . "
norway is already the third largest exporter of gas to the rest of europe .
alternatives the production of oil and gas is not critical to cover the energy needs of norway itself .
most of this country 's 4,5 million people are largely served by cheap hydro electric energy .
but it is a great worry that the industry most crucial to this country 's wealth is terminal .
one company looking into future energy alternatives is hydro , norway 's second largest oil and gas producer .
" we 're presently making a small scale research project a small norwegian island where we take the wind , transform it into electricity and then transform that electricity into hydrogen , " said executive vice president tore torvund .
" when there is no wind , we can produce electricity based on hydrogen . "
mr torvund does not foresee making any profits from alternative energy sources for the next twenty to thirty years .
by then this country 's economic mainstay - oil -may well be fast running out .

the us president later joined in the defence of his administration 's role .
on wednesday , the heads of the fbi and cia will face the commission along with other senior intelligence officials .

john ashcroft said that policies adopted during the previous clinton presidency had severely handicapped intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
" the simple fact of september 11 is this : we did not know an attack was coming because for nearly a decade , our government had blinded itself to its enemies .
" the old national intelligence system in place on september 11 was destined to fail . "
mr ashcroft said he had recommended finding and killing al-qaeda leader osama bin laden after earlier attacks on us interests abroad .

" even if they could have penetrated bin laden 's training camps , they would have needed a battery of lawyers to approve the capture , " he said .

fbi ' hamstrung ' on tuesday , the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states published a preliminary report in which it accused the fbi of failing over several years to respond to the steadily growing threat of terrorism .
it said the fbi was hamstrung by poor intelligence , a failure to share information and insufficient resources .

the report also notes that mr ashcroft rejected an appeal for more funding a day before the attacks .
former fbi director louis freeh , who resigned in june 2001 , acknowledged to the commission that fbi counter-terrorism operations were severely under funded and understaffed .
appearing before the hearing , he said requests made in the three years to 2003 for 1,895 more staff - including arabic linguists - produced an increase of 76 posts , as terrorism was not then a national priority .

even if they could have penetrated bin laden 's training camps , they would have needed a battery of lawyers to approve the capture attorney general john ashcroft excerpts of testimony q & a : 9/11 commission earlier , the attorney general expressed sorrow and anger over the events , and said he would have deployed all available resources to prevent the attacks had he known they were coming .
john ashcroft said that policies adopted during the previous clinton presidency had severely handicapped intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
" the simple fact of september 11 is this : we did not know an attack was coming because for nearly a decade , our government had blinded itself to its enemies .
" the old national intelligence system in place on september 11 was destined to fail . "
mr ashcroft said he had recommended finding and killing al-qaeda leader osama bin laden after earlier attacks on us interests abroad .
he said he was supported by national security adviser condoleezza rice , but laws in place at the time hindered any such plan .
the criticism is good as long as it is constructive and it does n't become a witch hunt patrick , usa have your say mr ashcroft said a legal wall had been put in place to separate criminal investigators from intelligence agents .
" even if they could have penetrated bin laden 's training camps , they would have needed a battery of lawyers to approve the capture , " he said .
he said the passing of controversial national security legislation in the wake of 11 september , such as the patriot act , had removed such barriers to action .
fbi ' hamstrung ' on tuesday , the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states published a preliminary report in which it accused the fbi of failing over several years to respond to the steadily growing threat of terrorism .
it said the fbi was hamstrung by poor intelligence , a failure to share information and insufficient resources .
wednesday 's main witnesses cia director george tenet -lrb- second appearance -rrb- fbi director robert mueller the report claimed that 66 % of the fbi 's intelligence analysts were not qualified to do their job and that on the day of the attacks , about 1,300 agents - just 6 % of the fbi 's total personnel - worked on counter-terrorism .
the report also notes that mr ashcroft rejected an appeal for more funding a day before the attacks .
former fbi director louis freeh , who resigned in june 2001 , acknowledged to the commission that fbi counter-terrorism operations were severely under funded and understaffed .
appearing before the hearing , he said requests made in the three years to 2003 for 1,895 more staff - including arabic linguists - produced an increase of 76 posts , as terrorism was not then a national priority .

mr quattrone , whose original trial collapsed last october when the jury could not agree on a verdict , is again accused of obstructing a federal probe .
formerly of credit suisse first boston -lrb- cfsb -rrb- , he was alleged to have blocked investigations into how csfb allocated shares in hot internet stocks .
he is alleged to have asked staff to wipe e-mails about the firm 's actions .
prosecutors say that when he encouraged the clean-out , he already knew the investigation was under way .
the probe - which was later closed without criminal charges being filed - arose out of suspicions about how csfb decided who got to participate in hot technology flotations .
like many other investment banks , the firm was accused of offering potential clients the chance to take a slice of the initial offering - which would soar in value once the shares started trading - in exchange for more of their business .
' routine ' but mr quattrone 's lawyers contend that when he encouraged staff to obey instructions to " catch up on file cleaning " in december 2000 , he was simply following csfb 's usual policy of routinely destroying redundant documents .
they had earlier called unsuccessfully for the retrial to take place in mr quattrone 's native california .
it is unknown whether mr quattrone , who made as much as $ 120m a year at csfb , will take to the stand again in the retrial , after his performance was criticised as being too combative during the first hearing .
if found guilty , mr quattrone could face a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , though federal guidelines recommend a lighter sentence .
he resigned from csfb in march 2003 after being suspended when the allegations of e-mail shredding emerged .
