two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

" it was a very black day for me .
i noticed at the first mountain i did n't have good legs and i was cold on the downhill .
maybe i can still manage something , " ullrich said .
he had previously said he felt good about friday 's 12th stage . after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , ulllrich has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by us postal team captain armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . things did n't go any better for ullrich on saturday , when he lost two minutes and 41 seconds on armstrong .
ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .
as he struggled up the mountain , his helper andreas klöden powered to a third place finish on friday . " i would n't have a problem working as a helper .

ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .

“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

" it was a very black day for me .
i noticed at the first mountain i did n't have good legs and i was cold on the downhill .
maybe i can still manage something , " ullrich said .
he had previously said he felt good about friday 's 12th stage . after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , ulllrich has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by us postal team captain armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . things did n't go any better for ullrich on saturday , when he lost two minutes and 41 seconds on armstrong .
ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .
as he struggled up the mountain , his helper andreas klöden powered to a third place finish on friday . " i would n't have a problem working as a helper .
klöden is riding well and could a joker for the team , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong from the us is reflected in the mirror of a motorcycle as he rides during the 12th stage of the tour de france . but armstrong has not yet written off his german rival : " jan 's not finished .
he 's a tough guy who does n't give up .
he might have taken one on the chin but he always comes back and is strong in the last week . " still , armstrong now looks set to win a record sixth tour de france after another potential challenger , american tyler hamilton , pulled out of competition on saturday .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .

“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

" it was a very black day for me .
i noticed at the first mountain i did n't have good legs and i was cold on the downhill .
maybe i can still manage something , " ullrich said .
he had previously said he felt good about friday 's 12th stage . after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , ulllrich has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by us postal team captain armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . things did n't go any better for ullrich on saturday , when he lost two minutes and 41 seconds on armstrong .
ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .
as he struggled up the mountain , his helper andreas klöden powered to a third place finish on friday . " i would n't have a problem working as a helper .
klöden is riding well and could a joker for the team , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong from the us is reflected in the mirror of a motorcycle as he rides during the 12th stage of the tour de france . but armstrong has not yet written off his german rival : " jan 's not finished .
he 's a tough guy who does n't give up .
he might have taken one on the chin but he always comes back and is strong in the last week . " still , armstrong now looks set to win a record sixth tour de france after another potential challenger , american tyler hamilton , pulled out of competition on saturday .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .

far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .

fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .

but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .

in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .

" it was a very black day for me .
i noticed at the first mountain i did n't have good legs and i was cold on the downhill .
maybe i can still manage something , " ullrich said .
he had previously said he felt good about friday 's 12th stage . after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , ulllrich has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by us postal team captain armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . things did n't go any better for ullrich on saturday , when he lost two minutes and 41 seconds on armstrong .
ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .
as he struggled up the mountain , his helper andreas klöden powered to a third place finish on friday . " i would n't have a problem working as a helper .
klöden is riding well and could a joker for the team , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong from the us is reflected in the mirror of a motorcycle as he rides during the 12th stage of the tour de france . but armstrong has not yet written off his german rival : " jan 's not finished .
he 's a tough guy who does n't give up .
he might have taken one on the chin but he always comes back and is strong in the last week . " still , armstrong now looks set to win a record sixth tour de france after another potential challenger , american tyler hamilton , pulled out of competition on saturday .
hamilton suffered a back injury last week in a crash and like ullrich , he too was unable to keep up with armstrong 's punishing pace on friday . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ullrich aims to dethrone armstrong defending tour de france champion lance armstrong will attempt a record sixth win when the world 's greatest cycling event starts on saturday .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

" it was a very black day for me .
i noticed at the first mountain i did n't have good legs and i was cold on the downhill .
maybe i can still manage something , " ullrich said .
he had previously said he felt good about friday 's 12th stage . after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , ulllrich has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by us postal team captain armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . things did n't go any better for ullrich on saturday , when he lost two minutes and 41 seconds on armstrong .
ullrich is now over six minutes behind armstrong . ullrich 's woes have followed a familiar pattern over the years .
although he is considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation , he is often unable to dig deep and find the necessary strength when he needs it most .
whether he can find the motivation to beat armstrong this year remains to be seen , but whereas the texan exudes cool confidence , ullrich seems uncertain . only a helper ? perhaps most telling were ullrich 's comments on friday that he would support the strongest member of his t-mobile team if he did not have a chance to win the tour himself .
as he struggled up the mountain , his helper andreas klöden powered to a third place finish on friday . " i would n't have a problem working as a helper .
klöden is riding well and could a joker for the team , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong from the us is reflected in the mirror of a motorcycle as he rides during the 12th stage of the tour de france . but armstrong has not yet written off his german rival : " jan 's not finished .
he 's a tough guy who does n't give up .
he might have taken one on the chin but he always comes back and is strong in the last week . " still , armstrong now looks set to win a record sixth tour de france after another potential challenger , american tyler hamilton , pulled out of competition on saturday .
hamilton suffered a back injury last week in a crash and like ullrich , he too was unable to keep up with armstrong 's punishing pace on friday . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ullrich aims to dethrone armstrong defending tour de france champion lance armstrong will attempt a record sixth win when the world 's greatest cycling event starts on saturday .

two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital . shortly before 1989 , thomas mrozek was seriously thinking of leaving west berlin . the island of capitalism in the gdr had begun to sink in its own hype , becoming staid and boring to the costume designer , who had begun toying with the idea of starting his own fashion label . then the iron curtain collapsed and everything changed , not least in the city ’ s fashion scene . “ i think we were really lucky when the wall fell because the city became real , ” said mrozek , who today runs the women ’ s wear label thatcher ’ s with his partner ralf hansellek . the raw , creative energy that fused east and west berlin together sparked what today has become one of europe ’ s most exciting and innovative fashion scenes .
this weekend , the capital plays host to the premium and bread & butter fashion trade shows .
the arrival of the two prestigious shows firmly places berlin atop germany ’ s fashion hierarchy , something city officials are eager to take advantage of .
fashion is a business opportunity for berlin , ” tanja mühfans , who works in the berlin senate ’ s economics office , told the daily tagesspiegel .
“ we know that we have to do something now , because the window of opportunity will eventually close . ” dare yourself the city has become a magnet for young designers lured by the combination of cheap rents and a fashion-savvy populace . ” you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , ” said andrea hartwig , 24 , who two years ago started the label hartbo and l ´ wig with her partner sarah elbo .
“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

“ every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it ’ s contagious . ” the duo rented a storefront near kastanienallee , one of east berlin ’ s shopping miles , after graduating from esmod in 2002 .
the school is one of five that supplies the city with an annual crop of young designers .
within a few short years , hartwig and elbo have made a name for themselves , selling their women ’ s wear in paris , munich , berlin , zürich and salzburg . transvestites that inspire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread & butter modeshow in berlin “ every city says ‘ we are different , and innovative and original . ’
but berlin really is , ” elbo , 31 , a native of denmark who moved to the city in 1996 , told dw-world . designers say the mixture of blue-collar grit , capital city glamour and adventurousness infuses their work .
far from the refined chic and classic cuts of paris or london , the city offers designers a laboratory in which to experiment . when mrozek and hensellek first started designing clothes in their own apartments in the early 1990s , they drew their inspiration from the madness of the streets of berlin , from transvestites or from books they had read .
nowadays , mrozek told dw-world , “ it ’ s not so much the people in the streets , it ’ s the atmosphere of the city that ’ s in -lrb- our -rrb- work . ” don ’ t believe -lrb- all -rrb- the hype for all its creativity , the city is unlikely to join the ranks of paris , milan and london as world fashion capitals .
both berlin and the rest of germany is missing quality fashion publications run by people who follow developments in the country ’ s design scene and trumpet its achievements outside its borders .
in addition , the economy is in the dumps , and many berliners don ’ t have the spending capacity to sustain the many small labels . ” the people here don ’ t have € 500 in their pockets that they can spend without thinking about it for two days , ” said hartwig .
“ and that ’ s tough . ” east rising berlin ’ s fashion future might be tied to the european union ’ s recent expansion east .
countries like poland and the czech republic , just hours away from berlin , boast impressive economic growth rates and a post-iron curtain generation that is becoming increasingly affluent and fashion-conscious . “ when they become rich , the balance will change , and that is the big hope for berlin , ” said mrozek .
for now , the city will have to bask in the glow of the hype lavished upon it from an appreciative fashion world , hoping it evolves into something lasting , and profitable . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

the bank 's move is thought to be in response to a bbc documentary , which showed bnp members confessing to racially motivated crimes .
bnp chairman nick griffin claimed the action breached european human rights legislation .
" we have the right to hold political opinions and to impart them , " he said .
the bank has not confirmed the decision but the bnp 's john walker said he had received a call from the bank informing him that the accounts are to be closed .
mr walker said that he was unaware whether any other banks that hold party funds would follow suit .
but mr griffin said the party may find it difficult to open accounts with other banks .
he described the move by barclays as " absolutely scandalous " and an " attempt to ban it -lsb- the party -rsb- by the back door " .
he said a member of the party 's treasury department was informed about the freezing of their accounts on friday afternoon .
the legal position of the account closures will be studied , he added .
" if we can , we will take them -lsb- barclays -rsb- to the cleaners .
human rights " we do n't want to take them to the cleaners , all we want is the democratic right to access back accounts . "
he said : " barclays may find themselves up against european human rights legislation . "
mr griffin said the accounts contained thousands of pounds - " enough money to run a small but effective political party " .
the party must have a bank account in britain to comply with electoral commission regulations .
a barclays spokeswoman said the company would not comment because of client confidentiality .
however , a bank official said barclays would consider whether there was a " reputational risk " when it was deciding whether to open or close an account .
tapes reviewed in the secret agent documentary , footage recorded at a meeting in keighley shows mr griffin saying islam was a " vicious wicked faith " and warning the audience to " stand up " to muslims .
in an interview on bbc two 's newsnight programme following thursday 's broadcast of the documentary , mr griffin refused to say sorry for his comments and added the " islamification " of the west had partly happened by rape .
however , he did apologise for comments made by other bnp activists shown on the documentary confessing to race crimes .
three of them have been expelled from the party , mr griffin said .
reporter jason gwynne spent six months infiltrating the bnp 's west yorkshire branch with the help of a former local organiser .

the first night of the 110th season opened with music by bach , elgar and holst 's the planets .
chief conductor leonard slatkin said the annual eight-week event displayed " magic ... night in , night out " .
as well as the 6,000 audience members in the royal albert hall , the concerts will also be relayed on giant screens in london 's hyde park .
the first night featured the return of the uk 's biggest organ after a three-year £ 1.7m restoration project .
organist martin neary sounded the first note at the proms as he launched in to bach 's toccata and fugue in d minor .
eastern influence one of the themes for this year 's proms is the influence of chinese and eastern cultures on western music .
cellist yo yo ma and the silk road ensemble will be among the special guests during the event .
there will also be a celebration of english music , under the title england at the crossroads , marking 1934 - the year composers edward elgar died and sir peter maxwell davies was born .
the festival runs until 11 september , when the royal albert hall will once again ring out to the sounds of the traditional last night of the proms .
" there is nothing like this festival .
i think if you take any musician that walks on to that stage , they will tell they look forward for a whole year to coming here , " mr slatkin told bbc one 's breakfast .
" it 's the best audience in the world and the widest listening and viewing public .
there really is a magic that happens here night in , night out . "
the nation 's favourite event on saturday will feature the william tell overture , made famous by the lone ranger tv show , which was chosen by public vote .

" i love being a mum and i love living in a place where i am surrounded by like-minded people , and where music is everywhere - i just love that . "
" i am enjoying myself a lot out there . "
as for her memories of catatonia , she said she felt " proud of a lot of the songs " the band did .
" i am beginning to enjoy thinking about -lsb- the time in the band -rsb- now - we had some great times . "
catatonia had several major hits , including mulder and scully , road rage and an album track , international velvet , which became an unofficial welsh anthem with its chorus " every day when i wake up i thank the lord i 'm welsh " .

" i am speaking my own form of wenglish to her - welsh and english , and i am trying to teach her italian as well , " she said .
" she will probably be half-trilingual - not speaking any of them very well , just like me ! "
the dolgellau festival is a two-day event , featuring bands including meinir gwilym , kentucky afc and bryn fon .
cerys , who married to american music producer seth riddle after the break-up of catatonia , said the concert was an unmissable chance to play a live concert on home soil .
i love being a mum and i love living in a place where music is everywhere cerys matthews " it 's really good to be back in wales , " she said .
" i was going to come over at this sort of time to see my family , so to have the chance to play as well was something i jumped at .
" it was just a really good opportunity to play some old stuff and new stuff , and it is in a beautiful area too . "
after her performance at sesiwn fawr on friday , cerys planned to go trout fishing in north wales on saturday , before heading to london .
the gig is her only concert in the uk so far this year , and she is working on new material to follow up cockahoop .
" i have been writing since cockahoop came out and , when i get back to nashville in august , my priority is going to be to record a new album . "
" that is going to take up an awful lot of time - i get pretty stuck in once i start .
cerys and seth were married in west wales last year " the rest of my time is going to be hanging out with my family and friends - that normal kind of thing .
" what i am really looking forward to is being able to do a long tour to promote the new record . "
cerys described her life in america as " pretty laid back " .
" i love being a mum and i love living in a place where i am surrounded by like-minded people , and where music is everywhere - i just love that . "
" i am enjoying myself a lot out there . "
as for her memories of catatonia , she said she felt " proud of a lot of the songs " the band did .
" i am beginning to enjoy thinking about -lsb- the time in the band -rsb- now - we had some great times . "
catatonia had several major hits , including mulder and scully , road rage and an album track , international velvet , which became an unofficial welsh anthem with its chorus " every day when i wake up i thank the lord i 'm welsh " .
