" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 recognizing a common cultural history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwards enlargement prompted germany to reappraise the past at a recent symposium in berlin , germany 's culture minister said her country 's and eastern europe 's shared cultural identity should be seen as a starting point for improving ties between countries . with the german-polish relationship recently shaken by calls from both sides for reparations as a result of world war ii , the symposium organized by germany 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , had a particular urgency . germany 's shared cultural identity with eastern europe , the focus of the symposium on germany and its eastern neighbours , is also a matter with added relevance in the light of this year 's eastwards enlargement . " together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three . " afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects un nuclear demands iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " .

the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .

bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .

in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 recognizing a common cultural history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwards enlargement prompted germany to reappraise the past at a recent symposium in berlin , germany 's culture minister said her country 's and eastern europe 's shared cultural identity should be seen as a starting point for improving ties between countries . with the german-polish relationship recently shaken by calls from both sides for reparations as a result of world war ii , the symposium organized by germany 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , had a particular urgency . germany 's shared cultural identity with eastern europe , the focus of the symposium on germany and its eastern neighbours , is also a matter with added relevance in the light of this year 's eastwards enlargement . " together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .

an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .

" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .

according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .

" together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

" it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .

" when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.09.2004 eu says greek budget deficit revised großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how stable are the euro 's foundations ?
with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 it 's not the foreigners ' fault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners often shoulder the blame for economic woes parties from the extreme right might be enjoying a popularity spurt triggered by widespread unemployment and resentment of foreigners , but statistics show immigrants are n't to blame for germany 's economic malaise . as germany 's jobless rate hovers around 10 percent , both the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- have capitalized on spurious claims that foreigners deprive germans of jobs that are rightfully theirs . " close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

feedback should the esa have held back its announcement until it could show a more concrete link between life and the concentration of water vapor and methane gas ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .
-lrb- jan .
25 , 2001 -rrb- the second coming of columbus europe 's columbus research module will help scientists learn about the effects of space travel on humans and more .
the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three . " afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects un nuclear demands iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " .
-lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .
by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .

" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement .

last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child . " on top of this , they receive non-cash benefits such as accommodation and child-care , as well as one-off benefits , for example , after the birth of a child , " explains jochen hajungs from the government office for migration , refugees and integration .
but it hardly affords the average family a life of carefree luxury . others , meanwhile , argue that immigration is exactly what germany needs . despite the problems with integration highlighted in the recent state elections , the country will increasingly depend on tens of thousands of new immigrants each year to supplement its aging , shrinking population . katja hübschen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . -lrb- june 17 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 eu to reject turkey without law reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan will meet eu officials this week the european commission has warned turkey that it will not start talks on ankara 's bid to join the eu until it overhauls its penal code .
but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

" we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 recognizing a common cultural history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwards enlargement prompted germany to reappraise the past at a recent symposium in berlin , germany 's culture minister said her country 's and eastern europe 's shared cultural identity should be seen as a starting point for improving ties between countries . with the german-polish relationship recently shaken by calls from both sides for reparations as a result of world war ii , the symposium organized by germany 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , had a particular urgency . germany 's shared cultural identity with eastern europe , the focus of the symposium on germany and its eastern neighbours , is also a matter with added relevance in the light of this year 's eastwards enlargement . " together with our partners in poland , the czech republic , hungary , romania and the baltic states , we want to examine our history with a view to greater reconciliation and accepting our common cultural identity , " said weiss . not an ' us-and them ' situation before world war ii , millions of germans were scattered across eastern europe , closely integrated into the economic and cultural life of poland , the present-day czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , russia and kaliningrad .
it was n't until germany 's nazi regime came to power that these communities largely disintegrated .
another turning point come almost 50 years later . " 1989 marked the beginning of a new era , " historian karl schlögel said at the symposium , adding that germany 's perception of eastern europe underwent a major change .
" it was no longer an ' us-and-them ' situation , it was about understanding .
it was no longer about defending a position and exposing the mistakes of others , it was about objective assessment of the past . " avoiding revisionism many at the meeting were keen to stress the importance of avoiding a revisionist vision of history . " one can only agree with günter grass , who said that refusing to forget does not make anyone a revisionist , " weiss said . it 's a particularly thorny issue right now , given the recent debate surrounding the german expellees organizations ' planned international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans forced to flee poland after world war ii . as one of the first german writers to focus on the sufferings of germans in world war ii , grass triggered controversy in 2002 when he published the novel crabwalk , about the 1945 sinking of a refugee carrier , the wilhelm gustloff , an event that cost 9,000 germans their lives . short-sighted national understanding polish historian anna wolff-poweska pointed out that after 1989 , many poles found themselves reappraising their national identity and rediscovering a certain patriotic pride , a trend that gained added momentum on the back of globalization .
this renewed interest in the cultural legacy of polish history went hand-in-hand with a growing awareness of the german community in pre-war poland . " the revolution in eastern europe and the fall of the berlin wall shed light on how short-sighted the national understanding on poland 's cultural legacy has always been , " wolff-poweska said . recognizing the double-edged past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market square in wroclaw / breslau in poland awareness is slowly changing .
in the silesian city of breslau -lrb- photo -rrb- , for example , monuments to the former german presence have been expensively restored in a bid to acknowledge its cultural legacy .
it 's the same story in the cities of reval / tallin , königsberg / kaliningrad and hermannstadt / sibiu in transylvania , romania . " for some time there have been serious endeavours to recognize the double-edged past of these cities , " schlögel said .
" what may have seemed impossible 10 or 20 years ago has become very normal .
the relaxing of border controls and the end of cold war animosity has made everything more accessible . " meanwhile , the prince hermann von pückler park in bad muskau on the river neisse in lausitz , separating eastern germany and southwestern poland , is still in the process of a restoration funded by german and polish historical monument preservationists .
both the german and the polish government recently submitted an application to have the park added to unesco 's world heritage list on account of its symbolic status .
it 's one example of " what once linked -lrb- germany and eastern europe -rrb- and what can link it again , " weiss said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

feedback should the esa have held back its announcement until it could show a more concrete link between life and the concentration of water vapor and methane gas ?

but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2004 new clues to life on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two life-related substances could have a variety of sources on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .
but there are still plenty of questions about the information . data obtained by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- probe mars express and the us spacecraft mars odyssey show that in some equatorial locations , low-atmosphere levels of water vapor and methane " significantly overlap , " the esa said in a press statement monday .
the two substances are often connected to life since most scientists believe water is necessary for life and because methane is often produced by living organisms .
" we have a new piece in a puzzle about understanding whether there is possible life , past or present , on mars , " esa science spokesman roberto loverde told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express spacecraft is in orbit around the red planet the water vapor and methane gas concentrations were found in an area with an ice layer just below the planet 's surface .
when all the information is put together it points to " a common underground source , " such as volcanic or hydrothermal activity or , perhaps , bacterial life , which may exist in the water below the ice table , the agency said .
if the latter case is true , the bacteria would produce methane as a natural living process and the gas would be released into the atmosphere .
still grounds for speculation scientists , however , are quick to warn that methane gas , which comprises just a tiny part of the martian atmosphere , can also be produced in other ways a water-ice methane hydrate , which could come from microbial life or other sources , could also be responsible for the findings , michael mumma , an atmospheric scientist at the us space agency 's goddard space flight center , told the bbc .
" if you happened to warm that beyond the liquidation temperature , then you would free both methane and water together , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly what is on and under mars ' surface is still being researched underground volcanic sources could also explain the presence of water vapor and methane since they would push both substances to the surface .
the esa 's findings were made by the planetary fourier spectrometer -lrb- pfs -rrb- , a scientific tool onboard mars express made to determine the make-up of the planet 's atmosphere .
data 's real test still coming while calling the data interesting , colin pillinger , a professor at the open university in milton keynes and the chief scientist on the british-led beagle 2 mission , told the bbc the only way to prove a correlation between water and methane would be to measure it on the mars ' surface .
the information 's real test will happen when international scientists are able to get their hands on the data , according to james garvin , nasa 's chief scientist for mars and the moon .
" the message here is that exciting initial observations such as those reported by the mars express pfs are what catalyze new questions , observations , and ultimately testable hypotheses , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

but turkey has yet to abandon controversial plans to criminalize adultery . the penal code reform has ground to a halt in turkey 's parliament at a particularly sensitive time - the eu executive is due to issue a crucial appraisal of the country 's progress towards eu standards on oct .
6 . " the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will make clear that , as long as such a central element as the reform of the penal code is not adopted , accession negotiations can not start , " jean-christophe filori , the spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , said on monday . the commission 's report will serve as a basis for a dec .
17 decision by eu leaders on whether or not to give turkey , an official eu candidate since 1999 , a starting date for accession talks .
the turkish government 's withdrawal last week of the penal code bill , part of a raft of reforms designed to get the country in shape for the eu , has thrown new doubt on the commission 's verdict . verheugen , in interviews with several german newspapers on sunday , warned that implementation of the reforms to turkey 's criminal law were central to brussels giving a positive appraisal .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's justice and development party unexpectedly pulled the bill off the parliament floor last thursday - apparently to reintroduce a highly controversial clause that would restore adultery as a criminal offence . eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice and development party supporters .
the reintroduction of the adultery clause , which the party had previously dropped amid heavy pressure from the eu , was reportedly at the prompting of the powerful religious groups that form part of government 's hard line muslim support . turkish dailies said erdogan would tell verheugen at a meeting on thursday that the clause would have a narrow field of application and neither meddle with " civilized relationships between adults " nor curb individual freedoms .
but turkey 's many critics in the eu who are opposed to it ever joining the bloc point to the clause as evidence that the muslim-majority country is not " european " enough . a turkish government spokesman on monday said ankara would continue to improve its democracy and human rights record regardless of its future relationship with the eu . " let 's say they did not give us a date -lrb- for accession talks -rrb- in december , " cemil cicek said , according to the associated press .
" we are not going to beat our knees and weep .
turkey will continue on its road and it should . " when asked if the plan to criminalize adultery was still being considered , cicek was non-committal , reiterating the government 's line that turkey had other options to pursue if the country was snubbed by the eu . verheugen has warned the fate of the new penal code would determine " whether turkey was sufficiently on the road to a state of law and in line with european standards ... on respect for freedoms and fundamental rights . "
he has reportedly warned the turkish envoy that failure to pass the reform bill would make it " more difficult " to overcome the widespread opposition inside europe to turkish membership of the eu . before the controversy surrounding the adultery clause , verheugen had been widely expected to recommend the eu should open talks on turkey 's membership bid . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a change in mentality is needed " the eu commission is to publish a key report on october 6 on whether ankara is ready to open talks on joining the eu .

the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier . a recent poll by the canadian opinion research firm globescan asked some 34,000 people in 35 countries on their preferences for this year 's us presidential race in germany , a whopping 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush . besides making himself unpopular with the majority of germans , bush 's unilateralist policies and decision to invade iraq have also strained relations with several european leaders - most notably schröder and french president jacques chirac . kerry says he would try to repair ties with america 's traditional allies by taking a more multilateral approach to world affairs .
while that would likely help mend the transatlantic rift caused by the us-led campaign in iraq , it could also present a serious dilemma for vehement war opponents schröder and chirac . in a speech on monday , kerry said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , which would increase pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . " it 's true that kerry could make things more difficult for the europeans because he could force them to decide what they are really prepared to do , " bernhard may , an expert on transatlantic ties at the german council on foreign relations in berlin , told dw-world . european troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry could put chirac and schröder in a difficult position according to der spiegel newsmagazine , richard holbrooke , expected to become secretary of state if kerry is elected , recently told schröder the first thing the new us president would do would be to invite the german chancellor and chirac to the white house .
the implication being that he would push for a greater european military presence in iraq . " the president should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a un protection force , " kerry said in new york on monday .
" this wo n't be easy .
but even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in iraq should still help protect the un . " may cautioned that what the candidate kerry says now is not necessarily what he would do if in office .
but he added it would be difficult for germany and france to reject a plea from kerry to help protect a united nations in iraq . germany has so far said it would only help train iraqi police - outside of iraq .
but berlin would likely feel compelled to take part in a multilateral un mission in the country , since germany is currently campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council . " if germany wants a seat on the security council it may have to be prepared to show it is willing to take on more responsibility , " may said , adding that berlin would have to reorganize its troops overseas in order to free some up for deployment in iraq . germany 's armed forces are currently stretched to the limit with thousands of soldiers deployed in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere helping in the global fight against terrorism .
however , an eu police force could relieve military troops in kosovo , which could then become part of a un protection force . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kerry leads in the -lrb- world opinion -rrb- polls germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show .

" close the borders " was just one of npd 's xenophobic campaign slogans .
the dvu demanded : " german jobs for germans ! " boosting the economy with self-employment the reality is very different .
the german economics and labor ministry , or bmwa , reported that in 1999 , germany 's 55,000 self-employed turks registered an annual turnover of € 50 billion and created some 300,000 jobs , thereby providing a valuable boost to the economy .
the total number of self-employed foreigners increased from 138,000 in 1989 to 280,000 in 2003 . foreigners employed in germany also contribute to its gross national product and pay into pension and health insurance schemes .
according to germany 's rwi economic institute , the country 's 7.3 million foreigners actually contribute some € 15 billion more to society than they receive in state benefits . another prejudice is that foreigners send their earnings home rather than helping the german economy with consumer spending .
wrong again .
according to the bmwa , in 1984 € 9 billion was sent home by germany 's 1.6 million foreign employees .
in 2003 , their number had risen to 2.9 million , and they were sending home just € 6.8 billion . hardly a life of luxury there 's equally little evidence to suggest that foreigners exploit germany 's generous welfare system and are all too happy to take something for nothing .
an immigrant is only allowed to work after he or she has been resident in germany for one year , but only if a german or an eu national is unavailable .
in the meantime , all they 're eligible for is a monthly allowance of € 40 a month , plus € 20 for every child .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .

" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement .

with reports circulating that greece has repeated breached eu deficit limits in past years , the european commission said tuesday greek economic data had been revised .
the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .

the news may spell trouble for the euro 's stability . greece is facing heavy scrutiny over its budget deficit data after the commission said greek deficit figures had been revised .
eu officials , however , declined to say whether greece had been repeatedly in breach of the eu deficit limit - 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - as reported in a german newspaper tuesday . commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said eu statistics office eurostat was expected to release the latest eurozone deficit and debt figures later this week or early next . " so i can not myself release any figures at this stage , " thomas said , when asked about the report in süddeutsche zeitung that greece had revised upwards its deficit figures for 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . greece is already facing disciplinary measures after posting an estimated deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp last year .
it is on course for an even bigger deficit this year of 5.3 percent , according to the greek statistics office .
last year 's figure was revised sharply upwards after a new conservative government took office in greece in march and ordered an audit of the budget figures reported by the previous socialist administration . confirmation that the deficit figures for previous years have also been revised dramatically - the süddeutsche zeitung spoke of changes in the order of two percentage points - would be a major embarrassment for athens .
more seriously , it might also call into question the statistics used by greece to enter the eurozone in the first place . big discrepancies an eu source said those figures , covering the years 1998 and 1999 , were not yet in doubt .
but for the later years , " you might be surprised at the scope of the revisions , " he said on condition of anonymity .
the source said the revisions were caused by big discrepancies found in the greek social-security surplus , which has been found to be far smaller than previously thought , and to defense-related expenditure . the greek government says the € 7 billion -lrb- € 8.5 billion -rrb- cost of this summer 's athens olympic games will also keep the deficit well over the eu limit . eu finance ministers , expressing concern at the serial revisions to the greek figures , asked the european commission at a meeting in the netherlands on sept .
10 and 11 to draw up minimum standards for eu data by june 2005 . " the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- reiterates its view that the compilation and reporting of budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles , " the ministers said in a statement . " in the case of greece , it is of utmost importance to arrive soon at a clear and true picture of the situation and to draw the necessary consequences .
the credibility of budgetary surveillance crucially hinges upon reliable fiscal statistics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.09.2004 iran vows to continue nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president khatami said iran would pursue peaceful nuclear technology statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program . iran moved closer to a stand off with the international community when president mohammad khatami vowed on tuesday to continue a nuclear program some suspect is aimed at developing weapons , even if it means ending cooperation with the u.n. nuclear watchdog . " we 've made our choice : yes to peaceful nuclear technology , no to atomic weapons , " khatami said at a military parade in tehran .
" we will continue along our path even if it leads to an end to international supervision of our nuclear activities , " the iranian president said . khatami 's resolute statement echoes those made earlier in the day by a close advisor to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
ali akbar velayati , a former foreign minister and close aide to the ayatollah , called for tehran to stand firm in its drive for sensitive nuclear technology and to be ready to pay the diplomatic price , according to state news agency irna . iran will accept costs , says ayatollah 's aide " whenever we stand firm and defend our righteous stands resolutely , they are forced to retreat and have no alternatives , " velayati said .
" if a nation aims at reaching scientific and technological perfection and embracing high standards in national achievement , there will be costs it has to accept , " velayati , who has also been tipped as a possible future president of the country , added . the statements come as iran announced that it had begun converting a large amount of uranium ore into the gas feedstock needed to enrich uranium .
the move , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , is one which us officials have charged could produce enough material to make several atomic bombs . enrichment tests a success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reza aghazadeh .
iranian atomic energy chief reza aghazadeh told reporters in vienna that some of the 37 tons of uranium yellowcake , or ore , which iran had previously said it would be converting had now been used .
" tests have been successful , " he added .
yellowcake is converted into uranium gas which is then fed into centrifuges to make enriched uranium .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian reactors , but also the explosive core for atomic bombs . the united states , which charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , said that industrial-scale uranium conversion , even if tehran only designated this as " tests " , would be an alarming sign that iran is continuing its alleged quest of the bomb . aghazadeh said that iran has the centrifuge technology in place in order to convert the gas feedstock into enriched uranium if it so decided .
his announcement at a general conference of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was the first confirmation that iran had actually begun the large-scale conversion .
it was not clear , however , exactly when this took place . november deadline set by iaea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea adopted a resolution on saturday that demands iran halt its controversial uranium enrichment-related activities , a part of the nuclear fuel cycle that can be directed to both energy and weapons purposes .
in a compromise text hammered out by the three main european powers - britain , france and germany - and the united states , the un watchdog also gave iran until november 25 to clear up suspicions it is seeking nuclear weapons . iran insists it is only trying to generate nuclear power , and contends that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes , including enrichment , is permitted under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
refusal to abide by the resolution could mean the country is referred to the un security council for possible sanctions , something the united states has been lobbying for . resolution dismissed as us pandering velayati said washington was merely trying to " paralyze all our activities and will not cease until they have erased us from the scene . "
he also denounced the europeans , who have been spearheading diplomatic efforts to ensure iranian cooperation with the iaea , as " expansionist " and " trying to please washington . " " those who are familiar with these countries and the history of international diplomacy never count on the promises of such countries , " he said in regards to iran 's talks with the eu 's " big three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 21.09.2004 dortmund gives away win in final minutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's goal in the 88th minute brought munich back to life two quick goals in a sensational game 's final minutes meant borussia dortmund had to share points with arch rival bayern munich after the two of bundesliga 's top teams faced off in westfalen stadium on saturday . after taking the lead with first and second half goals from brazilian striker ewerthon , bayern came back to life in the 88th minute when munich 's defender lucio headed in a goal , making amends for an otherwise shaky game .
possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .
hamburg spent € 10 million -lrb- $ 12.1 million -rrb- in the last season but lie third from bottom following four defeats in five games . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to domestic bundesliga business the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .

possibly still a little tired from a champions league win in israel earlier in the week , it was n't until added time that dutch striker roy makaay 's equalizer ruined the party enthusiastic dortmund fans were just getting ready to start .
despite scraping out the tie , bayern is off to its worst start in 25 years .
champions league winners back to earth also returning from a convincing 3-0 champion 's league win over real madrid , bayer leverkusen continued to perplex its supporters struggling to a 2-2 home draw against fc nuremberg .
manager klaus augenthaler was tearing his hair out at the bayarena as his side went two goals down to nuremberg , who played last season in the second division .
a penalty kick from goalkeeper hans-jorg butt and another strike from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov four minutes later rescued bayer from the jaws of defeat .
with bayern and bayer both dropping points , german champions werder bremen took advantage of a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 to jump into third place in the league standings .
bremen 's new signing , german national player miroslav klose , put in his first home goal for his new team and got help from valerien ismael and johan micoud to round out the scoring in the convincing win over a weaker hanover side .
vfl wolfsburg are the new leaders of the german top flight with a 2-1 win over hansa rostock , its third home loss in a row .
goals from diego klimowicz and pablo thiam extended wolfsburg 's strong season start and put the team one point ahead of vfb stuttgart , last week 's top squad .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart jinx continues stuttgart played to a 0-0 draw with a 10-man hertha berlin side on sunday .
even after hertha 's angolan international nando rafael was sent off in the 43rd minute for kicking the ball into the stands , stuttgart was n't able to put an end to the 13-year winless curse it 's been suffering every time it makes the trip to berlin .
arminia bielefeld also was n't able to capitalize after fsv mainz 05 's marco rose got his second yellow card of the game and was sent off .
even though the draw was enough to bring bielefeld one spot out the bundesliga basement , it will probably be a long time before ervin skela forgets missing the penalty kick that could have handed his team the win .
even without a manager , schalke 04 continued its revival with a 3-2 comeback win over borussia monchengladbach .
danish national player ebbe sand struck the back of the net in the 66th minute to clinch all three points and crown a great week , in which he has scored four times in two outings .
a 1-1 tie let both sc freiburg and vfl bochum remained unbeaten after five weeks of bundesliga action .
bochum substitute tommy bechmann opened the scoring in after 55 minutes .
it only took the home team 's daniel schumann three minutes to level the game , packing nearly all the action in this rather dull match into a tight couple of minutes .
meanwhile , the odds on klaus toppmoller being the second managerial casualty of the 2004/05 season shortened after his sv hamburg side lost 2-1 at kaiserslautern .

toni-ann byfield from birmingham was shot alongside bertram byfield , 41 , just over a year ago at a flat in harlesden , north west london .
police believe mr byfield , a convicted drug dealer , may have been killed over a drug debt .
a reward of £ 25,000 is being offered for information that leads to those responsible for the murders .
toni-ann had been allowed by social services staff in birmingham to visit mr byfield in london .
he was not her biological father , but the child regarded him as such .
detectives think mr byfield had links to the british link up crew , a group of jamaican crack dealers running cocaine between the uk and jamaica .
' drug debt ' det ch insp neil basu said mr byfield , formerly known as anthony pinnock , was owed £ 25,000 .
" we are investigating the possibility that mr. byfield was killed over a drug debt that he previously tried to collect .
" this day last year , a seven-year-old girl was shot dead in front of the man she loved as a father , only moments before he too had been fatally wounded .
" i would like the public to bear in mind that the persons ultimately responsible for her death are the person who pulled the trigger that morning and the person who ordered it to happen .
" i want to bring those people to justice . "
detectives believe toni-ann , who was shot in the back , may have been killed to stop her identifying the gunman .
the girl had been raised in jamaica but arrived in the uk in june 2000 to stay with relatives in birmingham .
a full reconstruction of the case will be shown on crimewatch on bbc 1 at 2100 bst on tuesday .

" we are now in a position to take a lead and consult residents on the basis of that conclusion .

the fostering network said the country is short of 700 carers and has called on ministers to invest more funding in fostering services .
more than 3,000 children are living with just over 2,000 foster families .
experts stressed that the severe shortage of carers means many children have to move households several times during their time in care .
the fostering network warned the crippling shortage of carers will only begin to be fully tackled when there is proper investment in fostering services .
local authorities know there is much work to be done , and many are actively developing recruitment and retention strategies bryan ritchie the fostering network scottish spokesman bryan ritchie said : " the situation was bad enough in 2002 , and this survey shows an alarming rise in the number of carers needed .
" too many children 's lives are being badly disrupted with frequent moves and foster homes a long way from family , friends and school . "
mr ritchie said the system was not providing these children with the security they need .
he said : " local authorities know there is much work to be done , and many are actively developing recruitment and retention strategies . "
" but the fostering network believes this crippling shortage will only begin to be fully tackled when these words are backed up by proper investment in fostering services . "
the scottish executive has acknowledged the problem and insisted that it is committed to improving support for fosterers .
campaigners have also demanded the same amount of cash for all foster families , as many currently end up out of pocket .
they have called for carers to be paid as employees rather than volunteers .
one residential school - kibble , in paisley - has been offering more than £ 20,000 per year to try to attract carers from other occupations .
statistics from the scottish executive showed one in four children living away from home in public care lived in three or more homes in the year ending 31 march , 2003 .

the fostering network said the country is short of 700 carers and has called on ministers to invest more funding in fostering services .
more than 3,000 children are living with just over 2,000 foster families .
experts stressed that the severe shortage of carers means many children have to move households several times during their time in care .
the fostering network warned the crippling shortage of carers will only begin to be fully tackled when there is proper investment in fostering services .
local authorities know there is much work to be done , and many are actively developing recruitment and retention strategies bryan ritchie the fostering network scottish spokesman bryan ritchie said : " the situation was bad enough in 2002 , and this survey shows an alarming rise in the number of carers needed .
" too many children 's lives are being badly disrupted with frequent moves and foster homes a long way from family , friends and school . "
mr ritchie said the system was not providing these children with the security they need .
he said : " local authorities know there is much work to be done , and many are actively developing recruitment and retention strategies . "
" but the fostering network believes this crippling shortage will only begin to be fully tackled when these words are backed up by proper investment in fostering services . "
the scottish executive has acknowledged the problem and insisted that it is committed to improving support for fosterers .
campaigners have also demanded the same amount of cash for all foster families , as many currently end up out of pocket .
they have called for carers to be paid as employees rather than volunteers .
one residential school - kibble , in paisley - has been offering more than £ 20,000 per year to try to attract carers from other occupations .

she said then she was out to break the mould of british politics with the creation of the centre-left social democratic party .
when she made her final party appearance as a front line liberal democrat on monday , she was handed an emotional standing ovation .
and she left , declaring the walls of two party politics were crumbling .
as she shuffled , in characteristic style , off the stage at the bournemouth conference centre she could have been in no doubt about the special place she held in the affections of the delegates .
it is something baroness williams must have grown used to over the years .
prime minister even many in the labour party , which she quit in 1981 as part of the " gang of four " sdp founders , still regard her with warmth .
many were deeply saddened when she left them , citing exasperation at the behaviour of the left-wing in the party .
that was not simply because of her straight forward , honest , if shambolic , margaret rutherfordesque , character .
they saw a formidable , natural politician and potential woman labour prime minister abandoning them .
others , it must be said , were furious and blame her and her other " co-conspirators " for helping lead labour into the wilderness .
they have not , and probably never will forgive her .
but few who know shirley williams would ever accuse her of insincerity , political vanity or lack of principle .
at home her dream of creating a radical new force in british politics - which once appeared tantalisingly within her grasp - crashed .
the sdp fell and is recalled now only by the democrat bit of the lib dem name .
and , of course , she and her fellow gang members stood on the sidelines as tony blair , gordon brown and peter mandelson created pretty much the centre-left party she wanted .
had she stayed with labour would she now feel at home ?
would she have been a leader ?
she has never displayed any sign she is anything other than comfortable in her liberal democrat skin .
and the lib dems were clearly more than happy to have her as their leader in the lords .
but those questions will always nag .
twenty three years after her defining political decision , she is still waiting for her party to be the one to change the face of british politics .
