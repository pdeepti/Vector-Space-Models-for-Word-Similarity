after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .

for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .

men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .
dilek zaptcioglu , © qantara.de 2003 translation from german : patrick lanagan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .

parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the christian democrats , michael glos accused chancellor schröder ’ s government of offering an eu entry perspective to ankara in a " cloak and dagger operation " only in order to get the votes of the 500,000 turkish-origin voters in germany .
glos said his party would bring up the topic in looming eu polls , but " without xenophobic overtones . "
deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang schäuble suggested the eu offer ankara a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .
“ but there are two sets of legal advice . ” dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

dbv spokesman michael lohse said not a single cow " should be allowed to slip through " during the close to three million bse tests conducted every year and that consumers should be able to trust the fact that the beef they eat has been checked for mad cow disease .
on tuesday , it emerged that at least 76 cows in rhineland-palatinate and saarland hadn ’ t been tested for bse and the state of lower saxony is also probing whether untested meat could have landed in the market . officials in saarland say more than 10,000 cases of insufficient bse tests have come to light throughout germany .
at the same time lohse pointed towards the " enormous work " that bse testing in germany entails .
unlike eu regulations that stipulate beef cattle over 30 months of age should be tested for bse , in germany all cattle over 24 months are tested . more briefs 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership 06.01.2004 -pipe- plan to create a ' german harvard ' sparks debate 06.01.2004 -pipe- global concert for world understanding 06.01.2004 -pipe- thomas cook refuses armed air marshals 06.01.2004 -pipe- deutsche post gives in to green pressure 05.01.2004 -pipe- csu says : keep kids at home 05.01.2004 -pipe- innovation is at center of spd goals 2004 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .

he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .
“ but there are two sets of legal advice . ” dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

the gathering of party leaders focused on new requirements in education and research as well as ways of encouraging innovation in the fields .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .

religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .
dilek zaptcioglu , © qantara.de 2003 translation from german : patrick lanagan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

on tuesday , it emerged that at least 76 cows in rhineland-palatinate and saarland hadn ’ t been tested for bse and the state of lower saxony is also probing whether untested meat could have landed in the market . officials in saarland say more than 10,000 cases of insufficient bse tests have come to light throughout germany .
at the same time lohse pointed towards the " enormous work " that bse testing in germany entails .

dbv spokesman michael lohse said not a single cow " should be allowed to slip through " during the close to three million bse tests conducted every year and that consumers should be able to trust the fact that the beef they eat has been checked for mad cow disease .
on tuesday , it emerged that at least 76 cows in rhineland-palatinate and saarland hadn ’ t been tested for bse and the state of lower saxony is also probing whether untested meat could have landed in the market . officials in saarland say more than 10,000 cases of insufficient bse tests have come to light throughout germany .
at the same time lohse pointed towards the " enormous work " that bse testing in germany entails .
unlike eu regulations that stipulate beef cattle over 30 months of age should be tested for bse , in germany all cattle over 24 months are tested . more briefs 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership 06.01.2004 -pipe- plan to create a ' german harvard ' sparks debate 06.01.2004 -pipe- global concert for world understanding 06.01.2004 -pipe- thomas cook refuses armed air marshals 06.01.2004 -pipe- deutsche post gives in to green pressure 05.01.2004 -pipe- csu says : keep kids at home 05.01.2004 -pipe- innovation is at center of spd goals 2004 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .

he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .

he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .

parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the christian democrats , michael glos accused chancellor schröder ’ s government of offering an eu entry perspective to ankara in a " cloak and dagger operation " only in order to get the votes of the 500,000 turkish-origin voters in germany .
glos said his party would bring up the topic in looming eu polls , but " without xenophobic overtones . "
deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang schäuble suggested the eu offer ankara a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .
i felt as if someone were playing a horrible game with me , forcing me to choose between my faith and my studies . "
no compromise was possible : nilüfer left the room – and , eventually , she left the university , too .
indeed , in turkey , as elsewhere , the controversy seems bound to grow ever more acrimonious .
the muslim headscarf is a political issue par excellence .

the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion . it ’ s an everyday sight in istanbul : fashionably coiffeured women sitting in the bus alongside others wearing the muslim headscarf .
in big shopping centers , women with their heads covered stand at the sales tables next to others with their hair worn free .
yet this peaceful coexistence is deceptive .
in turkey , no other topic gets people so worked up as the muslim headscarf .
for some , it ’ s a symbol of religious fanaticism and the oppression of women that ultimately has to be banished from public life .
others are convinced that the veiling of women is commanded by the koran , and they argue that a ban would infringe their right to practice their religion freely – something that is anchored in the country ’ s democratic constitution .
so far , the state of affairs in turkey may sound very similar to the situation in germany or france ; and indeed , in all these countries , the same kind of arguments are marshalled by both sides .
in turkey , too , the debate is being conducted with increasingly passionate intensity through the various channels of the mass media .
but there is one significant difference : in contrast to the western european countries , turkey is populated mainly by muslims .
religion and politics are separated by law this doesn ’ t mean , however , that turkey is " an islamic country , " for since the foundation of modern turkey 80 years ago , the country has defined itself as a " secular state , " in which religion and politics are to be strictly separated by law .
turkish girls are already forbidden to wear headscarves to school , from the first day of primary-level education onwards .
nonetheless , this is a topic that has been the source of heated controversy in turkey for decades – and in the current battle , the schools and universities form the front line .
" having lost islam for a time , humankind has found it again .
we all grew up in the 80s and 90s – and we are now witnessing the collapse of western civilization !
the revival of religion moves on from strength to strength ! "
these are the rallying cries of young , veiled , women at the university of istanbul - women who make no secret of their islamist worldview .
for most of these educated , metropolitan students , islam has become an ideology that allows them to interpret the present while pointing the way towards the future .
the headscarf has long since become the symbol for an " islamic ideology " that refuses to see religious faith as something to be " caged in " in the private sphere ; instead , it wants to see this faith " lived out " in every area of public and private life .
in her recent commentary on the french plan to ban the headscarf , the well-known islamist lawyer sibel eraslan described the muslim headscarf as a symbol of " an alternative , divine set of coordinates , diametrically opposed to the basic principles of western modernity . "
headscarves returned to fashion in the 60s it ’ s true that the revival of the veil has been accompanied by a strengthening of the role played by islam in modern turkish society .
in the 30s and 40s , headscarves disappeared from the turkish cities , only to reappear in greater numbers in the course of the 60s .
until then , there had been a one-party system in turkey .
the strictly secular republican people ’ s party had paid close attention to upholding the clothing reforms introduced by kemal atatürk .
men were forbidden to wear the turban , the fez or the kaftan , while women were banned from wearing the charshaf , the black " sheet " that conceals the entire body with the exception of the eyes or the face .
women are , and were , permitted to wear a headscarf at home or on the street – but not in the state-controlled areas : in schools , universities , hospitals , and government offices , no kind of veil or headscarf is permitted .
many contemporary turkish women see the headscarf as the symbol of a counter-revolution that wants to rob them of everything they have won .
but is this really the goal of the " headscarf movement ? "
if so , it must be celebrating the progress made today , when headscarves and " modest " ankle-length dresses are worn by the wives of almost every senior politician in the turkish government .
a difficult choice most of the " veiled " young women in the turkish cities are also the children of atatürk ’ s modernized turkey .
and they don ’ t want to be oppressed by men .
in the case of these young women , the headscarf ban has precisely the opposite effect intended .
after studying medicine for four years , nilüfer pehlivan was forced to abandon her dream of becoming a doctor , for she was not permitted to take up a medical residency .
she describes the crucial meeting with her professor : " he compared it with a set of scales .
he told me to imagine the headscarf on one side and my course of studies on the other - and he asked me which weighed more heavily in the balance .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.01.2004 german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ? after chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats aired proposals to set up a small network of elite universities similar to ones in the united states and britain , editorials across the country criticized the initiative . senior members of germany ’ s ruling social democratic party ended a two-day strategy meeting in the eastern town of weimar .
the gathering of party leaders focused on new requirements in education and research as well as ways of encouraging innovation in the fields .
science and education minister edelgard bulmahn pushed for the founding of a small network of elite universities to be financed out of state coffers berlin ’ s leftist neues deutschland slamed the idea , pointing out that virtually all of the country ’ s universities are facing cuts in funding because allegedly no money is available .
at the same time students take to the streets to protest closures at universities and overcrowding in lecture halls , poorly equipped libraries and laboratories , millions of euros are to be earmarked for a prestige project dubbed elite university , the paper criticized .
" in other words , it continued , money will be spent where none is available , " and to top it off , the funds will go towards a project that only benefits a few .
the badisches tagblatt suggested that the spd is only testing the wind of public reaction .
should the idea be rejected , it will just disappear in the drawer again , the paper stated .
and if nothing more comes out of it , at least the message will have been conveyed that the spd stands for education .
the heilbronner stimme was less critical but at the same time stressed that elite universities like those in britain or the united states can ’ t simply be " pulled out of a hat " even if a lot of money is available .
the daily noted that such revered institutions are the result of decades or even centuries of extreme efforts in research and education .
what edelgard bulmahn is proposing is at most a first step , it concluded .
other editorials too focused their attention on the fate of germany ’ s neo-liberal free democratic party , fdp , which has been in opposition in berlin for the past five and a half years after acting as junior coalition partner in virtually all federal governments since world war ii .
the ostthüringer zeitung projected rather dismal prospects for the party in 2004 , a year in which an unusually high number of state elections are taking place .
in all but one election , the party is in the opposition in the state assembly and in the remaining one it has failed as a coalition partner .
according to the neue westfälische newspaper , the fdp – as the smallest opposition party both at federal and state level – has a difficult time attracting attention and getting people to listen to it .
but instead of fighting for recognition by offering reasonable and convincing alternatives to chancellor schröder ’ s policies , the free democrats with guido westerwelle at the helm simply concentrate their sights on the next headline .
westerwelle is still delighted , the paper commented , every time the spotlights are directed on him .
the paper observed that the mumbling within the fdp that the party has nothing to offer where content is concerned is growing louder and louder and could turn towards westerwelle himself . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .

an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .

we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .

after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon . european markets have trudged through several dismal years when it comes to new public offerings .
it 's a stark difference from the heady days of the late 1990s and 2000 .
but things began to pick up in late 2003 , and market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 may bring a significant upturn in the number of european ipos .
in the fourth quarter of 2003 , 67 companies went public in europe , according to a report called ipo watch europe from pricewaterhousecoopers – up from 33 offerings in the third quarter and from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2002 .
the report includes activity in the 15 eu countries as well as switzerland and norway . € 30 billion expected from ipos in 2004 dealogic , which tracks ipos , said european offering brought in just € 5.6 billion in 2003 , down from the record € 398 billion in 2000 .
it expects 2004 to bring in € 30 billion , with the biggest offerings being belgacom , the belgian telecommunications firm , worth € 4 billion , and the deutsche post ’ s postbank , listed at € 2.5 billion .
“ we expect the next year to be a turning point for germany , ” volker fitzner , a partner in the corporate finance division of pricewaterhousecoopers , told manager magazin .
“ the postbank will play a special role , because if it ’ s successful it could break the ice for further public offerings . ”
the postbank offering is expected in fall 2004 – and it recently announced that some of the shares will be available to private investors .
the postbank is germany ’ s largest financial services provider and has more than 11 million customers .
postbank boss wolf von schimmelmann has said that he expects record profits in 2004 .
and one recent coup is expected to contribute to its 2004 performance – starting this year , it will begin handling monetary transactions for the deutsche bank and for dresdner bank .
an attempt to improve profits by up to € 100 million in addition , the bank has instituted a program called “ fit for the future ” under which it plans to lower costs and improve service with a goal of boosting profits by € 80 to € 100 million annually .
the bank is also seeking out wealthy customers and plans to have more than 500 bank branches in post offices throughout germany .
in addition , it plans to cut overhead by slashing jobs from 8,800 to 7,500 .
“ postbank is currently undervalued , ” norbert schäfer , a spokesman for the parent company deutsche post , told deutsche welle .
“ that will change when it goes public .
we expect to take in around € 2.5 billion with the share issue .
we ’ ll be able to use that money to pay off debts and undertake new investments .
it ’ s a huge boost for the company . ”
indeed , there is reason for optimism on the european markets .
but georg hansel , head of german equity capital markets at deutsche bank in frankfurt , sounded a note of caution .
“ there ’ s an unbelievable increase in activity , ” hansel told time magazine .
“ but there are just a few big deals handled by fewer banks .
the dotcoms aren ’ t coming back yet .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said on wednesday the decision of eu finance ministers to suspend the bloc ’ s deficit rules in november was illegal .
but the commission has yet to decide on a court challenge . in what could lead to a high-profile clash between the european commission in brussels and a number of eu member states , solbes said the commission ’ s legal service had determined there was no basis for circumventing the disciplinary procedures the european union ’ s growth and stability pact . led by the germany and france , eu finance ministers in november opted to suspend the sanctions process against those countries currently flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
a commission spokesman said the eu ’ s executive body would likely decide whether to take the issue to the european court of justice next week . clarifying the framework solbes told a press conference that a court ruling could help “ clarify the framework in which budgetary surveillance is conducted in the future , ” according to reuters news agency .
some officials in brussels fear the action by the finance ministers could set a legal precedent if it goes unchallenged . solbes has been highly critical of the suspension of the pact , which dictates that the 12 euro zone members are supposed to keep their budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face possible sanction from the commission .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . but finance ministers in november agreed to accept a political commitment from berlin and paris to get back under the limit by 2005 .
both countries will now effectively avoid further disciplinary action as they try to spur growth via less restrictive fiscal policies .
were the commission to pursue legal action on the matter and win , germany and france could then quickly face heavy fines under the original stability pact guidelines . commission must decide a spokesman for the german finance ministry said on wednesday berlin saw no grounds for action on the deficit matter .
he added that the opinion of the eu ’ s legal department had not yet been accepted by the european commission . “ that is one interpretation , ” the spokesman told reuters .
“ it is not the interpretation of the eu council of ministers or the federal government . ” solbes does not seem to have the backing of all 20 commission members for legal action .
according to media reports , commission president romano prodi and british , french and german commissioners support a more pragmatic approach . but irish finance minister charlie mccreevy , the current chairman of the eu ’ s ecofin council , on wednesday appeared to be resigned that the issue could only be resolved by the courts .
he told a press conference in dublin that the finance ministers had received their own legal advice and had determined their decision in november was in line with eu law . “ i ’ m very understanding of the commission 's view of its role as a guardian of the treaties , " mccreevy said .
“ but there are two sets of legal advice . ” dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

“ we are not willing to say exactly what he said . ”

parliamentary leader of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the christian democrats , michael glos accused chancellor schröder ’ s government of offering an eu entry perspective to ankara in a " cloak and dagger operation " only in order to get the votes of the 500,000 turkish-origin voters in germany .
glos said his party would bring up the topic in looming eu polls , but " without xenophobic overtones . "
deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang schäuble suggested the eu offer ankara a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .

stopping places research shows that serious health and education problems within the travelling community are at least in part caused by the decline of traditional stopping places .
the council said unauthorised camps cost devon landowners more than £ 25,000 a month , but this scheme would ease the problem without costing the council tax payer anything .
the county council says that when unofficial places are closed down , the problem just moves elsewhere .
the sites at haldon and near totnes would have showers , toilets , clean water , electricity and travellers would have to pay rent .
both sites are currently occupied by travellers .
people concerned councillor brian berman , whose ward , belvedere , includes haldon , said he was in favour of the scheme .
he said about 15 to 20 families at the haldon site who had been there for some time had a tacit agreement with the county council to stay there for two to three years because they had nowhere else to go .
but he said there had been a fresh influx of travellers in the last few months who he said had caused a big mess in the area and local people were becoming concerned .
in addition to the two sites , the county council also wants to develop a network of roadside emergency stopping places on council-controlled land .
these would not have the facilities of a transit site , but would provide a place to stop for a few days if there was an urgent need .

a boom in the construction industry has led to a shortage of skilled electricians , bricklayers and plumbers in wales .
major civil engineering projects and increased demand for building work on homes means that an estimated 7,500 extra construction workers will be needed in wales during the next four years .
industry figures predict that in the years up to 2007 in wales , there will be a need for a further 2,800 employees in wood trades , 1,800 bricklayers , 1,800 electricians and 1,200 painters .
welsh education minister , jane davidson , is launching a new training initiative aimed at tackling the issue at cardiff 's city hall on wednesday .
the skills council for the construction industry 's initiative will also ask industry leaders to identify exactly where the skill shortages are .
the new £ 55m welsh assembly building is a major construction project in a recent survey of welsh companies , the construction industry training board found that 69 % of participating companies had found difficulties in recruiting skilled staff , with employers experiencing the most difficulty in recruiting carpenters and joiners and bricklayers .
more than a third of employers also reported problems with new employees lacking the variety of skills required for certain jobs .
there are around 93,000 people - 8 % of the total workforce - employed in 10,000 businesses in the construction industry in wales .
major welsh projects which have created the extra demand for skilled construction workers include the building of the £ 700m cardiff international sports village , the £ 55m welsh assembly building and the wales millennium centre for the arts , which is due to open in november .
other planned projects which have fuelled a demand for building workers include a proposed 30-turbine offshore wind farm at scarweather sands , off porthcawl , the proposed development of film studios at llanharan , near bridgend and city centre developments in swansea .

industry figures predict that in the years up to 2007 in wales , there will be a need for a further 2,800 employees in wood trades , 1,800 bricklayers , 1,800 electricians and 1,200 painters .
welsh education minister , jane davidson , is launching a new training initiative aimed at tackling the issue at cardiff 's city hall on wednesday .
the skills council for the construction industry 's initiative will also ask industry leaders to identify exactly where the skill shortages are .
the new £ 55m welsh assembly building is a major construction project in a recent survey of welsh companies , the construction industry training board found that 69 % of participating companies had found difficulties in recruiting skilled staff , with employers experiencing the most difficulty in recruiting carpenters and joiners and bricklayers .
more than a third of employers also reported problems with new employees lacking the variety of skills required for certain jobs .
there are around 93,000 people - 8 % of the total workforce - employed in 10,000 businesses in the construction industry in wales .
major welsh projects which have created the extra demand for skilled construction workers include the building of the £ 700m cardiff international sports village , the £ 55m welsh assembly building and the wales millennium centre for the arts , which is due to open in november .
other planned projects which have fuelled a demand for building workers include a proposed 30-turbine offshore wind farm at scarweather sands , off porthcawl , the proposed development of film studios at llanharan , near bridgend and city centre developments in swansea .

the labour mp for monmouth , huw edwards , has written to gordon brown to alert him to the decision to spend much of the money on social services .
mr brown announced the money would be given to local authorities in wales in his pre-budget report .
the uk government expected the money to be used to limit council tax rises .
but on tuesday it was revealed that the cash will now be spent on solving the bed blocking crisis .
several mps raised the issue with the welsh secretary peter hain during a private meeting at westminster on tuesday night . "
i think people out there , across families in wales , who are really dealing with this difficult problem , will be very pleased " sue essex and mr edwards has written to the chancellor asking him to investigate .
he said he was " staggered " by the assembly 's actions .
" nobody is denying that there is a need for more money in social care services but the chancellor could n't have had that in mind at the time , and i 'm asking him if he 's satisfied the money is being allocated in the way he intended . "
mr edwards said there was a lot of disquiet among welsh mps over the issue .
" many of us are committed devolutionists but i do n't think devolution is working in this case .
" i have a higher regard for the assembly than many of my colleagues but this policy has been implemented wrongly . "
the treasury says it is up to the assembly to decide what to do with the money .
and the assembly government insists the money is going where it is most needed .
finance minister sue essex explained she was handing the money out directly to councils to be used specifically to pay for housing and more home care places for elderly people .
that way they can leave hospital more quickly as they will be cared for in their homes and free up beds for patients who need medical treatment .
she says the decision was made to tackle a key concern for people in wales - to make sure people could be looked after in their own homes - one of the biggest challenges currently facing wales .
" i think people out there , across families in wales , who are really dealing with this difficult problem , will be very pleased . "
but russell goodway , the mayor of cardiff and the welsh local government association 's finance spokesman , said it was a decision but that had been " very ill thought through . "
" the chancellors intention to cushion increases in council tax can not now be delivered , " he said .
" the problem is the money is a one off grant .
" if we increase the spending on social care for one year it means in a year 's time we have to cut it back again and this is n't a sustainable position .
" we will find a creative way of spending the money where it most needed - on the priorities of the cardiff council tax payer , " he added .

every day this week , we are revealing one artist in the sound of 2004 top five until the number one artist is revealed on friday .

after working his way up through jungle and garage , wiley is now heading a new musical style called eski beat or grime , which mixes uk garage with us hip-hop and jamaican ragga .
that style is inspired by deeper emotions than the usual rave tunes , he says , making him deeper and darker than other artists .
the 24-year-old has already sold at least 50,000 records after releasing one track a month for two years on his own label , according to his estimates .
wiley appeared on dizzee rascal 's award-winning album he now has a deal with xl records , home to his friend and collaborator dizzee rascal , who won the mercury music prize in 2003 .
growing up in bow , east london , like dizzee rascal , wiley says he has played music for as long as he can remember .
his parents split when he was young but his dad was in a band and gave him early exposure to reggae and ragga soundsystems .
at school with other soon-to-be garage stars , wiley started by djing , then doing his own live vocals and producing his own tunes .
" we all went to school and we did n't really want to do no schoolwork , so music was the other thing , " he tells bbc news online .

he made his name as part of the garage pay as u go crew , then formed his own roll deep crew , which numbered dizzee rascal among its members .
now , his music is taking the current garage music scene forward , he says , because it is " more feelings music " than the rest of the genre .
" when i make a beat it 's the feeling coming out of me from when i had an argument last week with my girl , or when i had an argument with my mum , " he says .
" that 's what 's important about my music - it 's a reflection of my person . "
it can be bright as well as dark , he says .
" but a lot of the time i am in a darker mood . "
wiley 's songs often have a cold theme , with titles like eskimo , ice rink and igloo , and reflect the troubles of his own life , he says .
these have included being the target of a shooting , he says , and falling 20 feet -lrb- six metres -rrb- through a roof while being chased by police from a pirate radio station .
mobbed he also says he has not been accepted by many in the garage scene because of his new direction - but insists he does not need them to succeed .
" i 've made music that loads of people in my country have started to follow , " he says .
" it has n't made garage die , because garage is not dead - garage has gone over into a different section . "
wiley already gets mobbed by fans in the street , he says , and hundreds of people try to call his mobile every day , forcing him to change his number regularly .
he now has his sights set on commercial success , aiming to become the uk answer to us rap moguls like p diddy with his own record label and clothing range .
" i 'm not going to turn commercial , but yes , i want to succeed , " he says .
" i want to succeed in life as a whole , not just in music . "
the sound of 2004 survey was compiled from the tips of almost 60 impartial music critics and broadcasters , who were asked to give three names of artists they thought would be successful in 2004 .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- india 's economy : can the boom last ?
home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages urdu hindi bengali pashto nepali tamil sinhala more last updated : wednesday , 7 january , 2004 , 08:46 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version india 's economy : can the boom last ?
by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university for the indian economy the year 2003 ended on a high - on 20 december , the foreign exchange reserves breached the $ 100bn mark .
fancy shopping malls cater to newly-enriched consumers the year also saw indian companies breaking into the international corporate market , making 35 global acquisitions totalling $ 450m .
thinking internationally , prime minister atal behari vajpayee floated the idea of a common currency for south asia .
and the industrial sector is booming .
car sales in november were 41 % higher than the previous year .
overall , gross domestic product is expected to grow by more than 7 % in the financial year ending in march 2004 .
but it is easy to over-interpret this news .
your views on india 's economic prospects growth challenge a sober analysis indicates that india is continuing to do well , as it has done since 1993 , with 6 % per annum average growth .
boom-time in bombay : record share prices spark a trading frenzy this robustness , combined with the advantage of its size , means that it is a country that global players can not ignore .
but if india is to go beyond this , to a sustained annual growth rate of over 8 % , and with benefits reaching all levels of society , more needs to be done by government than whipping up electoral support by pointing to the headlines .
it is worth remembering that india has seen brief growth spurts before - its growth rate in 1988-89 exceeded 10 % .
the challenge therefore , is to bring about sustained growth .
economic interest consider the $ 100bn foreign exchange -lrb- forex -rrb- news .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
the large reserve points to a good performance by the reserve bank - the reserve was $ 5.83bn in 1991 .
but , in itself , this does not mean as much as the screaming newspaper headlines on 21 december suggested .
what was more significant was the fact that the news made the headlines .
never before has dry , economic news been celebrated so widely in india .
the interest of the citizenry in such matters was reminiscent of south korea in the 1980 .
it augurs well for india as it compels politicians to divert some of their attention from politics to economics .
the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .
the fact that it is high does not indicate economic strength and preparedness to respond to emergencies .
rather , it reflects the person 's preference for keeping money in a bank rather than investing it in assets .
indeed , there are economists who argue that india should run down a part of its reserve to increase investment .
order first the other big news was also one where the symbolic value outstripped the actual .
appetite for luxury : a saleswoman shows off costly indian jewels this was the idea floated by indian prime minister vajpayee of a common currency for south asia .
although this is not about to happen , the suggestion shows a level of maturity that political leaders can think in terms of economic co-operation even while political irritants remain .
moreover , the very effort to build such co-operation could serve to reduce the risk of political conflict .
to guarantee long-run strength , the indian government needs to : raise the level of investment -lrb- and that includes investment in people -rrb- make a fetish of efficiency make it easier for new private firms to start up business .
india 's investment rate has remained virtually stationary at 24 % -lrb- with a slight fall in the last three years -rrb- .
a sustained growth rate of over 8 % will not be possible unless the investment rate rises to 30 % .
that , in turn , requires the government to put its fiscal house in order .
sweet subsidies on the human side , india has done better than pakistan , but worse than its much poorer eastern neighbour , bangladesh , in many dimensions .
in 1990 , under-5 child mortality -lrb- that is , the number of deaths before age 5 per 1000 children -rrb- was 144 in bangladesh , 128 in pakistan and 123 in india .
by 2001 the numbers were bangladesh 77 , india 93 , and pakistan 109 .
india 's rural poor are still waiting for their share of the economic pie as far as school enrolment of girls as a percentage of boys go , the figure for bangladesh is an exemplary 103 % , whereas for india it is 78 and for pakistan 61 .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
instead , the government must invest more on infrastructure and social improvement .
for the indian government to spend as much as it does - on subsidies and the bureaucracy - and then to wonder why the economy is not growing faster is like my father 's youngest sister who in her old age lamented to me , " i do n't know why i keep such poor health - i eat only sweets . "
click here to return here is a selection of your views about india 's economic prospects .
india has done exceedingly well in the last 10 years .
as the private sector becomes more and more prominant , we should start to see a sharp increase in education levels -lrb- not just literacy rates -rrb- .
this will also mean reduction of government-based jobs and increase in automation in government sectors .
this would lead to decrease in corruption at lower levels of the government .
this will be the true turning point , as people will really start believing in the system that works .
in addition , india will start increasing the infrastructural expenditure as usa did about 30 years ago .
this will turn things around very quickly .
i think india 's true growth is yet to be seen and the next decade or so are set to be very exciting .
sam shrivatsa , usa india , has been doing it the right way , it would be foolish for the country to allow full privatization of foreign businesses in india .
the indian companies are learning from their partnerships and producing a better product .
who wants india to start looking like your local american neighborhood suburban strip mall ?
let them do their thing and watch as it grows .
they have a billion people and the middle class is growing .
u shah , usa much as improved and a lot still needs improvement.it is a big accomplishment for india to come this far .
however , indian governement need to make right kind of changes in the infrastructure of the country so that the growth can be reflected .
jatin batra , usa i recently returned from a month 's vacation in india and confined myself mainly to new delhi , the capital and the state of punjab .
although the economic situatin has definitely improved judging from the lifestyle of acquisition of cars , tvs , computers , foreign cable connections and advanced education in every field especially technology , all these remain in the hands of very few compared to the vast majority who are still entrenched in grind- ing poverty trying to eke out a living from their meagre resources .
india will only be a prosperous society when every level of society enjoys a taste of its economic wealth .
alan e. francis , u.s.a. india has come a long way , but it has a longer way to go .
economic growth has been spurred by one or a few sectors - it and to an extent , services .
but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .
the rural poor are still going without basic food , shelter , sanitation , education and healthcare .
brides are still getting killed for dowry .
in order to have long and sustained growth , the entire socio-economic-political-environmental framework of the country needs to be strengthened , not just bits and pieces of it .
papiya gupta , us it is heartening to see the perceptible change in the mindset of indians .
the solution to corruption and inefficiency is to reduce the role of government and restrict it to providing defence , basic healthcare , infrastructure , and basic education .
in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .
happy new year !
s. ghosal , u.s.a. i feel that india can be optimistic about its economic future - but only parts of india can celebrate ...
i would also argue that the development is taking place in regions .
the north-west -lrb- delhi , harayana , punjab , & rajasthan -rrb- , the south -lrb- all southern states -rrb- the west -lrb- maharashtra and gujarat -rrb- .
apart from these regions , including perhaps southern west bengal , very little headway has been made in economic development ...
for instance , uttar pradesh , bihar & northern west bengal , -rrb- and the north-east - which accounts for almost 1 on every 3 indians - have seen a decline in the general standard of living ... for a real all-india optimism to take place the central government will have to tackle the problem of the lack of development in the north and north-east regions .
bala sinha , uk - birmingham india has finally got its act together particularly by approaching important subjects such as economic development and security with a sense of maturity and responsibility .
i expect india to continue to grow and to develop its infrastructure so that meaningful large scale investment could be attracted .
i was in india earlier this year and one thing i noticed from the previous visit was a considerable attitude change by people in business .
i sincerely expect the saarc region as a whole to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for all people in the region .
in fact , the indicators at the moment are that most countries in south asia are converging their efforts and resources to improve the quality of life of their people .
bernard de livera , canada it is imperative to say that the india 's ' controlled open economy ' policy was the major reason for this impressive economic growth .
while it is true that the real growth benefits have n't yet reached the rural and poor , we have to realise that is not going to happen over-night .
with the involvement of strong fresh minds in every arena of indian growth , i am confident that the nation would be soon be a global economic power .
the next important step for the government should be to categorically eliminate red tapism and corruption at all levels .
umapathy ka , usa i strongly believe that india will be next economic trend setter .
our leadership lacks somebody like a mr lee of singapore or a dr mahathir of malaysia who can take some quick bold decisions .
given the india 's size , culture , potential and values if all goes well india may end up as a happiest superpower for ages to come .
come on india !
sathish murthy , india india is progressing at a rapid pace .
the government however must insure that the wealth is spread to rural india .
india lives in its villages and we can not forget this .
india needs to work on its infrastructure by building modern highways that connect all corners of the country so as to integrate the various peoples of india .
further , if it is possible , corruption has to be stamped out so doing business in india is not hindered by red tape and baksheesh -lrb- bribes -rrb- .
india is now a world powerhouse , but it must insure that it does n't overlook the plight of all its citizens .
a. rastogi , usa i think india is definitely on the right economic road .
the reforms of the 1990s is finally showing results .
there is still a long way to go but at the same time we have come a long way also .
dhurinder bhatwatekar , usa of course india can be very optimistic about its economy .
india 's economy is expected to grow 8 % this year .
it has a mass of skilled workers willing to work for a salary much below the poverty line of america .
it 's power parity is 4th in the world .
it will need to fix labour laws to attract manufacturing industry which can greatly help india 's rural poor .
anil gaddam , usa in my opinion , india is on the threshold of becoming an economic super power .
for this to materialise , india has to boost the growth rate over 8 % , cut subsidies , reduce fiscal deficit , increase investment , eliminate red tape , ramp up efficiency and above all develop human capital .
then in fifteen years time , it will be the economic engine of the world .
swapan , uk / usa .
until the caste system is truly abolished in india , the only people that can look forward to a bright future are the wealthy .
india 's millions of poor people need social change as well as economic success .
alex watson , great britain india needs to quickly shed it 's third world shabby image .
despite the 100b billion reserves look at the perpetual garbage-strewn , unhygienic , filthy and decrepit cities .
india needs to build bottom-up and not merely drive new cars .
john kumar , usa yes i believe india can be optimistic about its economic future .
where india has come from there is only one way to go .
there is a new found awareness and a sense of confidence that we can do it .
the confidence is half the battle .
today 's generation have been brought up in an environment of freedom and democracy ...
gone are the days of nehru-gandhi socialism where the indian state was the leader .
now that the onus is on the indians and they will succeed .
ramesh kadambi , usa yes , i think in the years to come india will be a economic power in the region .
to realise a long term benefit of becoming an economic power india should invest generously in sectors like poverty alleviation , education , research and development .
poverty alleviation and education will lead to better exercising of the democratic values and eventually will pave a way for more number of sensible people to participate in the political front .
right political decisions with sustained economic growth will make india an economic giant .
prashanth , the netherlands india can and should be optimistic about its future growth .
however , the real challenge is to bring about a working social safety network .
at the present this is next to nil .
the way things are going right now , the rich are getting richer , the middle class are experiencing some betterment , but the growth is not trickling down to the poorest .
madhukar tomar , india / uk growth is evident and is not short-term spike .
the fundamentals of indian economy are indeed becoming better .
industrial efficiency has definitely improved over the past 4-5 years .
more importantly , competition has set in .
when you see consumers gleefully relishing this new-found choice -lrb- so many cable tv channels , so many cell phone providers -rrb- the bargaining power has shifted to consumers from the erstwhile monopolists . ...
what is needed is how to spread these reforms and gains to the social , political , and judicial sectors ?
natarajan ramachandran , india / us i believe india 's economic success is blown out of proportion .
majority of the population is under the poverty line and in the rural sector .
other than a few states such as maharashtra , andhra pradesh , most are stagnant economies .
we can see a rising divide among states in every aspect especially regarding poverty and within a few decades we might we able to a developed and an extremely underdeveloped state side by side in india .
dabu dhabawala , kenya naturally , india in lieu of its position of both economic strength and defence prowess would be the next superpower .
what has to happen is a gradual but certain transformation from a name-sake democracy to an actual functional democracy .
india minus corruption is probably a nightmare for most countries .
ashwin , usa if majority of people are living under poverty line then what is point of having $ 100bn in reserve .
government should invest this reserve to create better infrastructure in the country - better roads , and water & electricity supplies .
the sewage system needs to be upgraded throughout the country .
there should be water network pipe lines so everybody should have access to pure drinking water , better railway and other transport systems .
kn saigal , uk the mindset of the people in india is changing and becoming more west oriented .
when that happens , any country will achieve prosperity , not just india .
however , india will just out compete any challenger and take its place in the world as number 1a if not number one .
chad khanna , canada india has long way to go ... transportation systems are in poor shape .
real estate is in poor shape .
financial systems needs big changes .
infrastructure is primitive .
there is no need to celebrate at this juncture .
sam rupani , usa i 've heard loads about foreign investment in india .
it would be interesting to see how much of this is simply because labour costs are so cheap. e.g. uk telephone call centres .
will this growth just transfer to another developing country when wages start to rise -lrb- particularly if investment in the economy continues to be low -rrb- ?

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university for the indian economy the year 2003 ended on a high - on 20 december , the foreign exchange reserves breached the $ 100bn mark .
fancy shopping malls cater to newly-enriched consumers the year also saw indian companies breaking into the international corporate market , making 35 global acquisitions totalling $ 450m .
thinking internationally , prime minister atal behari vajpayee floated the idea of a common currency for south asia .
and the industrial sector is booming .
car sales in november were 41 % higher than the previous year .
overall , gross domestic product is expected to grow by more than 7 % in the financial year ending in march 2004 .
but it is easy to over-interpret this news .
your views on india 's economic prospects growth challenge a sober analysis indicates that india is continuing to do well , as it has done since 1993 , with 6 % per annum average growth .
boom-time in bombay : record share prices spark a trading frenzy this robustness , combined with the advantage of its size , means that it is a country that global players can not ignore .
but if india is to go beyond this , to a sustained annual growth rate of over 8 % , and with benefits reaching all levels of society , more needs to be done by government than whipping up electoral support by pointing to the headlines .
it is worth remembering that india has seen brief growth spurts before - its growth rate in 1988-89 exceeded 10 % .
the challenge therefore , is to bring about sustained growth .
economic interest consider the $ 100bn foreign exchange -lrb- forex -rrb- news .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
the large reserve points to a good performance by the reserve bank - the reserve was $ 5.83bn in 1991 .
but , in itself , this does not mean as much as the screaming newspaper headlines on 21 december suggested .
what was more significant was the fact that the news made the headlines .
never before has dry , economic news been celebrated so widely in india .
the interest of the citizenry in such matters was reminiscent of south korea in the 1980 .
it augurs well for india as it compels politicians to divert some of their attention from politics to economics .
the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .
the fact that it is high does not indicate economic strength and preparedness to respond to emergencies .
rather , it reflects the person 's preference for keeping money in a bank rather than investing it in assets .
indeed , there are economists who argue that india should run down a part of its reserve to increase investment .
order first the other big news was also one where the symbolic value outstripped the actual .
appetite for luxury : a saleswoman shows off costly indian jewels this was the idea floated by indian prime minister vajpayee of a common currency for south asia .
although this is not about to happen , the suggestion shows a level of maturity that political leaders can think in terms of economic co-operation even while political irritants remain .
moreover , the very effort to build such co-operation could serve to reduce the risk of political conflict .
to guarantee long-run strength , the indian government needs to : raise the level of investment -lrb- and that includes investment in people -rrb- make a fetish of efficiency make it easier for new private firms to start up business .
india 's investment rate has remained virtually stationary at 24 % -lrb- with a slight fall in the last three years -rrb- .
a sustained growth rate of over 8 % will not be possible unless the investment rate rises to 30 % .
that , in turn , requires the government to put its fiscal house in order .
sweet subsidies on the human side , india has done better than pakistan , but worse than its much poorer eastern neighbour , bangladesh , in many dimensions .
in 1990 , under-5 child mortality -lrb- that is , the number of deaths before age 5 per 1000 children -rrb- was 144 in bangladesh , 128 in pakistan and 123 in india .
by 2001 the numbers were bangladesh 77 , india 93 , and pakistan 109 .
india 's rural poor are still waiting for their share of the economic pie as far as school enrolment of girls as a percentage of boys go , the figure for bangladesh is an exemplary 103 % , whereas for india it is 78 and for pakistan 61 .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
instead , the government must invest more on infrastructure and social improvement .
for the indian government to spend as much as it does - on subsidies and the bureaucracy - and then to wonder why the economy is not growing faster is like my father 's youngest sister who in her old age lamented to me , " i do n't know why i keep such poor health - i eat only sweets . "
click here to return here is a selection of your views about india 's economic prospects .
india has done exceedingly well in the last 10 years .
as the private sector becomes more and more prominant , we should start to see a sharp increase in education levels -lrb- not just literacy rates -rrb- .
this will also mean reduction of government-based jobs and increase in automation in government sectors .
this would lead to decrease in corruption at lower levels of the government .
this will be the true turning point , as people will really start believing in the system that works .
in addition , india will start increasing the infrastructural expenditure as usa did about 30 years ago .
this will turn things around very quickly .
i think india 's true growth is yet to be seen and the next decade or so are set to be very exciting .
sam shrivatsa , usa india , has been doing it the right way , it would be foolish for the country to allow full privatization of foreign businesses in india .
the indian companies are learning from their partnerships and producing a better product .
who wants india to start looking like your local american neighborhood suburban strip mall ?
let them do their thing and watch as it grows .
they have a billion people and the middle class is growing .
u shah , usa much as improved and a lot still needs improvement.it is a big accomplishment for india to come this far .
however , indian governement need to make right kind of changes in the infrastructure of the country so that the growth can be reflected .
jatin batra , usa i recently returned from a month 's vacation in india and confined myself mainly to new delhi , the capital and the state of punjab .
although the economic situatin has definitely improved judging from the lifestyle of acquisition of cars , tvs , computers , foreign cable connections and advanced education in every field especially technology , all these remain in the hands of very few compared to the vast majority who are still entrenched in grind- ing poverty trying to eke out a living from their meagre resources .
india will only be a prosperous society when every level of society enjoys a taste of its economic wealth .
alan e. francis , u.s.a. india has come a long way , but it has a longer way to go .
economic growth has been spurred by one or a few sectors - it and to an extent , services .
but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .
the rural poor are still going without basic food , shelter , sanitation , education and healthcare .
brides are still getting killed for dowry .
in order to have long and sustained growth , the entire socio-economic-political-environmental framework of the country needs to be strengthened , not just bits and pieces of it .
papiya gupta , us it is heartening to see the perceptible change in the mindset of indians .
the solution to corruption and inefficiency is to reduce the role of government and restrict it to providing defence , basic healthcare , infrastructure , and basic education .
in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .
happy new year !
s. ghosal , u.s.a. i feel that india can be optimistic about its economic future - but only parts of india can celebrate ...
i would also argue that the development is taking place in regions .
the north-west -lrb- delhi , harayana , punjab , & rajasthan -rrb- , the south -lrb- all southern states -rrb- the west -lrb- maharashtra and gujarat -rrb- .
apart from these regions , including perhaps southern west bengal , very little headway has been made in economic development ...
for instance , uttar pradesh , bihar & northern west bengal , -rrb- and the north-east - which accounts for almost 1 on every 3 indians - have seen a decline in the general standard of living ... for a real all-india optimism to take place the central government will have to tackle the problem of the lack of development in the north and north-east regions .
bala sinha , uk - birmingham india has finally got its act together particularly by approaching important subjects such as economic development and security with a sense of maturity and responsibility .
i expect india to continue to grow and to develop its infrastructure so that meaningful large scale investment could be attracted .
i was in india earlier this year and one thing i noticed from the previous visit was a considerable attitude change by people in business .
i sincerely expect the saarc region as a whole to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for all people in the region .
in fact , the indicators at the moment are that most countries in south asia are converging their efforts and resources to improve the quality of life of their people .
bernard de livera , canada it is imperative to say that the india 's ' controlled open economy ' policy was the major reason for this impressive economic growth .
while it is true that the real growth benefits have n't yet reached the rural and poor , we have to realise that is not going to happen over-night .
with the involvement of strong fresh minds in every arena of indian growth , i am confident that the nation would be soon be a global economic power .
the next important step for the government should be to categorically eliminate red tapism and corruption at all levels .
umapathy ka , usa i strongly believe that india will be next economic trend setter .
our leadership lacks somebody like a mr lee of singapore or a dr mahathir of malaysia who can take some quick bold decisions .
given the india 's size , culture , potential and values if all goes well india may end up as a happiest superpower for ages to come .
come on india !
sathish murthy , india india is progressing at a rapid pace .
the government however must insure that the wealth is spread to rural india .
india lives in its villages and we can not forget this .
india needs to work on its infrastructure by building modern highways that connect all corners of the country so as to integrate the various peoples of india .
further , if it is possible , corruption has to be stamped out so doing business in india is not hindered by red tape and baksheesh -lrb- bribes -rrb- .
india is now a world powerhouse , but it must insure that it does n't overlook the plight of all its citizens .
a. rastogi , usa i think india is definitely on the right economic road .
the reforms of the 1990s is finally showing results .
there is still a long way to go but at the same time we have come a long way also .
dhurinder bhatwatekar , usa of course india can be very optimistic about its economy .
india 's economy is expected to grow 8 % this year .
it has a mass of skilled workers willing to work for a salary much below the poverty line of america .
it 's power parity is 4th in the world .
it will need to fix labour laws to attract manufacturing industry which can greatly help india 's rural poor .
anil gaddam , usa in my opinion , india is on the threshold of becoming an economic super power .
for this to materialise , india has to boost the growth rate over 8 % , cut subsidies , reduce fiscal deficit , increase investment , eliminate red tape , ramp up efficiency and above all develop human capital .
then in fifteen years time , it will be the economic engine of the world .

but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .
the rural poor are still going without basic food , shelter , sanitation , education and healthcare .
brides are still getting killed for dowry .
in order to have long and sustained growth , the entire socio-economic-political-environmental framework of the country needs to be strengthened , not just bits and pieces of it .
papiya gupta , us it is heartening to see the perceptible change in the mindset of indians .
the solution to corruption and inefficiency is to reduce the role of government and restrict it to providing defence , basic healthcare , infrastructure , and basic education .
in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .
happy new year !
s. ghosal , u.s.a. i feel that india can be optimistic about its economic future - but only parts of india can celebrate ...
i would also argue that the development is taking place in regions .
the north-west -lrb- delhi , harayana , punjab , & rajasthan -rrb- , the south -lrb- all southern states -rrb- the west -lrb- maharashtra and gujarat -rrb- .
apart from these regions , including perhaps southern west bengal , very little headway has been made in economic development ...
for instance , uttar pradesh , bihar & northern west bengal , -rrb- and the north-east - which accounts for almost 1 on every 3 indians - have seen a decline in the general standard of living ... for a real all-india optimism to take place the central government will have to tackle the problem of the lack of development in the north and north-east regions .
bala sinha , uk - birmingham india has finally got its act together particularly by approaching important subjects such as economic development and security with a sense of maturity and responsibility .
i expect india to continue to grow and to develop its infrastructure so that meaningful large scale investment could be attracted .
i was in india earlier this year and one thing i noticed from the previous visit was a considerable attitude change by people in business .
i sincerely expect the saarc region as a whole to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for all people in the region .
in fact , the indicators at the moment are that most countries in south asia are converging their efforts and resources to improve the quality of life of their people .
bernard de livera , canada it is imperative to say that the india 's ' controlled open economy ' policy was the major reason for this impressive economic growth .
while it is true that the real growth benefits have n't yet reached the rural and poor , we have to realise that is not going to happen over-night .
with the involvement of strong fresh minds in every arena of indian growth , i am confident that the nation would be soon be a global economic power .
the next important step for the government should be to categorically eliminate red tapism and corruption at all levels .
umapathy ka , usa i strongly believe that india will be next economic trend setter .
our leadership lacks somebody like a mr lee of singapore or a dr mahathir of malaysia who can take some quick bold decisions .
given the india 's size , culture , potential and values if all goes well india may end up as a happiest superpower for ages to come .
come on india !
sathish murthy , india india is progressing at a rapid pace .
the government however must insure that the wealth is spread to rural india .
india lives in its villages and we can not forget this .
india needs to work on its infrastructure by building modern highways that connect all corners of the country so as to integrate the various peoples of india .
further , if it is possible , corruption has to be stamped out so doing business in india is not hindered by red tape and baksheesh -lrb- bribes -rrb- .
india is now a world powerhouse , but it must insure that it does n't overlook the plight of all its citizens .
a. rastogi , usa i think india is definitely on the right economic road .
the reforms of the 1990s is finally showing results .
there is still a long way to go but at the same time we have come a long way also .
dhurinder bhatwatekar , usa of course india can be very optimistic about its economy .
india 's economy is expected to grow 8 % this year .
it has a mass of skilled workers willing to work for a salary much below the poverty line of america .
it 's power parity is 4th in the world .
it will need to fix labour laws to attract manufacturing industry which can greatly help india 's rural poor .
anil gaddam , usa in my opinion , india is on the threshold of becoming an economic super power .
for this to materialise , india has to boost the growth rate over 8 % , cut subsidies , reduce fiscal deficit , increase investment , eliminate red tape , ramp up efficiency and above all develop human capital .
then in fifteen years time , it will be the economic engine of the world .
swapan , uk / usa .
until the caste system is truly abolished in india , the only people that can look forward to a bright future are the wealthy .
india 's millions of poor people need social change as well as economic success .
alex watson , great britain india needs to quickly shed it 's third world shabby image .
despite the 100b billion reserves look at the perpetual garbage-strewn , unhygienic , filthy and decrepit cities .
india needs to build bottom-up and not merely drive new cars .
john kumar , usa yes i believe india can be optimistic about its economic future .
where india has come from there is only one way to go .
there is a new found awareness and a sense of confidence that we can do it .
the confidence is half the battle .
today 's generation have been brought up in an environment of freedom and democracy ...
gone are the days of nehru-gandhi socialism where the indian state was the leader .
now that the onus is on the indians and they will succeed .
ramesh kadambi , usa yes , i think in the years to come india will be a economic power in the region .
to realise a long term benefit of becoming an economic power india should invest generously in sectors like poverty alleviation , education , research and development .
poverty alleviation and education will lead to better exercising of the democratic values and eventually will pave a way for more number of sensible people to participate in the political front .
right political decisions with sustained economic growth will make india an economic giant .
prashanth , the netherlands india can and should be optimistic about its future growth .
however , the real challenge is to bring about a working social safety network .
at the present this is next to nil .
the way things are going right now , the rich are getting richer , the middle class are experiencing some betterment , but the growth is not trickling down to the poorest .
madhukar tomar , india / uk growth is evident and is not short-term spike .
the fundamentals of indian economy are indeed becoming better .
industrial efficiency has definitely improved over the past 4-5 years .
more importantly , competition has set in .
when you see consumers gleefully relishing this new-found choice -lrb- so many cable tv channels , so many cell phone providers -rrb- the bargaining power has shifted to consumers from the erstwhile monopolists . ...
what is needed is how to spread these reforms and gains to the social , political , and judicial sectors ?
natarajan ramachandran , india / us i believe india 's economic success is blown out of proportion .
majority of the population is under the poverty line and in the rural sector .
other than a few states such as maharashtra , andhra pradesh , most are stagnant economies .
we can see a rising divide among states in every aspect especially regarding poverty and within a few decades we might we able to a developed and an extremely underdeveloped state side by side in india .
dabu dhabawala , kenya naturally , india in lieu of its position of both economic strength and defence prowess would be the next superpower .
what has to happen is a gradual but certain transformation from a name-sake democracy to an actual functional democracy .
india minus corruption is probably a nightmare for most countries .
ashwin , usa if majority of people are living under poverty line then what is point of having $ 100bn in reserve .
government should invest this reserve to create better infrastructure in the country - better roads , and water & electricity supplies .
the sewage system needs to be upgraded throughout the country .
there should be water network pipe lines so everybody should have access to pure drinking water , better railway and other transport systems .
kn saigal , uk the mindset of the people in india is changing and becoming more west oriented .
when that happens , any country will achieve prosperity , not just india .
however , india will just out compete any challenger and take its place in the world as number 1a if not number one .
chad khanna , canada india has long way to go ... transportation systems are in poor shape .
real estate is in poor shape .
financial systems needs big changes .
infrastructure is primitive .
there is no need to celebrate at this juncture .
sam rupani , usa i 've heard loads about foreign investment in india .
it would be interesting to see how much of this is simply because labour costs are so cheap. e.g. uk telephone call centres .
will this growth just transfer to another developing country when wages start to rise -lrb- particularly if investment in the economy continues to be low -rrb- ?

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university for the indian economy the year 2003 ended on a high - on 20 december , the foreign exchange reserves breached the $ 100bn mark .
fancy shopping malls cater to newly-enriched consumers the year also saw indian companies breaking into the international corporate market , making 35 global acquisitions totalling $ 450m .
thinking internationally , prime minister atal behari vajpayee floated the idea of a common currency for south asia .
and the industrial sector is booming .
car sales in november were 41 % higher than the previous year .
overall , gross domestic product is expected to grow by more than 7 % in the financial year ending in march 2004 .
but it is easy to over-interpret this news .
your views on india 's economic prospects growth challenge a sober analysis indicates that india is continuing to do well , as it has done since 1993 , with 6 % per annum average growth .
boom-time in bombay : record share prices spark a trading frenzy this robustness , combined with the advantage of its size , means that it is a country that global players can not ignore .
but if india is to go beyond this , to a sustained annual growth rate of over 8 % , and with benefits reaching all levels of society , more needs to be done by government than whipping up electoral support by pointing to the headlines .
it is worth remembering that india has seen brief growth spurts before - its growth rate in 1988-89 exceeded 10 % .
the challenge therefore , is to bring about sustained growth .
economic interest consider the $ 100bn foreign exchange -lrb- forex -rrb- news .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
the large reserve points to a good performance by the reserve bank - the reserve was $ 5.83bn in 1991 .
but , in itself , this does not mean as much as the screaming newspaper headlines on 21 december suggested .
what was more significant was the fact that the news made the headlines .
never before has dry , economic news been celebrated so widely in india .
the interest of the citizenry in such matters was reminiscent of south korea in the 1980 .
it augurs well for india as it compels politicians to divert some of their attention from politics to economics .
the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .
the fact that it is high does not indicate economic strength and preparedness to respond to emergencies .
rather , it reflects the person 's preference for keeping money in a bank rather than investing it in assets .
indeed , there are economists who argue that india should run down a part of its reserve to increase investment .
order first the other big news was also one where the symbolic value outstripped the actual .
appetite for luxury : a saleswoman shows off costly indian jewels this was the idea floated by indian prime minister vajpayee of a common currency for south asia .
although this is not about to happen , the suggestion shows a level of maturity that political leaders can think in terms of economic co-operation even while political irritants remain .
moreover , the very effort to build such co-operation could serve to reduce the risk of political conflict .
to guarantee long-run strength , the indian government needs to : raise the level of investment -lrb- and that includes investment in people -rrb- make a fetish of efficiency make it easier for new private firms to start up business .
india 's investment rate has remained virtually stationary at 24 % -lrb- with a slight fall in the last three years -rrb- .
a sustained growth rate of over 8 % will not be possible unless the investment rate rises to 30 % .
that , in turn , requires the government to put its fiscal house in order .
sweet subsidies on the human side , india has done better than pakistan , but worse than its much poorer eastern neighbour , bangladesh , in many dimensions .
in 1990 , under-5 child mortality -lrb- that is , the number of deaths before age 5 per 1000 children -rrb- was 144 in bangladesh , 128 in pakistan and 123 in india .
by 2001 the numbers were bangladesh 77 , india 93 , and pakistan 109 .
india 's rural poor are still waiting for their share of the economic pie as far as school enrolment of girls as a percentage of boys go , the figure for bangladesh is an exemplary 103 % , whereas for india it is 78 and for pakistan 61 .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
instead , the government must invest more on infrastructure and social improvement .
for the indian government to spend as much as it does - on subsidies and the bureaucracy - and then to wonder why the economy is not growing faster is like my father 's youngest sister who in her old age lamented to me , " i do n't know why i keep such poor health - i eat only sweets . "
click here to return here is a selection of your views about india 's economic prospects .
india has done exceedingly well in the last 10 years .
as the private sector becomes more and more prominant , we should start to see a sharp increase in education levels -lrb- not just literacy rates -rrb- .
this will also mean reduction of government-based jobs and increase in automation in government sectors .
this would lead to decrease in corruption at lower levels of the government .
this will be the true turning point , as people will really start believing in the system that works .
in addition , india will start increasing the infrastructural expenditure as usa did about 30 years ago .
this will turn things around very quickly .
i think india 's true growth is yet to be seen and the next decade or so are set to be very exciting .
sam shrivatsa , usa india , has been doing it the right way , it would be foolish for the country to allow full privatization of foreign businesses in india .
the indian companies are learning from their partnerships and producing a better product .
who wants india to start looking like your local american neighborhood suburban strip mall ?
let them do their thing and watch as it grows .
they have a billion people and the middle class is growing .
u shah , usa much as improved and a lot still needs improvement.it is a big accomplishment for india to come this far .
however , indian governement need to make right kind of changes in the infrastructure of the country so that the growth can be reflected .
jatin batra , usa i recently returned from a month 's vacation in india and confined myself mainly to new delhi , the capital and the state of punjab .
although the economic situatin has definitely improved judging from the lifestyle of acquisition of cars , tvs , computers , foreign cable connections and advanced education in every field especially technology , all these remain in the hands of very few compared to the vast majority who are still entrenched in grind- ing poverty trying to eke out a living from their meagre resources .
india will only be a prosperous society when every level of society enjoys a taste of its economic wealth .
alan e. francis , u.s.a. india has come a long way , but it has a longer way to go .
economic growth has been spurred by one or a few sectors - it and to an extent , services .
but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .

in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .

the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .
the fact that it is high does not indicate economic strength and preparedness to respond to emergencies .
rather , it reflects the person 's preference for keeping money in a bank rather than investing it in assets .
indeed , there are economists who argue that india should run down a part of its reserve to increase investment .
order first the other big news was also one where the symbolic value outstripped the actual .
appetite for luxury : a saleswoman shows off costly indian jewels this was the idea floated by indian prime minister vajpayee of a common currency for south asia .
although this is not about to happen , the suggestion shows a level of maturity that political leaders can think in terms of economic co-operation even while political irritants remain .
moreover , the very effort to build such co-operation could serve to reduce the risk of political conflict .
to guarantee long-run strength , the indian government needs to : raise the level of investment -lrb- and that includes investment in people -rrb- make a fetish of efficiency make it easier for new private firms to start up business .
india 's investment rate has remained virtually stationary at 24 % -lrb- with a slight fall in the last three years -rrb- .
a sustained growth rate of over 8 % will not be possible unless the investment rate rises to 30 % .
that , in turn , requires the government to put its fiscal house in order .
sweet subsidies on the human side , india has done better than pakistan , but worse than its much poorer eastern neighbour , bangladesh , in many dimensions .
in 1990 , under-5 child mortality -lrb- that is , the number of deaths before age 5 per 1000 children -rrb- was 144 in bangladesh , 128 in pakistan and 123 in india .
by 2001 the numbers were bangladesh 77 , india 93 , and pakistan 109 .
india 's rural poor are still waiting for their share of the economic pie as far as school enrolment of girls as a percentage of boys go , the figure for bangladesh is an exemplary 103 % , whereas for india it is 78 and for pakistan 61 .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
instead , the government must invest more on infrastructure and social improvement .
for the indian government to spend as much as it does - on subsidies and the bureaucracy - and then to wonder why the economy is not growing faster is like my father 's youngest sister who in her old age lamented to me , " i do n't know why i keep such poor health - i eat only sweets . "
click here to return here is a selection of your views about india 's economic prospects .
india has done exceedingly well in the last 10 years .
as the private sector becomes more and more prominant , we should start to see a sharp increase in education levels -lrb- not just literacy rates -rrb- .
this will also mean reduction of government-based jobs and increase in automation in government sectors .
this would lead to decrease in corruption at lower levels of the government .
this will be the true turning point , as people will really start believing in the system that works .
in addition , india will start increasing the infrastructural expenditure as usa did about 30 years ago .
this will turn things around very quickly .
i think india 's true growth is yet to be seen and the next decade or so are set to be very exciting .
sam shrivatsa , usa india , has been doing it the right way , it would be foolish for the country to allow full privatization of foreign businesses in india .
the indian companies are learning from their partnerships and producing a better product .
who wants india to start looking like your local american neighborhood suburban strip mall ?
let them do their thing and watch as it grows .
they have a billion people and the middle class is growing .
u shah , usa much as improved and a lot still needs improvement.it is a big accomplishment for india to come this far .
however , indian governement need to make right kind of changes in the infrastructure of the country so that the growth can be reflected .
jatin batra , usa i recently returned from a month 's vacation in india and confined myself mainly to new delhi , the capital and the state of punjab .
although the economic situatin has definitely improved judging from the lifestyle of acquisition of cars , tvs , computers , foreign cable connections and advanced education in every field especially technology , all these remain in the hands of very few compared to the vast majority who are still entrenched in grind- ing poverty trying to eke out a living from their meagre resources .
india will only be a prosperous society when every level of society enjoys a taste of its economic wealth .
alan e. francis , u.s.a. india has come a long way , but it has a longer way to go .
economic growth has been spurred by one or a few sectors - it and to an extent , services .
but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .
the rural poor are still going without basic food , shelter , sanitation , education and healthcare .
brides are still getting killed for dowry .
in order to have long and sustained growth , the entire socio-economic-political-environmental framework of the country needs to be strengthened , not just bits and pieces of it .
papiya gupta , us it is heartening to see the perceptible change in the mindset of indians .
the solution to corruption and inefficiency is to reduce the role of government and restrict it to providing defence , basic healthcare , infrastructure , and basic education .
in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .
happy new year !
s. ghosal , u.s.a. i feel that india can be optimistic about its economic future - but only parts of india can celebrate ...
i would also argue that the development is taking place in regions .
the north-west -lrb- delhi , harayana , punjab , & rajasthan -rrb- , the south -lrb- all southern states -rrb- the west -lrb- maharashtra and gujarat -rrb- .
apart from these regions , including perhaps southern west bengal , very little headway has been made in economic development ...
for instance , uttar pradesh , bihar & northern west bengal , -rrb- and the north-east - which accounts for almost 1 on every 3 indians - have seen a decline in the general standard of living ... for a real all-india optimism to take place the central government will have to tackle the problem of the lack of development in the north and north-east regions .
bala sinha , uk - birmingham india has finally got its act together particularly by approaching important subjects such as economic development and security with a sense of maturity and responsibility .
i expect india to continue to grow and to develop its infrastructure so that meaningful large scale investment could be attracted .
i was in india earlier this year and one thing i noticed from the previous visit was a considerable attitude change by people in business .
i sincerely expect the saarc region as a whole to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for all people in the region .
in fact , the indicators at the moment are that most countries in south asia are converging their efforts and resources to improve the quality of life of their people .
bernard de livera , canada it is imperative to say that the india 's ' controlled open economy ' policy was the major reason for this impressive economic growth .
while it is true that the real growth benefits have n't yet reached the rural and poor , we have to realise that is not going to happen over-night .
with the involvement of strong fresh minds in every arena of indian growth , i am confident that the nation would be soon be a global economic power .
the next important step for the government should be to categorically eliminate red tapism and corruption at all levels .
umapathy ka , usa i strongly believe that india will be next economic trend setter .
our leadership lacks somebody like a mr lee of singapore or a dr mahathir of malaysia who can take some quick bold decisions .
given the india 's size , culture , potential and values if all goes well india may end up as a happiest superpower for ages to come .
come on india !
sathish murthy , india india is progressing at a rapid pace .
the government however must insure that the wealth is spread to rural india .
india lives in its villages and we can not forget this .
india needs to work on its infrastructure by building modern highways that connect all corners of the country so as to integrate the various peoples of india .
further , if it is possible , corruption has to be stamped out so doing business in india is not hindered by red tape and baksheesh -lrb- bribes -rrb- .
india is now a world powerhouse , but it must insure that it does n't overlook the plight of all its citizens .
a. rastogi , usa i think india is definitely on the right economic road .
the reforms of the 1990s is finally showing results .
there is still a long way to go but at the same time we have come a long way also .
dhurinder bhatwatekar , usa of course india can be very optimistic about its economy .
india 's economy is expected to grow 8 % this year .
it has a mass of skilled workers willing to work for a salary much below the poverty line of america .
it 's power parity is 4th in the world .
it will need to fix labour laws to attract manufacturing industry which can greatly help india 's rural poor .
anil gaddam , usa in my opinion , india is on the threshold of becoming an economic super power .
for this to materialise , india has to boost the growth rate over 8 % , cut subsidies , reduce fiscal deficit , increase investment , eliminate red tape , ramp up efficiency and above all develop human capital .
then in fifteen years time , it will be the economic engine of the world .

john kumar , usa yes i believe india can be optimistic about its economic future .
where india has come from there is only one way to go .

now that the onus is on the indians and they will succeed .
ramesh kadambi , usa yes , i think in the years to come india will be a economic power in the region .
to realise a long term benefit of becoming an economic power india should invest generously in sectors like poverty alleviation , education , research and development .
poverty alleviation and education will lead to better exercising of the democratic values and eventually will pave a way for more number of sensible people to participate in the political front .
right political decisions with sustained economic growth will make india an economic giant .

what is needed is how to spread these reforms and gains to the social , political , and judicial sectors ?
natarajan ramachandran , india / us i believe india 's economic success is blown out of proportion .
majority of the population is under the poverty line and in the rural sector .
other than a few states such as maharashtra , andhra pradesh , most are stagnant economies .
we can see a rising divide among states in every aspect especially regarding poverty and within a few decades we might we able to a developed and an extremely underdeveloped state side by side in india .
dabu dhabawala , kenya naturally , india in lieu of its position of both economic strength and defence prowess would be the next superpower .

india minus corruption is probably a nightmare for most countries .
ashwin , usa if majority of people are living under poverty line then what is point of having $ 100bn in reserve .
government should invest this reserve to create better infrastructure in the country - better roads , and water & electricity supplies .
the sewage system needs to be upgraded throughout the country .
there should be water network pipe lines so everybody should have access to pure drinking water , better railway and other transport systems .
kn saigal , uk the mindset of the people in india is changing and becoming more west oriented .
when that happens , any country will achieve prosperity , not just india .

there is no need to celebrate at this juncture .
sam rupani , usa i 've heard loads about foreign investment in india .
it would be interesting to see how much of this is simply because labour costs are so cheap. e.g. uk telephone call centres .

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university for the indian economy the year 2003 ended on a high - on 20 december , the foreign exchange reserves breached the $ 100bn mark .
fancy shopping malls cater to newly-enriched consumers the year also saw indian companies breaking into the international corporate market , making 35 global acquisitions totalling $ 450m .
thinking internationally , prime minister atal behari vajpayee floated the idea of a common currency for south asia .
and the industrial sector is booming .
car sales in november were 41 % higher than the previous year .
overall , gross domestic product is expected to grow by more than 7 % in the financial year ending in march 2004 .
but it is easy to over-interpret this news .
your views on india 's economic prospects growth challenge a sober analysis indicates that india is continuing to do well , as it has done since 1993 , with 6 % per annum average growth .
boom-time in bombay : record share prices spark a trading frenzy this robustness , combined with the advantage of its size , means that it is a country that global players can not ignore .
but if india is to go beyond this , to a sustained annual growth rate of over 8 % , and with benefits reaching all levels of society , more needs to be done by government than whipping up electoral support by pointing to the headlines .
it is worth remembering that india has seen brief growth spurts before - its growth rate in 1988-89 exceeded 10 % .
the challenge therefore , is to bring about sustained growth .
economic interest consider the $ 100bn foreign exchange -lrb- forex -rrb- news .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
the large reserve points to a good performance by the reserve bank - the reserve was $ 5.83bn in 1991 .
but , in itself , this does not mean as much as the screaming newspaper headlines on 21 december suggested .
what was more significant was the fact that the news made the headlines .
never before has dry , economic news been celebrated so widely in india .
the interest of the citizenry in such matters was reminiscent of south korea in the 1980 .
it augurs well for india as it compels politicians to divert some of their attention from politics to economics .
the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- india 's economy : can the boom last ?
bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 7 january , 2004 , 08:46 gmt india 's economy : can the boom last ?
by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university for the indian economy the year 2003 ended on a high - on 20 december , the foreign exchange reserves breached the $ 100bn mark .
the year also saw indian companies breaking into the international corporate market , making 35 global acquisitions totalling $ 450m .
thinking internationally , prime minister atal behari vajpayee floated the idea of a common currency for south asia .
and the industrial sector is booming .
car sales in november were 41 % higher than the previous year .
overall , gross domestic product is expected to grow by more than 7 % in the financial year ending in march 2004 .
but it is easy to over-interpret this news .
growth challenge a sober analysis indicates that india is continuing to do well , as it has done since 1993 , with 6 % per annum average growth .
this robustness , combined with the advantage of its size , means that it is a country that global players can not ignore .
but if india is to go beyond this , to a sustained annual growth rate of over 8 % , and with benefits reaching all levels of society , more needs to be done by government than whipping up electoral support by pointing to the headlines .
it is worth remembering that india has seen brief growth spurts before - its growth rate in 1988-89 exceeded 10 % .
the challenge therefore , is to bring about sustained growth .
economic interest consider the $ 100bn foreign exchange -lrb- forex -rrb- news . "
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity . "
the large reserve points to a good performance by the reserve bank - the reserve was $ 5.83bn in 1991 .
but , in itself , this does not mean as much as the screaming newspaper headlines on 21 december suggested .
what was more significant was the fact that the news made the headlines .
never before has dry , economic news been celebrated so widely in india .
the interest of the citizenry in such matters was reminiscent of south korea in the 1980 .
it augurs well for india as it compels politicians to divert some of their attention from politics to economics .
the forex reserve of a government is like an individual 's bank balance .
the fact that it is high does not indicate economic strength and preparedness to respond to emergencies .
rather , it reflects the person 's preference for keeping money in a bank rather than investing it in assets .
indeed , there are economists who argue that india should run down a part of its reserve to increase investment .
order first the other big news was also one where the symbolic value outstripped the actual .
this was the idea floated by indian prime minister vajpayee of a common currency for south asia .
although this is not about to happen , the suggestion shows a level of maturity that political leaders can think in terms of economic co-operation even while political irritants remain .
moreover , the very effort to build such co-operation could serve to reduce the risk of political conflict .
to guarantee long-run strength , the indian government needs to : raise the level of investment -lrb- and that includes investment in people -rrb- make a fetish of efficiency make it easier for new private firms to start up business .
india 's investment rate has remained virtually stationary at 24 % -lrb- with a slight fall in the last three years -rrb- .
a sustained growth rate of over 8 % will not be possible unless the investment rate rises to 30 % .
that , in turn , requires the government to put its fiscal house in order .
sweet subsidies on the human side , india has done better than pakistan , but worse than its much poorer eastern neighbour , bangladesh , in many dimensions .
in 1990 , under-5 child mortality -lrb- that is , the number of deaths before age 5 per 1000 children -rrb- was 144 in bangladesh , 128 in pakistan and 123 in india .
by 2001 the numbers were bangladesh 77 , india 93 , and pakistan 109 .
as far as school enrolment of girls as a percentage of boys go , the figure for bangladesh is an exemplary 103 % , whereas for india it is 78 and for pakistan 61 .
india is a potential global economic power .
but for that potential to be realised , its promise must not be treated as an instrument of short-term electoral popularity .
instead , the government must invest more on infrastructure and social improvement .
for the indian government to spend as much as it does - on subsidies and the bureaucracy - and then to wonder why the economy is not growing faster is like my father 's youngest sister who in her old age lamented to me , " i do n't know why i keep such poor health - i eat only sweets . "
here is a selection of your views about india 's economic prospects .
india has done exceedingly well in the last 10 years .
as the private sector becomes more and more prominant , we should start to see a sharp increase in education levels -lrb- not just literacy rates -rrb- .
this will also mean reduction of government-based jobs and increase in automation in government sectors .
this would lead to decrease in corruption at lower levels of the government .
this will be the true turning point , as people will really start believing in the system that works .
in addition , india will start increasing the infrastructural expenditure as usa did about 30 years ago .
this will turn things around very quickly .
i think india 's true growth is yet to be seen and the next decade or so are set to be very exciting .
sam shrivatsa , usa india , has been doing it the right way , it would be foolish for the country to allow full privatization of foreign businesses in india .
the indian companies are learning from their partnerships and producing a better product .
who wants india to start looking like your local american neighborhood suburban strip mall ?
let them do their thing and watch as it grows .
they have a billion people and the middle class is growing .
u shah , usa much as improved and a lot still needs improvement.it is a big accomplishment for india to come this far .
however , indian governement need to make right kind of changes in the infrastructure of the country so that the growth can be reflected .
jatin batra , usa i recently returned from a month 's vacation in india and confined myself mainly to new delhi , the capital and the state of punjab .
although the economic situatin has definitely improved judging from the lifestyle of acquisition of cars , tvs , computers , foreign cable connections and advanced education in every field especially technology , all these remain in the hands of very few compared to the vast majority who are still entrenched in grind- ing poverty trying to eke out a living from their meagre resources .
india will only be a prosperous society when every level of society enjoys a taste of its economic wealth .
alan e. francis , u.s.a. india has come a long way , but it has a longer way to go .
economic growth has been spurred by one or a few sectors - it and to an extent , services .
but balanced growth and prosperity across all sectors and all levels of society is conspicious by its absence .
though a few states like karnataka , ap , mh , punjab / haryana , kerala , tn and gujarat are way ahead of the pack , most states -lrb- typically highly populated ones -rrb- are still struggling with corruption , bribery , red tapism , poor infrastructure , unemployment , a crumbling bureaucracy , and a general attitude of fatalism .
the rural poor are still going without basic food , shelter , sanitation , education and healthcare .
brides are still getting killed for dowry .
in order to have long and sustained growth , the entire socio-economic-political-environmental framework of the country needs to be strengthened , not just bits and pieces of it .
papiya gupta , us it is heartening to see the perceptible change in the mindset of indians .
the solution to corruption and inefficiency is to reduce the role of government and restrict it to providing defence , basic healthcare , infrastructure , and basic education .
in fifty years of independence , the indian government has tried to meddle in everything it should n't , and done very poorly in everything it should do .
let a million businesses bloom and a billion people prosper .
happy new year !
s. ghosal , u.s.a. i feel that india can be optimistic about its economic future - but only parts of india can celebrate ...
i would also argue that the development is taking place in regions .
the north-west -lrb- delhi , harayana , punjab , & rajasthan -rrb- , the south -lrb- all southern states -rrb- the west -lrb- maharashtra and gujarat -rrb- .
apart from these regions , including perhaps southern west bengal , very little headway has been made in economic development ...
for instance , uttar pradesh , bihar & northern west bengal , -rrb- and the north-east - which accounts for almost 1 on every 3 indians - have seen a decline in the general standard of living ... for a real all-india optimism to take place the central government will have to tackle the problem of the lack of development in the north and north-east regions .
bala sinha , uk - birmingham india has finally got its act together particularly by approaching important subjects such as economic development and security with a sense of maturity and responsibility .
i expect india to continue to grow and to develop its infrastructure so that meaningful large scale investment could be attracted .
i was in india earlier this year and one thing i noticed from the previous visit was a considerable attitude change by people in business .
i sincerely expect the saarc region as a whole to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for all people in the region .
in fact , the indicators at the moment are that most countries in south asia are converging their efforts and resources to improve the quality of life of their people .
bernard de livera , canada it is imperative to say that the india 's ' controlled open economy ' policy was the major reason for this impressive economic growth .
while it is true that the real growth benefits have n't yet reached the rural and poor , we have to realise that is not going to happen over-night .
with the involvement of strong fresh minds in every arena of indian growth , i am confident that the nation would be soon be a global economic power .
the next important step for the government should be to categorically eliminate red tapism and corruption at all levels .
umapathy ka , usa i strongly believe that india will be next economic trend setter .
our leadership lacks somebody like a mr lee of singapore or a dr mahathir of malaysia who can take some quick bold decisions .
given the india 's size , culture , potential and values if all goes well india may end up as a happiest superpower for ages to come .
come on india !
sathish murthy , india india is progressing at a rapid pace .
the government however must insure that the wealth is spread to rural india .
india lives in its villages and we can not forget this .
india needs to work on its infrastructure by building modern highways that connect all corners of the country so as to integrate the various peoples of india .
further , if it is possible , corruption has to be stamped out so doing business in india is not hindered by red tape and baksheesh -lrb- bribes -rrb- .
india is now a world powerhouse , but it must insure that it does n't overlook the plight of all its citizens .
a. rastogi , usa i think india is definitely on the right economic road .
the reforms of the 1990s is finally showing results .
there is still a long way to go but at the same time we have come a long way also .
dhurinder bhatwatekar , usa of course india can be very optimistic about its economy .
india 's economy is expected to grow 8 % this year .
it has a mass of skilled workers willing to work for a salary much below the poverty line of america .
it 's power parity is 4th in the world .
it will need to fix labour laws to attract manufacturing industry which can greatly help india 's rural poor .
anil gaddam , usa in my opinion , india is on the threshold of becoming an economic super power .
for this to materialise , india has to boost the growth rate over 8 % , cut subsidies , reduce fiscal deficit , increase investment , eliminate red tape , ramp up efficiency and above all develop human capital .
then in fifteen years time , it will be the economic engine of the world .
swapan , uk / usa .
until the caste system is truly abolished in india , the only people that can look forward to a bright future are the wealthy .
india 's millions of poor people need social change as well as economic success .
alex watson , great britain india needs to quickly shed it 's third world shabby image .
despite the 100b billion reserves look at the perpetual garbage-strewn , unhygienic , filthy and decrepit cities .
india needs to build bottom-up and not merely drive new cars .
john kumar , usa yes i believe india can be optimistic about its economic future .
where india has come from there is only one way to go .
there is a new found awareness and a sense of confidence that we can do it .
the confidence is half the battle .
today 's generation have been brought up in an environment of freedom and democracy ...
gone are the days of nehru-gandhi socialism where the indian state was the leader .
now that the onus is on the indians and they will succeed .
ramesh kadambi , usa yes , i think in the years to come india will be a economic power in the region .
to realise a long term benefit of becoming an economic power india should invest generously in sectors like poverty alleviation , education , research and development .
poverty alleviation and education will lead to better exercising of the democratic values and eventually will pave a way for more number of sensible people to participate in the political front .
right political decisions with sustained economic growth will make india an economic giant .
prashanth , the netherlands india can and should be optimistic about its future growth .
however , the real challenge is to bring about a working social safety network .
at the present this is next to nil .
the way things are going right now , the rich are getting richer , the middle class are experiencing some betterment , but the growth is not trickling down to the poorest .
madhukar tomar , india / uk growth is evident and is not short-term spike .
the fundamentals of indian economy are indeed becoming better .
industrial efficiency has definitely improved over the past 4-5 years .
more importantly , competition has set in .
when you see consumers gleefully relishing this new-found choice -lrb- so many cable tv channels , so many cell phone providers -rrb- the bargaining power has shifted to consumers from the erstwhile monopolists . ...
what is needed is how to spread these reforms and gains to the social , political , and judicial sectors ?
natarajan ramachandran , india / us i believe india 's economic success is blown out of proportion .
majority of the population is under the poverty line and in the rural sector .
other than a few states such as maharashtra , andhra pradesh , most are stagnant economies .
we can see a rising divide among states in every aspect especially regarding poverty and within a few decades we might we able to a developed and an extremely underdeveloped state side by side in india .
dabu dhabawala , kenya naturally , india in lieu of its position of both economic strength and defence prowess would be the next superpower .
what has to happen is a gradual but certain transformation from a name-sake democracy to an actual functional democracy .
india minus corruption is probably a nightmare for most countries .
ashwin , usa if majority of people are living under poverty line then what is point of having $ 100bn in reserve .
government should invest this reserve to create better infrastructure in the country - better roads , and water & electricity supplies .
the sewage system needs to be upgraded throughout the country .
there should be water network pipe lines so everybody should have access to pure drinking water , better railway and other transport systems .
kn saigal , uk the mindset of the people in india is changing and becoming more west oriented .
when that happens , any country will achieve prosperity , not just india .
however , india will just out compete any challenger and take its place in the world as number 1a if not number one .
chad khanna , canada india has long way to go ... transportation systems are in poor shape .
real estate is in poor shape .
financial systems needs big changes .
infrastructure is primitive .
there is no need to celebrate at this juncture .
sam rupani , usa i 've heard loads about foreign investment in india .
it would be interesting to see how much of this is simply because labour costs are so cheap. e.g. uk telephone call centres .
will this growth just transfer to another developing country when wages start to rise -lrb- particularly if investment in the economy continues to be low -rrb- ?

according to the data from the ministry of information industry , subscriber numbers were up by more than 30 % in 2003 to 269 million .
over the same period , the number of fixed-line phones rose to 263 million in a population of 1.3 billion people .
the rapid growth mirrors the mobile 's explosive growth in europe in the 1990s - although there landlines were already much more common .
growth in china has slowed sharply from the 60 % annual subscriber expansion seen in 2002 , but analysts say the size of the urban market still offers room for solid growth in years to come .
prices for both handsets and services offered by the two state companies controlling the market , china mobile and china unicom , have been falling steadily , as indigenous handset vendors challenge foreign giants such as nokia and motorola .
movement for china , the landline figures may be flattered by the existence of so-called " limited mobility " systems , which allow subscribers to use a cordless handset within a short distance of their homes .
of the 23 % growth in landlines in 2003 , as many as half are thought to be using this service , sold by the state fixed-line duopoly of china telecom and china netcom .
worldwide , the number of mobile users outstripped the number of fixed lines in 2002 .
the shifting balance was largely driven by the popularity of mobiles in developing countries whose landline infrastructure has been held back , often by corrupt or inefficient monopolies .

bbc news online looks at the issues surrounding the inquests .
q : what are the questions to be answered about the circumstances of the deaths ?
a : inquests in england and wales are limited fact-finding affairs .
they focus on who the deceased were ; when and where the death occurred ; and how the cause of death arose .
expressions of opinion as to who might be to blame are not allowed .
but mr burgess has asked metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens to lead an inquiry into the crash , to examine whether any findings may have a bearing on the inquest .
the move came as the daily mirror reported princess diana had written a letter before her death claiming prince charles was behind a plot to kill her .
q : will the coroner take the letter by princess diana into account ?
the coroner has said he wants to see any material that could be significant to the inquiry , and that letter could be such a document .
but many eyebrows have been raised about the claims made in the letter .
" the fact that evidently prince charles is named ...
i think most people would find to be incredible and it would reduce the credibility of that letter , " said bbc royal correspondent nicholas witchell .
q : is the inquest likely to end speculation over princess diana 's death ?
a : this coroner is very aware that this inquest needs to be comprehensive and definitive .
he is facing head-on the speculation and conspiracy theories , by asking the metropolitan police to investigate if there are any grounds for such rumours .
q : is an inquest likely to satisfy all mohamed al fayed 's concerns ?

bbc news online looks at the issues surrounding the inquests .
q : what are the questions to be answered about the circumstances of the deaths ?
a : inquests in england and wales are limited fact-finding affairs .
they focus on who the deceased were ; when and where the death occurred ; and how the cause of death arose .
expressions of opinion as to who might be to blame are not allowed .
but mr burgess has asked metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens to lead an inquiry into the crash , to examine whether any findings may have a bearing on the inquest .
the move came as the daily mirror reported princess diana had written a letter before her death claiming prince charles was behind a plot to kill her .
q : will the coroner take the letter by princess diana into account ?
the coroner has said he wants to see any material that could be significant to the inquiry , and that letter could be such a document .
but many eyebrows have been raised about the claims made in the letter .
" the fact that evidently prince charles is named ...
i think most people would find to be incredible and it would reduce the credibility of that letter , " said bbc royal correspondent nicholas witchell .
q : is the inquest likely to end speculation over princess diana 's death ?
a : this coroner is very aware that this inquest needs to be comprehensive and definitive .
he is facing head-on the speculation and conspiracy theories , by asking the metropolitan police to investigate if there are any grounds for such rumours .
q : is an inquest likely to satisfy all mohamed al fayed 's concerns ?
a : mr al fayed , dodi 's father , has said of the inquest : " this is what we have been waiting for , for six years ...
at last , i hope we can see the light . "
but he has called for a public inquiry into the paris crash , saying the remit of the coroner 's inquest is far too narrow .
q : will the inquest re-open old wounds for the royal family ?
a : the daily mirror 's story and the intense speculation surrounding the death of the princess and mr al fayed will put prince charles under pressure .
it is also likely to prove very distressing for princes william and harry .
