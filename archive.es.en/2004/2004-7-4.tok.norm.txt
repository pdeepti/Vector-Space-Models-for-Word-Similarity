but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .
i have seen that nurses become lawyers or social specialists , professions like that .

this country is getting old , really old .
demographs estimate that by the year 2050 more than half of the population will be over 50 years old .
and old people need a lot of health care .
so while many high school graduates know that their apprenticeship or studies can not guarantee them secure jobs , nursing holds the promise of life long employment . dominique hammermeister said she wants to go back to school after two or three years of working as a nurse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2004 miss manners for companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many executives still refuse to say how much money they take home two years ago , a so-called corporate governance code was established as a guideline for german companies .
executives have accepted the rules by and large , but many still refuse to reveal their salaries . the 15-page document was drawn up by a commission appointed by the government and led by gerhard cromme , the chairman of the board of trustees of steel giant thyssenkrupp . cromme is convinced that the code has been a success .
he recently said that it 's been widely accepted among german companies and helps them to improve management leadership .
by the end of 2004 , companies listed in the dax , germany 's stock index , will have implemented 96 percent of all recommendations in the codex , he said . who earns what ? one hotly contested area remains the publication of salaries paid to top executives , however .
only 11 out of the 30 dax companies agreed to reveal these numbers in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- is unhappy with that and said she will introduce legislation forcing companies to reveal salaries . that 's a step cromme rejects : he 's called on his colleagues to be more transparent when it comes to salaries .
an appropriate remuneration for top executives should not have to be hidden , he said . a need for change other questions still remain to be solved as well , however .

both teams could usher in a new golden age for their sport-crazy nations if they capture the prize on sunday night . portugal take to the field at the estadio da luz in lisbon on sunday night for a showdown not only with surprise opponents greece but with destiny .
in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "

portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.07.2004 german students turn to nursing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feeding patients is part of the job while many countries are struggling to find trainees for their hospitals , german high school graduates are flocking into nursing schools , ready to help people who are suffering .
but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .
i have seen that nurses become lawyers or social specialists , professions like that .
so you have a lot more opportunity , which in germany we don ’ t yet have . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's seniors will outnumber children 11:1 by 2050 it better not take too long before german nursing changes its face .
germany can not afford scaring too many young enthusiasts out of the job .
this country is getting old , really old .
demographs estimate that by the year 2050 more than half of the population will be over 50 years old .
and old people need a lot of health care .
so while many high school graduates know that their apprenticeship or studies can not guarantee them secure jobs , nursing holds the promise of life long employment . dominique hammermeister said she wants to go back to school after two or three years of working as a nurse .
once she is finished with her studies in nursing management , she says , she might want to have children herself .
it 's a great advantage this job holds for many women : its compatibility with family commitments .
and it is one of the reasons why they are willing to put up with meagre wages . dorothy sillem -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors across borders eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .

in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .

it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .

the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .

both teams could usher in a new golden age for their sport-crazy nations if they capture the prize on sunday night . portugal take to the field at the estadio da luz in lisbon on sunday night for a showdown not only with surprise opponents greece but with destiny .
in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .
" i think it is a great loss , he is one of the most valuable players in the team .
he is gutted not to be there and i think he deserved to be able to play " " but he is very energetic and gets very excited sometimes .
he lost his temper and he knows the rules of the game . "
karagounis is expected to be replaced by vassilios tsiartas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .

but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .
i have seen that nurses become lawyers or social specialists , professions like that .
so you have a lot more opportunity , which in germany we don ’ t yet have . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's seniors will outnumber children 11:1 by 2050 it better not take too long before german nursing changes its face .

but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .
i have seen that nurses become lawyers or social specialists , professions like that .
so you have a lot more opportunity , which in germany we don ’ t yet have . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's seniors will outnumber children 11:1 by 2050 it better not take too long before german nursing changes its face .
germany can not afford scaring too many young enthusiasts out of the job .
this country is getting old , really old .
demographs estimate that by the year 2050 more than half of the population will be over 50 years old .
and old people need a lot of health care .
so while many high school graduates know that their apprenticeship or studies can not guarantee them secure jobs , nursing holds the promise of life long employment . dominique hammermeister said she wants to go back to school after two or three years of working as a nurse .
once she is finished with her studies in nursing management , she says , she might want to have children herself .
it 's a great advantage this job holds for many women : its compatibility with family commitments .
and it is one of the reasons why they are willing to put up with meagre wages . dorothy sillem -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors across borders eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .

" king otto " rehhagel , an old school disciplinarian german , has taken greek soccer to unprecedented heights . he has already been offered greek citizenship and the unconditional adoration of a nation of 10 million , and some say a statue in the center of athens ca n't be far behind . the international press has run out of superlatives to describe the improbable run of otto rehhagel , 65 , and his greeks to the final of the european soccer championships .
prior to this year , the greek team had never won a match at a major tournament , qualifying for only two tournaments in the past 25 years . under rehhagel , greece beat hosts portugal in the opening game of the tournament , defending champions france in the quarterfinals and favorites the czech republic in the semifinals to advance to the final against portugal on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traianos dellas of greece , 5 , celebrates after scoring the winning goal against the czech republic .

both teams could usher in a new golden age for their sport-crazy nations if they capture the prize on sunday night . portugal take to the field at the estadio da luz in lisbon on sunday night for a showdown not only with surprise opponents greece but with destiny .
in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .
" i think it is a great loss , he is one of the most valuable players in the team .
he is gutted not to be there and i think he deserved to be able to play " " but he is very energetic and gets very excited sometimes .
he lost his temper and he knows the rules of the game . "

executives have accepted the rules by and large , but many still refuse to reveal their salaries . the 15-page document was drawn up by a commission appointed by the government and led by gerhard cromme , the chairman of the board of trustees of steel giant thyssenkrupp . cromme is convinced that the code has been a success .
he recently said that it 's been widely accepted among german companies and helps them to improve management leadership .
by the end of 2004 , companies listed in the dax , germany 's stock index , will have implemented 96 percent of all recommendations in the codex , he said . who earns what ? one hotly contested area remains the publication of salaries paid to top executives , however .

for example , chief executive officers should not head their company 's board of trustees immediately after retirement . companies ' annual shareholder meetings should be streamlined as well to do away with 12-hour marathon sessions that are currently the norm in germany . all of this requires companies to rethink their culture and that 's something that takes time , cromme said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.07.2004 german students turn to nursing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feeding patients is part of the job while many countries are struggling to find trainees for their hospitals , german high school graduates are flocking into nursing schools , ready to help people who are suffering .
but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .

but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .

both teams could usher in a new golden age for their sport-crazy nations if they capture the prize on sunday night . portugal take to the field at the estadio da luz in lisbon on sunday night for a showdown not only with surprise opponents greece but with destiny .
in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .
" i think it is a great loss , he is one of the most valuable players in the team .

scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .
" i think it is a great loss , he is one of the most valuable players in the team .
he is gutted not to be there and i think he deserved to be able to play " " but he is very energetic and gets very excited sometimes .
he lost his temper and he knows the rules of the game . "
karagounis is expected to be replaced by vassilios tsiartas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 04.07.2004 victory offers new dawn for both finalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach scolari 's tactics could send the " golden generation " off in style portugal and greece face each other once more in the final of euro 2004 .
both teams could usher in a new golden age for their sport-crazy nations if they capture the prize on sunday night . portugal take to the field at the estadio da luz in lisbon on sunday night for a showdown not only with surprise opponents greece but with destiny .
in the final of euro 2004 on home soil , the core of a team which promised the world finally gets the chance to deliver - with the help of a new " golden generation . "
with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "
greece surprised portugal by beating the hosts in their opening game , and scolari is expecting another closely fought contest at the luz stadium .
" greece will be strong rivals for us and i think the game could be decided in one small moment , like at a dead ball situation .
if we win , i 'll have a smile all the way across my face .
it will be the realization of all i imagined and dreamed . "
" whatever happens in the final greece will be the big winners at euro 2004 .
portuguese respect first game victors in an attempt to make sure that greece are not the actual winners at euro 2004 , star midfielder maniche has warned his teammates to remain patient against otto rehhagel 's greeks .
" we know we 'll need to be on form and mentally strong to win .
it will take patience .
we 've all seen that greece are a very compact side , who defend with discipline , but if we stay calm i 'm convinced we can win . "
" we are absolutely not the favorites , " said the porto player who scored perhaps the goal of the tournament so far with a 30 meter curling shots against holland in the semi-final .
" we have home advantage but england had more fans than us in our match and we still beat them . "
to win their first major tournament , the portuguese need to beat the team that gave them such a traumatic start to the tournament .
" portugal is a friendly country and we would n't think about getting revenge , " maniche said .
" we respect greece . "
fatigue hindering greek effort greece may need every piece of respect and will hope that respect will lead to early trepidation in the hosts as the glorious greeks fight a different battle - that of tiredness .
greek defender michail kapsis believes that the extra day portugal had to recover from their semi-final could play an important part in the final .
the greeks were pushed to the first half of extra-time by the czech republic and have had 24 hours less to rest .
" this is a real disadvantage for us .
we played against the czechs for 105 minutes and have another hard game three days later , " kapsis told reporters .
" everybody in greece expects us to win , but portugal have played well since we beat them in the opening game . "
supporters may hold the key to superiority the defender , who is struggling to make the final after picking up a knee injury in a training session on saturday , feels that the crowd will play an integral role in driving the greeks to unprecedented heights .
" they will have a lot of support but we know the crazy fans of greece will help make it good for us .
we are very thankful for our nation and want to applaud our fans . "
" most serious for us is that during the european championship we have been able to prove that greece is a good , organized footballing country .
i want to tell truth , before the matches started none of us expected to be at the final .
we believed in our team and ourselves but we did not think we would get this far . "
greece to feel karagounis loss greece will be without georgios karagounis , who picked up a second yellow card against the czechs , and the loss of the influential midfielder could hinder the greeks ' chances , according to veteran defender nikos dabizas .
" i think it is a great loss , he is one of the most valuable players in the team .

with luis figo , fernando couto and rui costa expected to call it a day on the international scene after sunday 's showdown with greece , the continuing hopes for portuguese soccer will be passed to the likes of christiano ronaldo , helder postiga and deco .
if those hopes can be passed to the new stars along with the title european champions , then coach luiz felipe scolari will have laid the foundations for a possible portuguese legacy .
scolari sticks with pauleta the portugal coach has had his fair share of detractors , both outside and within the team , but if portugal wakes up on monday sporting a nationwide hangover and the henri delauney trophy on its way to the a lisbon engravers , then his decisions will be vindicated .
questionable tactics such as beginning the tournament with ronaldo and deco on the bench and substituting figo in the quarter-final against england when losing will be forgotten if the ribbons on the cup are green and red come the day after .
scolari plans to test the faith of the faithful even further ahead of the final with his decision to stick with striker pauleta against greece despite his lack of goals .
" pauleta may not be scoring but he helps the team in other ways .
i have every confidence in him , " the brazilian coach told the pre-final press conference .
" his participation is always important for his determination , commitment and involvement in the group .
in theory , we should n't have to make changes .
we 're playing well but we 're going to have to play better . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.07.2004 german students turn to nursing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feeding patients is part of the job while many countries are struggling to find trainees for their hospitals , german high school graduates are flocking into nursing schools , ready to help people who are suffering .
but many quit the training early . in “ er " and other hospital soap operas , the job of a nurse is to look good , flirt with doctors and to say sentences laden with drama . but reality looks different . at the gynaecological ward of hamburg ’ s university hospital , nursing student dominique hammermeister recently attended to a patient who underwent an emergency operation the night before .
as she poked the syringe in the woman ’ s arm , dominique softly talked to her - to calm her down .
the woman who recently underwent an operation was worried about having lost too much blood . later dominique will hand out meal trays and collect them , she will change bandages , make beds , attend to new admissions , wash patients , pass out pills and attach drips , she will listen to all kinds of worries , and finally scribble down the documentation about each patient . dominique started at 6 o 'clock in the morning , at 3 p.m. her shift will be finished .
she is well into her third year at nursing school and earns little over € 600 -lrb- $ 739 -rrb- per month .
as a full nurse she might earn twice that – but still : the wages are peanuts in relation to the work load she copes with .
yet , like most other young people studying nursing , she does so out of real enthusiasm . „ i simply enjoy that you can help others and you do see the results , " she said .
" if you see people who have terminal cancer and only three weeks left to live , you really start appreciating your own life . ” what really gets at her , though , is that with all the commitment she shows in her job , she is banned from doing certain jobs , such as drawing blood .
nursing is a job full of limitations and it doesn ’ t really offer great perspectives . a lack of perspectives today , german nurses stay on the job for an average of only five years .
a comparative european study called next showed that germany produces the highest number of quitters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making patients ' beds “ it is not the exhaustion that is the main motivation for quitting in other countries , " said stephanie jöres , a spokeswoman for the association of protestant hospitals , adding that one in five students thinks about quitting the job .
" it is the lack of perspectives , the lack of possibilities to be creative and independent on this job . ” part of the problem is the old-fashioned education system in german nursing , said edith kellnhauser who used to work as a nurse all over the world : in egypt , in great britain , in germany and the united states .
germany has been very slow to invite progress into the profession , she said . “ one barrier i would think was the language , " kellnhauser said .
" many advanced books and articles in nursing come from english speaking countries and it was very difficult for german nursing students to read these publications in the original language .
the second barrier was that many of our nursing organizations in germany for many years were of the opinion that nursing is a profession that you do with your hands : ' you don ’ t need theories , you don ’ t need to be educated . '
well , that has changed dramatically . " a profession in need of change in 1992 kellnhauser acted as founding dean of the department of nursing science at the university for applied sciences in mainz – one of the first schools to offer classes in nursing management and nursing pedagogy .
this country still has a long way to go , she said .
american nursing students , in comparison , have it a lot easier . “ when you have a basic university education , okay , you can do nursing for two , three years , " she said .
" and then you say : ' well , i didn ’ t think this would turn out like this , ' so you can go and study a few more years and go into another profession .
i have seen that nurses become lawyers or social specialists , professions like that .
so you have a lot more opportunity , which in germany we don ’ t yet have . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's seniors will outnumber children 11:1 by 2050 it better not take too long before german nursing changes its face .
germany can not afford scaring too many young enthusiasts out of the job .
this country is getting old , really old .
demographs estimate that by the year 2050 more than half of the population will be over 50 years old .
and old people need a lot of health care .
so while many high school graduates know that their apprenticeship or studies can not guarantee them secure jobs , nursing holds the promise of life long employment . dominique hammermeister said she wants to go back to school after two or three years of working as a nurse .
once she is finished with her studies in nursing management , she says , she might want to have children herself .
it 's a great advantage this job holds for many women : its compatibility with family commitments .
and it is one of the reasons why they are willing to put up with meagre wages . dorothy sillem -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors across borders eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .

executives have accepted the rules by and large , but many still refuse to reveal their salaries . the 15-page document was drawn up by a commission appointed by the government and led by gerhard cromme , the chairman of the board of trustees of steel giant thyssenkrupp . cromme is convinced that the code has been a success .
he recently said that it 's been widely accepted among german companies and helps them to improve management leadership .
by the end of 2004 , companies listed in the dax , germany 's stock index , will have implemented 96 percent of all recommendations in the codex , he said . who earns what ? one hotly contested area remains the publication of salaries paid to top executives , however .
only 11 out of the 30 dax companies agreed to reveal these numbers in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- is unhappy with that and said she will introduce legislation forcing companies to reveal salaries . that 's a step cromme rejects : he 's called on his colleagues to be more transparent when it comes to salaries .
an appropriate remuneration for top executives should not have to be hidden , he said . a need for change other questions still remain to be solved as well , however .
for example , chief executive officers should not head their company 's board of trustees immediately after retirement . companies ' annual shareholder meetings should be streamlined as well to do away with 12-hour marathon sessions that are currently the norm in germany . all of this requires companies to rethink their culture and that 's something that takes time , cromme said .
but he added that the first signs of moving in that direction can already be felt . " my personal impression from the annual meetings is that the speeches from top executives have gotten shorter , " he said .
" that way there 's more time for a reasonable discussion between executives and shareholders . " german companies now hope that they will be able to prevent legislation by implementing changes in the near future .
but as zypries has pointed out , the federal government , which itself is currently planning to expand access to government documents in a bill similar to the united states freedom of information act , will not wait forever . klaus krepela -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors demand jail time for mannesmann execs mannesmann ag 's two top executives should be jailed and deutsche bank ag chief executive josef ackermann given a suspended sentence for wasting shareholders ' money .

the deal was signed in png capital port moresby by the two countries ' foreign ministers , after a six-month dispute over legal immunity for the personnel .
it is part of australia 's new role as peacekeeper in the south pacific .
last year australia led a force of 2,000 regional troops to restore order in the solomon islands .
the bbc 's phil mercer in sydney says papua new guinea is expected to pose even greater challenges for the australian police and bureaucrats .
in a compromise , anyone from the deployment who breaks the law will be prosecuted in australia , after a committee of representatives from both countries has assessed the case , afp news agency reported .
' important ' thursday 's deal will mean that up to 230 australian police will arrive in papua new guinea to fight crime , and to help ensure that the country does not become a base for terrorism .
" it is one of the most important single developments in australian foreign policy in recent years , " australia 's foreign minister , alexander downer , said during the signing ceremony .
" this takes the relationship forward in a dramatic way , " he added .
under the deal , costing a reported a $ 800m -lrb- $ 560m -rrb- , around 70 australian officials will take up positions in papua new guinea 's public sector .
at least four australian judges will sit on the papua new guinea bench and an australian will become the country 's top lawyer , the solicitor-general , to try to improve the justice system .
australian civil servants will also take on senior roles in economic management , immigration and prisons .
turning point our correspondent says the agreement is widely seen as a turning point in the relationship between the pacific neighbours .

bamse the norwegian sea dog is buried next to the town 's glaxosmithkline factory and was honoured in a service on sunday afternoon .
he came to the town in 1942 with royal norwegian navy captain erling hafto and became a symbol of freedom .
on his death 60 years ago he was given a hero 's funeral for his bravery .
bravery medal his reputation grew from his habits in battle whilst out at sea on his master 's ship , the minesweeper thorodd , based in montrose during world war ii .
he would stand firm at the foremost gun tower of the boat until hostilities ended and eventually received the pdsa award for bravery for his actions .
during his two years in the town , bamse , who used to wear a norwegian sailor 's cap , he became something of a local institution .
he was issued with his own bus permit , which hung around his neck , and would gather up any errant crew members from the local pubs .
he even featured on christmas and easter cards at the time and became a symbol of freedom to the allied forces .
war hero montrose port authority board member henny king , who helped organise the ceremony , said : " we thought we must do something to celebrate his life because he was such a wonderful story and we thought it only right that we celebrate such a brave war hero .
" he was known by everyone at the time and some of the town 's older generation can still remember him .
" after the summer we hope to start a fundraising campaign and raise enough money to build a life-size statue of him in a prominent position near the water .
" edinburgh has it 's own tribute to greyfriar 's bobby and there 's no reason why bamse ca n't become an equally prominent symbol for montrose .
" i would also like to write a book for children about bamse 's life and i would love to get local schools involved in the project . "
naval tribute when bamse died in july 1944 local schools closed and several hundred children attended his funeral .
he was buried with his head facing his homeland of norway .
in 1984 and 1994 , for his 40th and 50th anniversaries , a norwegian naval crew arrived in montrose to pay their respects at his graveside .
on sunday , lieutenant commander oistein jensen and 10 of his crew members from the norwegian submarine utvaer represented the force .
they were joined by about 100 invited guests , including the daughter of captain hafto , vigdis hafto , who went with her family to pay their own respects .

chancellor gordon brown is tony blair 's " natural successor " , former cabinet colleague peter mandelson says .
in an interview with ex-downing street communications chief alistair campbell , mr mandelson says he " respects " mr brown 's achievements .
the interview , an apparent bid to end years of suspicion between the men , will be shown on five on wednesday .
the tension is thought to date from mr mandelson 's decision to back mr blair over mr brown as labour leader in 1994 .
gordon ... is a big politician with very big ideas peter mandelson in the interview , former northern ireland secretary mr mandelson says : " i think that when tony blair chooses to stand down as prime minister , or is not elected by the public , i think that gordon brown will be his new labour successor .

tony is the dominant figure in the government and gordon is right behind him peter hain speculation about the leadership was " just nonsense " and the relationship between the prime minister and mr brown was unchanged , he told gmtv 's sunday programme .
he said : " gordon brown is a towering figure in the government and has been a hugely impressive chancellor .
obviously tony is the dominant figure in the government and gordon is right behind him .
" we have one of the most successful prime ministers that the labour government has ever had .
" i see , in tony blair , somebody who is absolutely determined ... who has really got his eye on the ball of winning the next election and driving this government forward . "
meanwhile , mr brown 's confidante ed balls , who has quit his treasury post to stand for election as an mp , has disclosed how close mr brown came to quitting at the end of 1999 .
he told the sunday telegraph mr brown had been tempted to take a job running the international monetary fund .
mr balls said : " a number of finance ministers contacted him to say that they really wanted him to take seriously the idea of moving over . "
but mr brown decided to stay in his post because he felt his work at the treasury was not complete , mr balls said .

gordon ... is a big politician with very big ideas peter mandelson in the interview , former northern ireland secretary mr mandelson says : " i think that when tony blair chooses to stand down as prime minister , or is not elected by the public , i think that gordon brown will be his new labour successor .

but mr brown decided to stay in his post because he felt his work at the treasury was not complete , mr balls said .

large motivational signs urge staff to build the nation .
banners on the wall read " made in uganda , sold in usa " .
tri-star supplies clothes to a range of us companies .
there are more than 2,000 workers at the site , stitching clothes to sell to american companies such as wal-mart , jc penney and target .
uganda 's government often hails tri-star as a successful beneficiary of the african growth and opportunity act -lrb- agoa -rrb- , which allows african companies to export textiles to the us duty free .
american lawmakers have just renewed the agoa legislation until 2015 .
companies that import fabric from outside of africa can continue to export duty free until 2008 .
but critics say the only reason why tri-star appears to be successful is because it is receiving plenty of support from the government .
profit from agoa ?
some of the world 's fastest developing countries have built their growth on the textile sector , where rising sales can boost both the small cotton farmer as well as big business .
if africa can benefit from preferential trade access under agoa , some of the inequity created by cotton subsidies in other parts of the world could also be eliminated .
asian cloth is made into clothing .
but some of uganda 's textile makers question their own ability to profit from the legislation .
the country 's flagship agoa exporter tri-star has benefited greatly from government subsidies and presidential enthusiasm , souring talk of trade with allegations of political favouritism .
the company sacked one quarter of its then 1,000 strong workforce earlier this year , citing indiscipline .
the action cast further shadows on its public image .
it prompted calls for the government to take an equity stake in the heavily-indebted company .
the company 's managing director vellipillai kananathan dismisses criticism of the company as unpatriotic and is optimistic it will make a profit this year .
already , he forecasts sales of $ 10m -lrb- £ 5.5m -rrb- for 2004 .
buying from china to sell in us but until the local textile industry can produce the right quality fabric , tri-star will have to import its basic raw material from the far east .
there is no profit to be made from doing this , textile maker southern range nyanza 's legal officer richard mubiru argues .
unless , that is , you have benefited from the kind of government help that tri-star has .
the government hails tri-star as a success story .
uganda 's textile industry is full of sharp businessmen , he laughs , and if there was money to be made in importing fabric from the far east to landlocked uganda , stitching it into garments and exporting it to america , they would be doing it .
the local textile sector needs to be revamped to enable it to benefit from agoa , mr mubiru says .
tri-star 's mr kananathan has said the company wants to use local fabric and may even set up its own textile mill .
upgrading textile mills to produce western standard fabric is not cheap .
southern range nyanza operates a textile mill in jinja , eastern uganda .
by the end of this year , the company will have spent a total of $ 10.5m on upgrading the plant .
go organic yuichi kashiwada of textile maker phenix logistics is similarly sceptical .
the local textile sector needs fresh investment .
the concessions offered under agoa are substantial , but american buyers want to buy cheap and in bulk from flexible suppliers says mr kashiwada , who is also the chairman of the uganda textile and manufacturers ' association .
ugandan sellers can not be flexible when it takes them two months to import their raw materials from china , he says .
ultimately , mr kashiwada believes that once his staff and factory are fully equipped to produce the right quality fabric , he will make more money selling to europe and japan under their preferential trade agreements .
european and japanese buyers favour smaller quantities and will pay a premium for organic cotton , a premium which will justify the expense of shipping product from central africa .
it should also result in a higher price for the farmer .
last year a cotton farmer got 350 ugandan shillings -lrb- £ 0.09 ; $ 0.17 -rrb- for a kilo of cotton lint .
if that cotton lint had been organic , the farmer could have got 20 % more .
expensive cash even the most vocal advocates of agoa say that progress has been slow .
high interest rates and immature financial markets have held business back , geoffrey onegi obel , the presidential adviser on agoa says .
south africa , swaziland and botswana have all benefited from fiscal incentives as well as competitive and varied financing .
in turn , they have seen their agoa exports rise , mr obel says .
tri-star has high hopes of making profits this year .
part of the problem , says hillary obonyo , chairman of the uganda manufacturers ' association , is that the publicity surrounding agoa " created an unjustifiable expectation , given that we did not have the capacity to benefit from it " .
expectations remain high and the hope remains that when ugandan textile mills start to produce fabric of a high enough quality , then the agoa dollars will be real .

the revelation that marks and spencer is investigating an apparent attempt to spy on the mobile phone records of its boss stuart rose has brought industrial espionage into sharp and somewhat worrying focus .
by the very nature of the activity it is impossible to quantify , but experts are in agreement that the issue is real and growing .
and the galloping pace of technology is making espionage , such as eavesdropping or theft , ever more of a potential problem for companies today .
mobile phones and the internet simply provide the bad guys with a number of additional ways to get at a company 's information , helped on by an ever more sophisticated and easily obtainable array of gadgets and tools with which to do their dirty work .
for example , an electronic bug can be enclosed in an apparently normal mobile phone battery , creating a listening device that is forever powered by the said power source and able to transmit the user 's two-way conversation .
listening in picture the scene : the company director hangs his coat up in the changing room before going off to begin his round of golf .
the attacker then simply opens up the executive 's mobile phone and switches the batteries .
industrial espionage is n't just in films or tv shows , it is real and out there security boss justin king the director may never find out he was being bugged .
after all , how many people know the file number on their mobile phone battery ?
yet an unscrupulous rival can now listen to some of his most intimate business conversations .
the institute of directors -lrb- iod -rrb- confirms that , from talking to its members , the potential of becoming a victim of industrial espionage now seems to be bigger than ever .
some 60 % of members have suffered from theft - be it electronic or of the more traditional form - while 14 % have reported internet crime in one form or another , explains iod head of business policy richard wilson .
concealed device " it is certain that the increased use of mobile phones and the internet means the potential to suffer from industrial espionage is bigger than ever .
was stuart rose the victim of industrial espionage ?
" every cloud has a silver lining though , so to speak , and it does provide a lot of opportunities for security companies to offer protection , " mr wilson told bbc news online .
bugging devices are found at 4-5 % of uk companies that ask for checks , according to justin king , managing director of c2i international , one firm which helps businesses prevent and counter industrial espionage .
" in some cases the bugs could have been in place for months or years .
people are just utterly horrified when they find out , just devastated , " mr king said .
commercial advantage mr king says the extent of the problem is evident when you realise that , according to industry estimates , more than £ 10m of bugging devices have now been sold in the uk .
considering some bugs cost as little as £ 40 each , that could be an awful lot of bugs .
real life espionage in 2001 procter and gamble admitted spying on rival unilever for information on its shampoos boeing was punished by the us air force in 2003 for resorting to espionage in order to better its defence rival lockheed martin " they are out there and companies can not afford to ignore the problem , " he said .
and mr king is in no doubt about the motivating factor behind the bugging trend : money .
" information is vital when the markets are tight and people want to get an advantage .
this is especially vital when in cases of mergers or hostile takeovers .
" that one fact or figure could make all the difference . "
cleaning up there are also a number of semi-legal firms providing spying services , mr king added .
check under the lamp shade " these people are very easy to find , sadly it is n't hard , " he said .
and in addition from simply protecting internet and phone systems , companies also need to keep an eye on their staff , be it full time workers or contract cleaners .
" i 'm told the going rate to get a cleaner to steal something for you in london is £ 20 , " said mr king .
" we have had clients who have had a cleaner steal a vital document , or photograph it with a mobile phone , or even in one instance , simply copy it on one of the firm 's photocopiers .
you do not want to leave sensitive documents lying around .
" industrial espionage is n't just in films or tv shows , it is real and out there . " said mr king .

it is the first time the 27 books have been translated directly from the original greek .
cornish speakers from gloucestershire , london , birmingham and cornwall were involved in the 444-page project .
the team is now working on a similar project in an attempt to produce a version in cornish of the old testament .
biblical cornish oberow an abesteli : acts of the apostles dhe dus korinth i : 1 corinthians ebrowyon : hebrews yowann : john keith syed has been leading the translation .
he said it has been a " labour of love " as there is a lack of vocabulary in cornish .
but a lecturer in cornish studies , dr bernard deacon , believes there are more relevant ways to attract new cornish speakers .
he said : " there could be an argument that the time might have been better spent translating harry potter perhaps .
" having a bible in cornish is an interesting feat but whether it will do much for spoken cornish , one is left in doubt . "
