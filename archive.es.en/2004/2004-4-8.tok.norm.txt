from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .
but the research might also explain why some " concept shops " and luxury goods boutiques in german big cities are flourishing despite low consumer spending . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hugo shows china who 's boss in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .
motassadeq 's new trial is likely begin on june 16 , but with a different panel of judges than that which convicted him last year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moroccan convicted for aiding sept .

he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2004 opinion : blockading terror trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only person convicted of involvement in the sept .
11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler .

the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .

according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler .

that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .
but the research might also explain why some " concept shops " and luxury goods boutiques in german big cities are flourishing despite low consumer spending . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hugo shows china who 's boss in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .

the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .

blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .
but the research might also explain why some " concept shops " and luxury goods boutiques in german big cities are flourishing despite low consumer spending . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hugo shows china who 's boss in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .

in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

announcing the proposals , enlargement commissioner günter verheugen stressed the significance of the plan and saying if no agreement is reached " the opportunity will go for a very long time .
the question is not a choice between this plan and another , it is between this plan or no solution at all . "
the un plan is a result of frantic negotiations over recent weeks to try and re-unite the island which has been divided since 1974 .
both the united nations and brussels are stressing that this is last revised plan for a long time .
referring to conversations with un secretary general kofi annan , verheugen said : " for him this is definitely the final approach .
there will be no other . "

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .

sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .

spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .
" we do n't know how much longer our workers ' neutrality can effectively protect them in this situation , " said hartmut wilfert , a spokesman for adh . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms slow to enter iraq reconstructing iraq has opened up vast opportunity for international companies , but german businesses have been slow to claim their slice of the pie .

with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .

according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .
but the research might also explain why some " concept shops " and luxury goods boutiques in german big cities are flourishing despite low consumer spending . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hugo shows china who 's boss in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .

state prosecutor johannes puls told reporters outside the düsseldorf court building that deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , one of the six defendants , had deliberately broken the law governing listed german companies .
in a new charge introduced on thursday , reuters said the state prosecutors are abandoning their previous criminal charge of breach of trust to focus on the lesser charge that ackermann knew that at least one bonus payment , to mannesmann supervisory board member joachim funk , broke the law .
ackermann and other former mannesmann directors had faced the charge of wasting shareholder money in approving € 60 million -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- of payments to managers of the steel-to-telecoms conglomerate when it was bought by vodafone in 2000 .

state prosecutor johannes puls told reporters outside the düsseldorf court building that deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , one of the six defendants , had deliberately broken the law governing listed german companies .
in a new charge introduced on thursday , reuters said the state prosecutors are abandoning their previous criminal charge of breach of trust to focus on the lesser charge that ackermann knew that at least one bonus payment , to mannesmann supervisory board member joachim funk , broke the law .
ackermann and other former mannesmann directors had faced the charge of wasting shareholder money in approving € 60 million -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- of payments to managers of the steel-to-telecoms conglomerate when it was bought by vodafone in 2000 .
but last week , the judge in the trial virtually threw out the case when she told a packed courtroom that the prosecution had failed to convince her that ackermann and others had done anything criminally wrong . more briefs 08.04.2004 -pipe- lufthansa passenger traffic rises in first quarter 08.04.2004 -pipe- germany to sell stakes in frankfurt , cologne and munich airports 07.04.2004 -pipe- it outsourcing threatens german jobs 07.04.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler ceo confident of recovery 07.04.2004 -pipe- labor office head accused of illegal hires 06.04.2004 -pipe- berlin wertheim land reportedly to be sold 06.04.2004 -pipe- no spring reprieve for germany 's unemployed 06.04.2004 -pipe- eu , philip morris to settle smuggling controversy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bundesbank president ernst welteke was told to take a leave of absence by the central bank 's board late wednesday , ending days of speculation he would be forced to resign for accepting a free stay at a luxury hotel . the bundesbank 's executive board said in a written statement that welteke would follow its recommendation and suspend his duties effective immediately .
but the board said it did not find reason enough to demand his resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , has been heavily criticized for spending four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's notes and coins launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . bundesbank vice president jürgen stark will take over welteke 's job and will participate in deliberations on monetary policy for the euro zone at the ecb .
the decision to put welteke on leave comes amid a legal probe into the affair and increasing media hostility toward the once well-respected head of the german central bank . the hotel scandal first came to light when newsmagazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector .
for the stay in berlin , the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . many germans were incensed by the matter , since welteke earns € 350,000 a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he has paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank has covered the days welteke undertook work-related duties during the trip . government for resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have made little secret of the fact they think he should resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly said that resignation might be the right thing to do .

now that it looks like welteke 's days are numbered , speculation has increased about who berlin would pick to take the helm of the bundesbank .
although vice president stark is well regarded as a central banker , he has ties to the conservative opposition .
a more likely candidate is deputy finance minister caio koch-weser . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .

bundesbank president ernst welteke was told to take a leave of absence by the central bank 's board late wednesday , ending days of speculation he would be forced to resign for accepting a free stay at a luxury hotel . the bundesbank 's executive board said in a written statement that welteke would follow its recommendation and suspend his duties effective immediately .
but the board said it did not find reason enough to demand his resignation . welteke , germany 's highest-paid public official and the country 's representative at the european central bank , has been heavily criticized for spending four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's notes and coins launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . bundesbank vice president jürgen stark will take over welteke 's job and will participate in deliberations on monetary policy for the euro zone at the ecb .
the decision to put welteke on leave comes amid a legal probe into the affair and increasing media hostility toward the once well-respected head of the german central bank . the hotel scandal first came to light when newsmagazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had ignored potential conflicts of interest , given that the bundesbank is partly responsible for regulating the german banking sector .
for the stay in berlin , the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . many germans were incensed by the matter , since welteke earns € 350,000 a year .
mixing business with pleasure , the central banker confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed at the hotel .
in an attempt to make amends , he has paid for two nights of the stay himself , while the bundesbank has covered the days welteke undertook work-related duties during the trip . government for resignation members of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have made little secret of the fact they think he should resign over the affair .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank , which enjoys considerable independence under german law , to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly said that resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caio koch-weser : the next president of the bundesbank ?
now that it looks like welteke 's days are numbered , speculation has increased about who berlin would pick to take the helm of the bundesbank .
although vice president stark is well regarded as a central banker , he has ties to the conservative opposition .
a more likely candidate is deputy finance minister caio koch-weser . koch-weser has plenty of international financial experience from his years at the finance ministry and his time at the world bank in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2004 opinion : blockading terror trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only person convicted of involvement in the sept .
11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .

how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

announcing the proposals , enlargement commissioner günter verheugen stressed the significance of the plan and saying if no agreement is reached " the opportunity will go for a very long time .
the question is not a choice between this plan and another , it is between this plan or no solution at all . "
the un plan is a result of frantic negotiations over recent weeks to try and re-unite the island which has been divided since 1974 .
both the united nations and brussels are stressing that this is last revised plan for a long time .
referring to conversations with un secretary general kofi annan , verheugen said : " for him this is definitely the final approach .
there will be no other . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2004 opinion : blockading terror trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only person convicted of involvement in the sept .
11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .

was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .

11 terror attacks was released on wednesday ahead of a retrial .
the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

11 terror suspect released on bail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq , left , leaving prison on wednesday .
a hamburg court has released mounir el motassadeq , the only person to be convicted of involvement in the september 11 terror attacks , on bail ahead of a retrial . mounir el motassadeq , the only man worldwide convicted over the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , has been freed by a german court on wednesday pending a new trial ordered by a federal tribunal . he was ordered freed on condition that he stay in hamburg and not be issued a new passport , said sabine westphalen , spokesperson for the hamburg state court .
el motassadeq 's whereabouts were not immediately known . westphalen said that there was no longer " urgent suspicion " against him on the charge of accessory to murder , leading the judges to approve his release in a closed-doors hearing . she said , however , that the tribunal had found that there was still " urgent suspicion " of membership of a terrorist organization but that this was legally insufficient to keep him in custody .
" he will be released from investigative custody today but not without conditions , " westphalen said . motaasadeq was jailed as an accessory to more than 3,000 murders , and for being a member of the hamburg-based cell which supplied three of the suicide hijackers who carried out the sept .
11 attacks .
he was given a 15-year sentence for the crimes last year . however , germany 's federal criminal court threw out the verdict , ordering a retrial after the presiding judge at a hearing last month said the evidence against motassadeq had not been sufficient for a conviction . motassedeq 's lawyers believe that the sentence could be quashed entirely when the case goes to retrial , saying that there is a possibility that it could collapse on the same grounds as his original conviction due to key evidence being withheld by the united states .

the german judiciary showed it takes its cues from the rule of law , not from political pressure . it is indeed remarkable how within a year the tide turned in the first worldwide terror trial since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
what went wrong ?
how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .
and it had become a certainty , at the latest by the time germany 's federal criminal court in sharp words overturned the conviction in the motassadeq case last month . evidence was kept secret all too long .
or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?
confessions from other suspected top terrorists fill the file cabinets of intelligence agencies .
but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .
the federal prosecutors who are responsible for terrorism trials have rarely been thus unmasked .
the summarily constructed charges that left so many holes in the allegedly watertight chain of evidence have now collapsed like a house of cards . setback for u.s.- german relations and u.s.-german relations will experience a further setback .
for u.s. attorney general john ashcroft and his people will again have nothing better to do than charge the german judiciary of being " wimpy . "
on top of it all , during a time in which al qaeda practically declared war on spain and announced further terror attacks . but the snide remarks should bounce off the cool headed-types who have the courage to look closely - to deliberate precisely whether it 's in accordance with the rule of law to do the utmost to sentence these defendants - as has been the case - no matter what the cost . did the judges who sentenced motassadeq to 15 years in jail loose their nerve ?
was the political pressure so high that they could n't do otherwise ?
no , since firstly , at the time there was no exonerating testimony from ramzi binalshibh , considered a top terrorist in the al qaeda network and currently in u.s. custody . and secondly , the judges said that their sentence could be overturned if binalshibh one day exonerated the defendant , testimony that was at the time inaccessible due to a u.s. blockade .
but now it is available , and new incriminating evidence has not been unearthed so far . al qaeda 's terror attacks are inhuman , brutal crimes that must be atoned for .
those responsible for them must be called to account , but not anyone who the authorities get their hands on , at any price .
a well-functioning , vigilant judiciary merely proves that , at any rate , the german legal system works .
the united states should finally abandon its blockade policy for terror trials and make sure that everything , absolutely everything , that can contribute to clarification comes to light and to the german judiciary . claudia venohr , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

how can it be that one court imposes the highest penalty for accessory to murder in more than 3,000 counts , while another brings about moroccan mounir el motassadeq 's conditional release ? it was to be expected - ever since the second hamburg terror trial , against abdelghani mzoudi , ended with an acquittal .

or is it not more accurate to say suppressed ?

but for the judges - who after all decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent - they were inaccessible . now retaliation has come for this absolutely unacceptable manner of dealing with the judiciary .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times .

the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .

and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .

with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .

according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler .

" ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .

actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .

on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .

their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .

" " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .

the u.s. and its allies fought against both sunni and shi 'ite fighters in iraq on thursday .
following reports that foreign nationals were kidnapped by armed groups , german aid organizations are considering pulling out . coalition forces , including bulgarian and polish troops , were engaged in serious fighting with radical militias for the fourth day on thursday , as armed groups kidnapped a number of foreign civilians , according to media reports .
the heavy fighting that has erupted across iraq during the past week is the worst since the end of major combat operations in may 2003 .
spurred on by radical shi 'ite leader moqtada al-sadr , members of his militia took over the towns of najaf and kut , south of baghdad . in heavy fighting beginning wednesday , ukrainian soldiers abandoned their base in al kut , suffering a casualty in the fighting .
sunni radicals opened up another front of fighting against the americans north of baghdad in the cities of ramadi and falluja .
twelve marines died in ramadi after sunni fighters attacked a u.s. base .
since fighting began four days ago , 35 u.s. and allied soldiers have died and hundreds of iraqis killed .
foreign governments nervous the fighting has elicited strong statements of commitment from washington , but made the governments of allied troops in iraq nervous .
those concerns are likely to rise after reports that armed iraqi groups kidnapped several foreign nationals on thursday , warning they would kill them if their governments did n't pull out of iraq .
three japanese citizens , one woman and two men , a briton and eight koreans were said kidnapped .
one of the japanese hostages was a freelance journalist , the other two were human rights workers .
the koreans , who were working for a church group , were reportedly relased later in the day .
a government spokesperson in tokyo said he saw no reason to pull 550 japanese troops , in iraq on non-combat missions , out of the country .
neutrality no longer guaranteed german aid organizations said on thursday that they were considering pulling their people out of the country .
the group aktion deutschland hilft -lrb- adh -rrb- , which encompasses several non-profit organizations , said they had already significantly reduced their activities in iraq .

thursday marks the official start of celebrations of the 100th anniversary for the entente cordiale , the agreement signed by france and britain to end centuries of bloody rivalry . queen elizabeth ii walks towards a crowd of cheering parisians on a sunny but chilly french morning .
the british flag flutters in the breeze barely a kilometer away on the champs elysées .
the british prime minister tony blair checks his diary to confirm his visit to the french capital next month and while he 's at it , flips a couple of pages to see when president jacques chirac is due in london this autumn . is this a snippet from a tale of fiction or the fevered hallucinations of the lesser-spotted francophile ?
actually it is neither .
this is the reality of franco-british relations in 2004 … or , more to the point , one of the many realities of franco-british relations in 2004 . this year marks the 100 anniversary of the entente cordiale , a colonial-era deal between britain and france that ended centuries of military hostility .
it is a reason for celebration ; a reason for dignitaries from both sides of the channel to smile and embrace their neighbours , joyous in the fact that in the past century , the two bitter rivals have not gone to war with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees .
queen elizabeth has been enjoying french hospitality this week as the celebrations get under way officially on thursday .
her majesty visited toulouse on wednesday on the final day of her three day tour , visiting the site of the last battle to be fought by the two countries . smiles will be in evidence throughout the events that mark the hundred years since edward vii , the queen 's great-grandfather , and théophile delcassé , the french foreign minister of the time , resolved their two countries ' long-running territorial disputes in 1904 .
but given the notorious distrust and often forced cordiality between france and britain , these smiles may just be displays of gritted teeth . agreement born from concerns about germany hundreds of years of war and colonial competition could not possibly be wiped out from the psyche of two proud nations by a single act of rapprochement .
indeed , the entente cordiale , for all its genuine attempts at healing deeply historical wounds , was born not out of a common desire to love thy neighbour but from a fear of a powerful third party .
in fact , the reason that france and britain papered over centuries of rivalry and mutual suspicion was the rise of germany and the concern over its military and naval strength . since aligning themselves with each other out of necessity during the two world wars , britain and france have maintained solid diplomatic ties but have often found themselves at odds over policy within europe and have at times endured prolonged personal spats over topics such as trade .
as a result , there are still generations of british who do not buy french apples and many in france who will go nowhere near meat exported from across the channel . in more recent times , the entente cordiale has been put to even sterner tests .
after world war ii , when the power of germany had been crushed and the former enemy pacified , britain looked across the atlantic for the source of its post-war rehabilitation .
the countries of the mainland continent began work in rebuilding themselves from the smouldering ashes of europe while britain looked increasingly to the emerging dominance of the united states for support and guidance . anglo-american ties define current eu relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
the effects of over 50 years of this " special " transatlantic relationship between britain and the u.s. have become increasingly evident in the directions france and britain have taken in the european union and in the dispute over iraq . in european terms , britain has found itself replaced as france 's main partner by germany .
the two countries share an economic outlook and a vision for a two-speed europe where the eu powerhouses can forge policy at a faster rate than " lesser " members .
in contrast , britain finds itself cut adrift from the franco-german power axis within the eu due to its more atlanticist leanings and , as a result , finds itself more often than not in opposition . the odd couple the co-operation between germany and france are astounding , even by modern standards .
french and german politicians and officials enjoy regular contact across the rhine .
the adviser on germany for jean-pierre raffarin , french prime minister , is a german diplomat .
hundreds of germans have graduated from france 's ecole nationale d 'administration , its elite civil-service college .
this year , for the first time , three are joining the french civil service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
on a personal level , the differences between the leaders are also evidently split along the same lines .
even at their most friendly , tony blair and jacques chirac 's relationship pales into insignificance compared with that of the french president and german chancellor gerhard schröder . chirac was even asked by schröder to stand in for him at an eu summit when the chancellor had more pressing issues at home . the british prime minister and the french president rarely hit such cosy heights .
chirac famously called off an anglo-french summit in 2002 after accusing blair of speaking to him rudely while blair has been quoted as calling chirac a " demagogue . " iraq showed extent of division the real evidence of the divide came with the iraq war with britain siding with the united states and france joining with germany in the vociferous anti-war camp .
at the height of the dispute before combat operations began , the entente was far from cordiale . the sometimes rocky personal relationship between blair and chirac was tested once more during this time when the president asked the prime minister how he would be able to look his baby son leo in the eye in the years to come if he took britain into an illegal war .
blair was far from pleased . both countries accept they need each other when it comes to le crunch , the french know that , when forced to choose , britain believes that its interests are best served by aligning with america .
this is always going to make it an uncertain european partner .
but on the other hand , the exertion of french power in an expanded europe can not rely on the help of germany alone .
britain also knows that if it intends to continue its balancing act with the u.s. and europe , the powerful french will have to be onside from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and chirac so , in much the same circumstances that brought about the entente cordiale in 1904 , france and britain must continue to work together to get what they want - a small price to pay for the forced smiles and limp handshakes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting back to cordial : anglo-french summit in london british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .

in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month . despite the collapse of talks between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot sides over a u.n.-brokered plan to reunify the divided island of cyprus last week , experts are still holding out hope that the blueprint would be approved by citizens from both halves of the island in two separate referendums scheduled for april 24 . the vote will determine whether a united cyprus joins the european union on may 1 or whether its 30-year division will continue . papadopoulos dashes peace hopes but on wednesday greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos threw a damper on reunification hopes when he called on his citizens to " vote a strong no " during an impassioned televised speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary-general kofi annan papadopoulos , who has made no secret of his dislike for the plan ever since u.n. secretary-general kofi anan -lrb- photo -rrb- ordered it to be put up for a vote , said during a 50-minute speech broadcast live on cyprus tv that the plan reinforced the current partition of the island rather than leading to reunification . " our country is living through the most dramatic moments of its history that will determine our present and that of our future generations , " he said .
" after judging all the facts … i am sincerely sorry that i can not sign acceptance of the annan plan . " turkish cypriot slant though papadopoulos 's call to reject the plan amounts to a setback to the peace process , the greek cypriot stance has not prompted much surprise .
the latest version of the u.n. blueprint was widely perceived as favoring the turkish cypriot side . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece . a breakaway turkish cypriot state in the north is only recognized by turkey , which maintains 40,000 troops there . under annan 's plan , separate greek and turkish cypriot states would be created that would be linked by a weak federal government .
it would also restrict movement and property rights , allowing no more than 18 percent of greek cypriots to move into the turkish-controlled northern half for the first 18 years after reunification .
an estimated 180,000 greeks are seeking to return to their homes in the north . papadopoulos said on wednesday that the plan was too biased .
" the turkish side gets all its demands from the first day of the imposition of a settlement … the plan writes off the turkish invasion and the consequences of the occupation and legitimizes the illegal presence of the tens of thousands of turkish mainland settlers , " he said . the greek cypriot leader added that the plan violated basic human rights and principles of the european union ensuring the right of refugees to return and to repossess their properties . polls have shown a majority of greek cypriots are against the plan .
their main objection is that it limits the right of all greek cypriot refugees - numbering about 200,000 - to return to the north and reclaim their properties in accordance with security council resolutions , while allowing more than 60,000 turkish mainland settlers in the north to remain . turkish cypriots wavering too turkey in principle has accepted the u.n. peace plan and stands much to gain through reunification .
overnight , northern cyprus , an internationally isolated and unrecognized state could become a member of the eu . though turkey would be giving up some land , it would also gain political power in a united cyprus , and the embargo against turkish cyprus would be suspended , bringing economic growth .
a reunified cyprus would also boost turkey 's own chances of joining the eu some day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash despite those obvious advantages , turkish cypriot opinion is also split on acceptance .
polls indicate approval by a margin of only a couple of percentage points .
veteran turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- has shot down the plan and said on wednesday that he would campaign hard for its rejection in the referendum . hope , though dim , still flickers but all may not be lost yet .
turkish cypriot prime minister mehmet ali talat and greek opposition leader george papandreou have both appealed to people in both halves of the divided island to approve the u.n. plan so that cyprus can enter the eu unified on may 1 . even the eu 's expansion commissioner günter verheugen , speaking in brussels earlier , said the opportunity for reunification of the island " should not be missed . "
verheugen added : " i can only express the hope that the two communities in cyprus will seize this opportunity to reconcile their differences . " if that does n't happen however , the outcome looks bleak . only the greek half of cyprus will enter the union and eu laws and benefits will only apply to the internationally recognized greek cypriot southern part of the island . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds out hope for cyprus reunification deal after the collapse of talks in switzerland , greek cypriots seem poised to oppose a plan to reunite the island in an upcoming referendum .

from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry . the german retail industry is facing hard times .
with consumers holding tightly onto their purse strings , sales have taken a nosedive .
shops in several german cities increasingly wear a deserted look , others are struggling to stay afloat with desperate price reductions . a slew of studies conducted on the tight-fisted behavior of german consumers , have all more or less come to the same conclusion - the dour economic reality is to blame .
while shopkeepers figure out how to get at germans who do n't spend money , researchers across germany has been focusing on those that do . in projects at government-financed universities , so-called consumer sociologists are involved in finding out more about the different types of consumers and what influences their shopping patterns . the trend shopper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopper in a boutique for instance , two researchers at the university of dortmund recently discovered a new species of the modern consumer - the trend shopper .
one of the researchers , ronald hitzler explained that the trend shopper detests off the hook clothing - whether it 's cheap garb or famous luxury labels - and hunts for what corresponds to his version of " trend . " " the trend shopper needs to know with what he can find acceptance tomorrow from the right kind of people .
that means that he must know above all where and how he can get everything today , that would fit tomorrow with the right kind of people , what we call a ' must , " ' hitzler said . the styler : extravagant and choosy hitzler 's fellow researcher michaela pfadenhauer said her ethnological investigations in munich 's hi-fashion scene had also yielded a further rare and particularly extravagant type of trend hopper , known in research parlance as the " styler . "
the styler , pfadenhauer , elaborated , is below 40 , could be a male or a female and is usually single . " ' the styler has a so-called interesting profession , preferably in fashion or media or in the advertising industry , public relations , in gastronomy or in the so-called art and culture business , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the styler usually has a high income and he can work flexibly , which means that he can has time and money for a particular lifestyle even during tough economic times . " the styler rarely has kids , but almost always rich parents , who can , when needed , help him keep up his lifestyle .
the styler has an urban lifestyle and lives and close to the ' scene , " ' she said .
" that means his fashionable old-style apartment is in the same neighborhood as all the hip clubs , bars and cafes that he frequents .
and his apartment usually looks like them - lots of room , minimal but expensive furniture , lots of improvisation . " 100 euro for a t-shirt ? the consumer sociologists have concluded that the styler appears to define himself through his consumption .
according to them , he seeks the attention of a small scene , which comprises hardly more than a thousand people in a metropolis , and thus attempts to stand apart from the crowd . more importantly , the styler 's biggest passion is exclusive shopping in the few " concept shops " , where largely unknown designers offer their creations . pfadenhauer conceded these could appear downright strange and even outlandish to the " normal consumer " with its horrifically astronomical pricing for seeming self-stitched apparel , but pointed out that it contained certain irresistible features for the styler . " for instance , this t-shirt was bought for five euros by the designer in a large department store , " pfadenhauer said , showing off a € 100 shirt she bought in one of the concept stores .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trendy shop " but i bet that the print was already on the t-shirt .
it was then worked on , upgraded with these sequins that are terribly ' in ' at the moment and this pink toile bow and was embroidered with these stars at the back .
and the most important thing is this small label with the name of the designer .
there are even some which say , ' this individual piece was made with love for you ' , " she said . such findings might appear frivolous to most at a time when germany is facing a major economic downturn .
but the research might also explain why some " concept shops " and luxury goods boutiques in german big cities are flourishing despite low consumer spending . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : hugo shows china who 's boss in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .

a soldier nursing a survivor , said to be the child of vincent otti i was in the northern town of gulu , filming for the forthcoming bbc2 special , a day of war , when lt col charles otema , the incongruously genial head of military intelligence for the area , contacted me .
he said government troops from the uganda people 's defence force -lrb- updf -rrb- had scored a " significant blow " against the rebels .
he told me the lra 's second-in-command , vincent otti , had been injured in the battle , 55 rebels had been killed - and that , as we spoke , government forces were pursuing the rest through the bush .
he invited me to come and see the evidence for myself .
massacre in a tiny military helicopter , we flew 85 kilometres north-west , towards the sudanese border .
northern uganda is one of the most fertile places in africa - it could feed the whole of uganda and more .
the updf has been fighting a long war against the rebels but as we buzzed through the heat we could see the land below , hatched with the marks of abandoned fields and villages .
this land has been terrorised by the lra .
one and a half million people have been displaced by the war and live today in cramped and isolated refugee camps , dependent on heavily-armed convoys from the world food programme .
even there they are not safe .
just two months ago , as many as 300 were killed when the lra raided just one such camp , barlonyo , near lira .
terrible initiation once the lra had a programme of sorts ­ a combination of christian fundamentalism and political opposition to the government of president yoweri museveni .
the barlonyo camp was destroyed in a rebel attack today it is as much a cult as an army , preying on the mainly acholi people of the north , the very people it claims to represent .
the lra survives by raiding villages and camps , stealing food and provisions , and abducting people ­ mainly women and children .
the older ones they will use as porters till they have no further use of them .
the younger ones ­ the 10 , 11 and 12-year-olds , they will keep .
not uncommonly they will steal perhaps three kids from the same family and then , in the bush , force the youngest two to kill the oldest one .
thus they are initiated into their new life as rebels .
bound to the cause by a terrible cocktail of guilt , fear and violence .
corpses in the undergrowth our helicopter touched down in a village which had been taken over as a forward base for the ugandan army .
the helicopter could get no nearer and we had to cover the remaining four kilometres on foot .
and then we arrived at the site of the battle .
it was a scene of terrible carnage .
dozens of bodies lay scattered around the undergrowth where they had fallen .
the first body i saw , the first of these 55 dead rebels , was about four-years-old .
almost certainly he had been born in captivity - probably , like so many others , the product of a forced marriage between an older rebel and a young abducted girl .
some 10 metres away , just such a girl lay , dead , stripped to the waist .
she may have been the child 's mother .
rag-tag force in the shade of a clump of trees was another group of corpses - a couple of kids , barely teenagers , an older man and a couple of women .
one of the women was huddled against a tree , clutching it as if for protection , her head bowed .
lt col otema questions children captured after the assault she looked as though she was still alive , until i walked round and from the other side i could see the top two-thirds of her head had gone , blown away by rockets from one of the ugandan army 's new helicopter gunships .
this , i was told , was the group which had been sitting with vincent otti , deputy commander of this brutal rag-tag army of stolen children .
according to survivors , he had been injured in the attack and carried away into the bush on a stretcher .
the other dead woman in this group was , i was told , one of vincent otti 's wives .
his three-year-old daughter had been found alive , wandering through the carnage .
' awful war ' we were moving quickly through the bodies - the area was not entirely safe - when i heard a soldier say : " this one 's alive ! "
he was a boy , of fighting age certainly ­ so perhaps 14 .
he was lying semi-conscious , his chest shuddering .
he had lain there , unattended , for nearly 24 hours .
" ca n't we get medical attention for him ? "
i asked .
" we will carry him back and treat him , " i was told .
but then five minutes later a soldier brought the news he was dead .
' it is ... difficult to defend the slaughter ... in the name of peace ' " too bad , " said lt col otema .
" but at least you know we wanted to rescue him . "
this is , truly , an awful war .
few would deny that military action is needed to contain the lra and protect local people - but in that bloody battlefield near sudan , it was equally clear to me that the price of a purely military solution is unacceptably high .
it is very difficult to defend the slaughter of four-year-olds in the cause of peace .
serious international pressure might force both sides into peace negotiations ­ but it has been slow in coming .
last year the lra abducted 9,000 young people .
it is tempting to think that if they had been stealing oil rather than children , the rest of the world would have paid more attention .

campaigners are angry a nuclear vessel may be berthed near the city but emergency planners have given a clear signal that nuclear submarines are to return to southampton , after preparing a similar radiation disaster action plan .
the emergency guidelines advise residents on what to do if a visiting submarine is involved in an accident , releasing radioactive material .
advice will be sent to residents within a 2km radius of southampton 's nuclear berth , prior to a visit .
campaigners are furious nuclear vessels could be berthed so near a major city .
tablets handed out the royal navy has used the so-called z-berth twice in the last six years , according to the city council , which has no say over whether nuclear-powered vessels visit southampton .
it is the last remaining z-berth based in a commercial uk port .
in the event of a nuclear accident , residents in the 2km zone will be issued with potassium iodate tablets -lrb- pits -rrb- , told not to collect their children from school , to stay inside and not use the telephone .
di mcdonald , of the southampton-based nuclear information service , says the plan , called sotonsafe , will fail in the event of a disaster .
people are told not to collect their children from school and that 's very alarming for parents di mcdonald she told bbc news online : " the council 's position is that they do not want nuclear submarines in the docks , but if they have no choice , they want to protect people .
" if you have a plume of radiation coming over a town then that 's very hard to do .
it really is n't doable for real , ordinary people .
it 's bound to fail .
" people are told not to collect their children from school and that 's very alarming for parents ; teachers might have to administer tablets to children , which they are not qualified to do .
" it 's irresponsible of the navy to insist on bringing a nuclear reactor into the middle of a major city . "
' visit possibly sometime next year ' she said campaigners are also angry the full plan - which took the city council two years to put together after safety responsibilities were passed to them from the navy - is only available at present in public libraries .
a navy spokesman told bbc news online : " there are no plans at the moment to bring a nuclear-powered vessel into southampton - and there wo n't be a visit until the council plan has been exercised and approved by the nuclear installations inspectorate .
" we have never had an accident involving the release of radioactive material into the environment in any of our nuclear subs during the 40 to 50 years we 've been operating them .
" in any event , we do n't discuss movements of subs much before about a week ahead .

campaigners are angry a nuclear vessel may be berthed near the city but emergency planners have given a clear signal that nuclear submarines are to return to southampton , after preparing a similar radiation disaster action plan .
the emergency guidelines advise residents on what to do if a visiting submarine is involved in an accident , releasing radioactive material .
advice will be sent to residents within a 2km radius of southampton 's nuclear berth , prior to a visit .
campaigners are furious nuclear vessels could be berthed so near a major city .
tablets handed out the royal navy has used the so-called z-berth twice in the last six years , according to the city council , which has no say over whether nuclear-powered vessels visit southampton .
it is the last remaining z-berth based in a commercial uk port .
in the event of a nuclear accident , residents in the 2km zone will be issued with potassium iodate tablets -lrb- pits -rrb- , told not to collect their children from school , to stay inside and not use the telephone .
di mcdonald , of the southampton-based nuclear information service , says the plan , called sotonsafe , will fail in the event of a disaster .
people are told not to collect their children from school and that 's very alarming for parents di mcdonald she told bbc news online : " the council 's position is that they do not want nuclear submarines in the docks , but if they have no choice , they want to protect people .
" if you have a plume of radiation coming over a town then that 's very hard to do .
it really is n't doable for real , ordinary people .
it 's bound to fail .
" people are told not to collect their children from school and that 's very alarming for parents ; teachers might have to administer tablets to children , which they are not qualified to do .
" it 's irresponsible of the navy to insist on bringing a nuclear reactor into the middle of a major city . "
' visit possibly sometime next year ' she said campaigners are also angry the full plan - which took the city council two years to put together after safety responsibilities were passed to them from the navy - is only available at present in public libraries .
a navy spokesman told bbc news online : " there are no plans at the moment to bring a nuclear-powered vessel into southampton - and there wo n't be a visit until the council plan has been exercised and approved by the nuclear installations inspectorate .
" we have never had an accident involving the release of radioactive material into the environment in any of our nuclear subs during the 40 to 50 years we 've been operating them .
" in any event , we do n't discuss movements of subs much before about a week ahead .

campaigners are angry a nuclear vessel may be berthed near the city but emergency planners have given a clear signal that nuclear submarines are to return to southampton , after preparing a similar radiation disaster action plan .
the emergency guidelines advise residents on what to do if a visiting submarine is involved in an accident , releasing radioactive material .
advice will be sent to residents within a 2km radius of southampton 's nuclear berth , prior to a visit .
campaigners are furious nuclear vessels could be berthed so near a major city .
tablets handed out the royal navy has used the so-called z-berth twice in the last six years , according to the city council , which has no say over whether nuclear-powered vessels visit southampton .
it is the last remaining z-berth based in a commercial uk port .
in the event of a nuclear accident , residents in the 2km zone will be issued with potassium iodate tablets -lrb- pits -rrb- , told not to collect their children from school , to stay inside and not use the telephone .
