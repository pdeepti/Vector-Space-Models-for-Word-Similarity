trying to counter anti-american sentiments left over from communist rule , us officials are sending americans to eastern german schools .
experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .
he pointed out that germany remained a " leading country in the war against terrorism " and " really our closest ally in dealing with the part of the world where al qaeda came from - with afghanistan . " he said that no one was more ashamed of the cases of torture at bagdhad 's abu ghraib prison than the american people and asked his audience to be patient with his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john k. bauman talking to students in potsdam .
" watch us , see what happens , " bauman said .
" we 're certain to make some more mistakes .
we 're human , but see if the system of government we have ca n't correct itself . " " normal people " that did n't do the trick for nicole greissel , an 18-year-old junior , who made no secret about the fact that she did n't really like the us . " americans are pretty arrogant and think they 're the best and can do everything they want , " she told dw-world .
" they think they immediately have to get involved if there 's a problem somewhere in the world . " while equally critical of us policy , 19-year-old josef weirauch said he had nothing against americans in general . " they are normal people who try to survive each day , " the senior said .
" it 's actually the same as in germany .
except the oil prices are cheaper and the taxes are not so high and everything looks kind of broken .
but that depends on where you 're living in america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morning sky is set ablaze by the rising sun behind wood island lighthouse off biddeford pool , maine .
weirauch has lived in america : he spent a year at a high school in a portland , maine , suburb , where people did n't have to lock their houses , he said . he 's planning to go back as soon as possible to study and work there - " and to see more about the american way of life , which in my experience is the best thing that i have experienced in my life until now . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern attitudes toward the state recent protests against welfare reforms in germany have been largest in the east .

leverkusen crashed to a 4-2 defeat in a thrilling champions ' league group b encounter on tuesday against dynamo kiev , a marked difference from the 3-0 winning performance in the previous game against real madrid -lrb- photo -rrb- . brazilian striker rincon and romanian midfielder florin cernat both scored doubles for the hosts , while ukrainian international forward andrei voronin and jens nowotny were on target for bayer .
voronin was to end up as the bad boy after he was sent off 11 minutes from time for a second bookable offence as bayer fell flat after their opening 3-0 victory over real madrid . the opponents went at each other at kiev 's 83,000-seater olympic stadium right from the kick-off trying to expose their rival 's defensive frailties .
however , both teams ' defenses stifled the attacking efforts to such an extent that they were limited to trying their luck from long range . thirty minutes into the match the hosts went 1-0 up as rincon fooled paul freier at the left edge of the box , dribbled in and sent the ball into the net with a sharp-angled shot .
three minutes later bernd schneider missed a chance to pull the scores level with a well-struck 22-metre free-kick which hit the woodwork . but after a quarter-hour following the break the visitors equalized through second-half substitute voronin , who shot home on the rebound after dynamo ' keeper alexander shovkovsky deflected robson ponte 's powerful shot from the edge of the box .
bayer rushed ahead and eight minutes later voronin released nowotny into the box and the germans skipper outfoxed shovkovsky and shot into the empty net . but rincon replied immediately with his second of the match from close range after his compatriot kleber fed him in bayer 's box .

how bayer leverkusen must be wishing for a savior like makaay right now .
leverkusen crashed to a 4-2 defeat in a thrilling champions ' league group b encounter on tuesday against dynamo kiev , a marked difference from the 3-0 winning performance in the previous game against real madrid -lrb- photo -rrb- . brazilian striker rincon and romanian midfielder florin cernat both scored doubles for the hosts , while ukrainian international forward andrei voronin and jens nowotny were on target for bayer .
voronin was to end up as the bad boy after he was sent off 11 minutes from time for a second bookable offence as bayer fell flat after their opening 3-0 victory over real madrid . the opponents went at each other at kiev 's 83,000-seater olympic stadium right from the kick-off trying to expose their rival 's defensive frailties .
however , both teams ' defenses stifled the attacking efforts to such an extent that they were limited to trying their luck from long range . thirty minutes into the match the hosts went 1-0 up as rincon fooled paul freier at the left edge of the box , dribbled in and sent the ball into the net with a sharp-angled shot .
three minutes later bernd schneider missed a chance to pull the scores level with a well-struck 22-metre free-kick which hit the woodwork . but after a quarter-hour following the break the visitors equalized through second-half substitute voronin , who shot home on the rebound after dynamo ' keeper alexander shovkovsky deflected robson ponte 's powerful shot from the edge of the box .
bayer rushed ahead and eight minutes later voronin released nowotny into the box and the germans skipper outfoxed shovkovsky and shot into the empty net . but rincon replied immediately with his second of the match from close range after his compatriot kleber fed him in bayer 's box .
dynamo , spurred by a capacity home crowd , poured into attack and late substitute cernat fired dynamo 's third from 11 meters past the outstretched hands of bayer goalkeeper hans-jorg butt . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .
that was underlined by makaay 's first goal . " the modest dutchman insists bayern victories are all that count .
" we are delighted to win and it does not matter who scores the goals , " said makaay .
" i know what i can do and i think people have seen today what bayern are capable of . "

bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .
that was underlined by makaay 's first goal . " the modest dutchman insists bayern victories are all that count .
" we are delighted to win and it does not matter who scores the goals , " said makaay .
" i know what i can do and i think people have seen today what bayern are capable of . "

trying to counter anti-american sentiments left over from communist rule , us officials are sending americans to eastern german schools .
experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .
he pointed out that germany remained a " leading country in the war against terrorism " and " really our closest ally in dealing with the part of the world where al qaeda came from - with afghanistan . " he said that no one was more ashamed of the cases of torture at bagdhad 's abu ghraib prison than the american people and asked his audience to be patient with his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john k. bauman talking to students in potsdam .
" watch us , see what happens , " bauman said .
" we 're certain to make some more mistakes .
we 're human , but see if the system of government we have ca n't correct itself . " " normal people " that did n't do the trick for nicole greissel , an 18-year-old junior , who made no secret about the fact that she did n't really like the us . " americans are pretty arrogant and think they 're the best and can do everything they want , " she told dw-world .
" they think they immediately have to get involved if there 's a problem somewhere in the world . " while equally critical of us policy , 19-year-old josef weirauch said he had nothing against americans in general . " they are normal people who try to survive each day , " the senior said .
" it 's actually the same as in germany .
except the oil prices are cheaper and the taxes are not so high and everything looks kind of broken .
but that depends on where you 're living in america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morning sky is set ablaze by the rising sun behind wood island lighthouse off biddeford pool , maine .
weirauch has lived in america : he spent a year at a high school in a portland , maine , suburb , where people did n't have to lock their houses , he said . he 's planning to go back as soon as possible to study and work there - " and to see more about the american way of life , which in my experience is the best thing that i have experienced in my life until now .

" in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .

when us president george w. bush and senator john kerry go head-to-head in three debates , one german viewer said it will be the politicians ' rhetorical abilities , not content , that decides the winner . like the members of reality television hoping not to get voted off the show , charisma and rhetoric will be more important than the actual message the candidates try to bring across , according to hans vorländer , a political scientist and communications expert at the technical university in dresden .
" both candidates refer to a shared repertoire of campaign rhetoric , to which belong a basic optimistic outlook , a promising spin on the current situation and most of all the embedding of big american values like freedom and advancement , " vorländer said .
" ultimately , the debates are not dominated by content but the candidates ' rhetorical ability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the candidates come across on tv will play a role in what voters think of them in front of an audience of millions , many observers feel the competitors ' performance in the three debates will be a key factor in swaying undecided voters before the nov .
2 elections .
the first debate , which takes place thursday night , will cover foreign politics and security issues , including the fight against terrorism and the war in iraq .
influence undecided voters with current us polls giving bush an advantage of between six and eight points , the debates will be especially important for kerry in his attempt to turn the tide .
polls show that up to a quarter of us voters can be influenced by the debates .
" until now , kerry , as opposed to the president , has not been successful in getting rid of his aloof , stiff image and getting closer to the public , " vorländer said .
" in many respects the debates will decide the election , because that 's where the candidates can win undecided voters . "
two proficient debaters although both campaigns are trying to lower the public 's expectations for their candidate to reap the profits of being the underdog , both men have a reputation for their debating skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush showed voters his debating skills against al gore four years ago bush surprised campaign observers with in his performances against then democratic candidate al gore four years ago , and some of kerry 's campaign debates from 1996 are regarded as modern classics .
though the two men have different debating styles , there is some " civil-religious rhetoric " that connects them , according to vorländer .
" the candidates will stress the motive of the usa as god 's chosen land , as well as striving like missionaries to carry the american dream to the world , " he said .
" the candidate who mixes america 's favorite principles into his rhetoric best scores the most points . " andré moeller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how much damage has bush done ?

the comments came during a hearing in the us house of representatives in the run-up to the october 9 afghan elections . " where is the administration 's outrage over the fact that nato and key allies in the middle east have not only refused to help in iraq , which is a controversial and separate issue , but turned their backs on afghanistan as well , " lantos asked .
he added that president bush 's administration " must be prepared to publicly condemn them for their failure to act . " nato commitment questioned the criticism comes on the heels of nato 's announcement that it would complete expanding its forces in afghanistan this week to meet its commitment for supporting the election .
there are currently around 8,000 nato-led peacekeepers based mainly in kabul . the reinforcements - mostly spanish and italian troops - would bring to around 9,000 the number of troops deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , which nato has run since last year . but the military alliance 's commitment in afghanistan has been thrown in question after much dithering over the need to boost its presence in the country .
additional reinforcements were finally decided after much wrangling at nato 's istanbul summit in june . several european members are believed to be wary of sending troops to the country , which many view as hopelessly lawless and not high enough on their list of priorities . security the main worry on wednesday another democrat representative , shelley berkley from nevada , found fault with nato 's delay on expanding its presence in afghanistan . berkley insisted the us should ensure that european countries as well as egypt and turkey carry " their fair share load in afghanistan . "
she added , " and if they 're not going to provide troops , the least they could do is provide money , of which they 're not doing either . " berkley 's comments however seem to have overlooked the massive aid packages promised by european countries during the afghan donor conference in berlin in april this year .
at the time germany , which has traditionally provided the most financial aid to afghanistan among european countries , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
the european union has pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year . but there remains little doubt that security has been the major concern in the run-up to the afghan elections .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks since august last year .
in the latest incidence of violence , two german soldiers stationed in kunduz were injured in a grenade attack on their camp on wednesday . us allies " fail the moral test " lantos said the europeans owed it to the us to meet commitments in afghanistan given the fact that the us had protected their continent from the soviets for two generations . " we had hundreds of thousands of troops in europe protecting europe .
we succeeded , in large measure , in making europe prosperous .
and europe has simply opted out , with the exception of britain and a few others , from their global responsibilities , " lantos said . deputy secretary of state , richard armitage , lamented the that europe was not more thankful .

the comments came during a hearing in the us house of representatives in the run-up to the october 9 afghan elections . " where is the administration 's outrage over the fact that nato and key allies in the middle east have not only refused to help in iraq , which is a controversial and separate issue , but turned their backs on afghanistan as well , " lantos asked .
he added that president bush 's administration " must be prepared to publicly condemn them for their failure to act . " nato commitment questioned the criticism comes on the heels of nato 's announcement that it would complete expanding its forces in afghanistan this week to meet its commitment for supporting the election .
there are currently around 8,000 nato-led peacekeepers based mainly in kabul . the reinforcements - mostly spanish and italian troops - would bring to around 9,000 the number of troops deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , which nato has run since last year . but the military alliance 's commitment in afghanistan has been thrown in question after much dithering over the need to boost its presence in the country .
additional reinforcements were finally decided after much wrangling at nato 's istanbul summit in june . several european members are believed to be wary of sending troops to the country , which many view as hopelessly lawless and not high enough on their list of priorities . security the main worry on wednesday another democrat representative , shelley berkley from nevada , found fault with nato 's delay on expanding its presence in afghanistan . berkley insisted the us should ensure that european countries as well as egypt and turkey carry " their fair share load in afghanistan . "
she added , " and if they 're not going to provide troops , the least they could do is provide money , of which they 're not doing either . " berkley 's comments however seem to have overlooked the massive aid packages promised by european countries during the afghan donor conference in berlin in april this year .
at the time germany , which has traditionally provided the most financial aid to afghanistan among european countries , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
the european union has pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year . but there remains little doubt that security has been the major concern in the run-up to the afghan elections .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks since august last year .
in the latest incidence of violence , two german soldiers stationed in kunduz were injured in a grenade attack on their camp on wednesday . us allies " fail the moral test " lantos said the europeans owed it to the us to meet commitments in afghanistan given the fact that the us had protected their continent from the soviets for two generations . " we had hundreds of thousands of troops in europe protecting europe .
we succeeded , in large measure , in making europe prosperous .
and europe has simply opted out , with the exception of britain and a few others , from their global responsibilities , " lantos said . deputy secretary of state , richard armitage , lamented the that europe was not more thankful .

the comments came during a hearing in the us house of representatives in the run-up to the october 9 afghan elections .

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .
germany has one of the world 's five biggest music markets .
but its industry has suffered a downturn since 1997 , with turnover dropping 40 percent .
only 55 percent of the country 's best-selling artists are german . " it is often said that whoever makes good music will get on the radio , but that is just not true , " said björn akstinat , president of the german music export office during a seminar at popkomm .
and micha rhein of german band in extremo told reporters : " our record was at number three in the charts for weeks but our promoters had to fight to get the song played on the radio - it 's a cheek . " konrad kuhnt , chief editor at berlin-based radio fritz , said his station could only succeed if it chose the best music .
" it is not true that we would n't play the music .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner , former head of germany 's universal music division tim renner from record label motor music and former head of universal germany backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .

" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . " artists protest over 500 artists signed a plea against what they dubbed " scandalous under-representation " of german-speaking artists in a radio format carved out of " the anglo-american mainstream and the usual oldies . "
supporting them was jacques toubon , former french culture minister , brainchild of france 's quota . he told the parliamentary committee that thanks to his law , french music sales have picked up and new french artists are no longer trees falling in the forest that nobody hears .
record industry executives from all around the world warned a quota was n't a cure-all - especially those from non-english speaking countries . the head of a danish record label was quoted as saying the law would make it that much harder for music from denmark - which is n't exactly breaking through the charts right now - to sell in germany . german pop music , unlike french and spanish , has always had trouble selling abroad . if germans do n't buy it , it might never be made .

bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .
that was underlined by makaay 's first goal . " the modest dutchman insists bayern victories are all that count .
" we are delighted to win and it does not matter who scores the goals , " said makaay .
" i know what i can do and i think people have seen today what bayern are capable of . "

several dioceses admit they 're facing a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions . several dioceses in germany are looking for ways to tighten the belt even further as funds dry up and parishes become too expensive to run .

the bishop of aachen , heinrich mussinghoff , said on wednesday that the economic changes for the catholic community in aachen are coming " faster and more thoroughly than ever before in the church 's history in germany . "
" we ca n't continue to offer our full spectrum of programs , and a lot of our facilities and services will have to go , " mussinghoff said .
a third of the diocese 's staff - around 220 jobs - will be cut as part of the savings plans aimed at stopping up a gaping hole in the church 's coffers .
the opening hours of the aachen cathedral - one of the oldest in germany and a major tourist attraction - may also have to be shortened .

the church has little choice but to undergo what it calls a " consolidation process . "
the number of parishes in each diocese will be reduced , and the number of full-time ministerial and administrative jobs decreased by around 20 percent , meaning those remaining in the church 's employment will have to cover larger geographical areas .
another savings option that has n't been ruled out yet is the sale of church buildings .

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .
germany has one of the world 's five biggest music markets .
but its industry has suffered a downturn since 1997 , with turnover dropping 40 percent .
only 55 percent of the country 's best-selling artists are german . " it is often said that whoever makes good music will get on the radio , but that is just not true , " said björn akstinat , president of the german music export office during a seminar at popkomm .
and micha rhein of german band in extremo told reporters : " our record was at number three in the charts for weeks but our promoters had to fight to get the song played on the radio - it 's a cheek . " konrad kuhnt , chief editor at berlin-based radio fritz , said his station could only succeed if it chose the best music .
" it is not true that we would n't play the music .
we wish we had the material to present to our listeners when they say they want more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner , former head of germany 's universal music division tim renner from record label motor music and former head of universal germany backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
" i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . " artists protest over 500 artists signed a plea against what they dubbed " scandalous under-representation " of german-speaking artists in a radio format carved out of " the anglo-american mainstream and the usual oldies . "
supporting them was jacques toubon , former french culture minister , brainchild of france 's quota . he told the parliamentary committee that thanks to his law , french music sales have picked up and new french artists are no longer trees falling in the forest that nobody hears .
record industry executives from all around the world warned a quota was n't a cure-all - especially those from non-english speaking countries . the head of a danish record label was quoted as saying the law would make it that much harder for music from denmark - which is n't exactly breaking through the charts right now - to sell in germany . german pop music , unlike french and spanish , has always had trouble selling abroad . if germans do n't buy it , it might never be made .
there 's no spiral effect , where more sales means more money and thus higher quality music .
supporters of a quota want to set that spiral in motion dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can berlin save german pop ?

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .

osce monitors will observe voting in the us for the first time in november . while the report released by the osce this week praised the united states for its “ vibrant civil society , ” it said weaknesses in the voting system that were revealed in florida and other states during the 2000 presidential elections have shaken voter confidence . us president george w. bush won that election amid widespread criticism that voting was marred in several states .
in florida , voters said that selecting candidates with punch-cards was confusing and led them to choose candidates they did not mean to vote for . a team of five election experts who visited the united states in early september drafted the assessment and outlined potential problems after examining preparations for the plebiscite and talking with us election authorities , political parties , and organizations concerned about democratic processes .

thanks to digital cameras , picture taking has been revitalized .
at this year 's photokina , the world 's largest photography trade fair , digital cameras dominate the picture . " smile , please ! "
that should n't be too difficult for this year 's exhibitors as they expect sales to continue rising .
this year the german photographic and imaging industry anticipated taking in € 10 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in sales , an increase of almost 8 percent .
although the traditional film business has crashed in recent years , the increasing trend toward digital cameras , which have gone up by 20 percent , has more than compensated for the loss .
however , even more popular than digital cameras are cell phone cameras .
cell phone cameras : the latest trend the photo industry expects to sell 13 million cell phone cameras this year - three times more than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympus ' mju mini digital camera " young people are much more communicative , and the cell phone camera is a device for snapshots and entertainment , " said wolfdieter gries , head of sony in germany .
at the fair , sony presented a fold-out mobile phone with a 2.3-inch screen and a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera .
the device also has radio reception over the headset and can even act as a mp3 player .
" the camera phone will , sooner or later , surpass snapshot cameras , however not normal analog cameras , " predicted helmut rupsch , a member of germany 's national photo industry association .
" as a branch there will be potential again since the pictures will need to be printed . "
due to the fusion of electronics and optics , there is an increasing number of newcomers to the photo sector .
sony , hewlett packard and adobe are all trying to snap up a share of the booming market .
on the other hand the likes of kodak , agfa and other traditional photo companies are struggling with declining turnover .
agfa , a belgian company , cut its losses and sold its film and picture businesses .
there was no help for ilford , a bankruptcy judge has taken over for the british film manufacture 's management .
digital gadget innovation continues meanwhile , innovations for digital camera gadgets continue outdoing each other .
new models are released almost every third month and the price battle is becoming more and more competitive all the time .
" it is very regrettable that our growth market has to fight with increasingly tighter margins , " said rainer schmidt , general manager of germany 's national photo industry association .
" this hurts the industry , and it hurts retail sales . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fujifilm 's s3500 selling printing paper for a few cents below purchase cost does n't make sense either , he lamented , but others in the photo industry say there is still room for profit in the digital camera market , despite its knockdown prices .
digital camera market concentration is still below 30 percent , compared to 80 percent for analog cameras , and a survey showed every fourth german is considering buying a digital camera within the next 12 months .
plenty of market potential compact cameras in the four to eight megapixel range with built-in zoom lenses remain the consumers ' favorite .
the average german consumer spends about € 290 for a digital camera .
" the erosion of prices is quite dramatic , " sony head griess said .
" its a very competitive market with tight margins . "
further enhancements will no longer focus so much on the number of pixels but on lenses , shutter speed and other features .
analog single lens reflex cameras will also profit from the advancements .
thanks to their affordable prices , sales from 500 percent in the first half of 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing cameras at photokina but the photo industry association also sees great potential in non-camera technology .
" the camera market pushes the market for storage media , film , memory cards , as well as lenses , software , ink jet cartridges , printing paper and let 's not forget printers and mini-labs , " he said .
at the moment only about 20 percent of stored images are being printed .
one reason is that up to now , a computer and a picture printer were needed for the lengthy home-printing process or consumers had to send their pictures to a developing service .
but this is also set to change ... sooner or later . wiebke bomas -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lights , mobile phone , action gone are the days when mobile phones served just one piffling function : that of a telephone .
they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin .
-lrb- aug .
31 , 2004 -rrb- third generation mobile phones arrive in germany it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany .

thanks to digital cameras , picture taking has been revitalized .
at this year 's photokina , the world 's largest photography trade fair , digital cameras dominate the picture . " smile , please ! "
that should n't be too difficult for this year 's exhibitors as they expect sales to continue rising .
this year the german photographic and imaging industry anticipated taking in € 10 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in sales , an increase of almost 8 percent .
although the traditional film business has crashed in recent years , the increasing trend toward digital cameras , which have gone up by 20 percent , has more than compensated for the loss .
however , even more popular than digital cameras are cell phone cameras .
cell phone cameras : the latest trend the photo industry expects to sell 13 million cell phone cameras this year - three times more than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympus ' mju mini digital camera " young people are much more communicative , and the cell phone camera is a device for snapshots and entertainment , " said wolfdieter gries , head of sony in germany .
at the fair , sony presented a fold-out mobile phone with a 2.3-inch screen and a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera .
the device also has radio reception over the headset and can even act as a mp3 player .
" the camera phone will , sooner or later , surpass snapshot cameras , however not normal analog cameras , " predicted helmut rupsch , a member of germany 's national photo industry association .
" as a branch there will be potential again since the pictures will need to be printed . "

the decision comes a day after a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz injured five . a large majority of social democrat , green and opposition conservative christian democratic parliaments voted in favor of extending the german armed forces mandate in afghanistan for another year . the extension ensures that a maximum number of 2,250 german troops can continue their role in the multi-national isaf nato-led peacekeeping force in kabul and its surroundings as well as their work in two provincial reconstruction teams in kunduz and faizabad in northern afghanistan . the current mandate of the german troops expires on oct.13.

thursday 's decision comes on the heels of another surge in violence in afghanistan . on wednesday , a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz in northeastern afghanistan injured five soldiers , three of them german .
though the soldiers are now said to be out of danger , the incident underlined the continuing danger and security threat in the volatile country . earlier german defense minister peter struck said he saw no connection between wednesday ’ s rocket attack and the prolongation of the bundeswehr mandate .
struck said the attack was a sign that the extension of the mandate " should n't be seen as simply routine . " " there is no one hundred percent guarantee against attacks of this kind , " struck said , adding that german soldiers in afghanistan were n't questioning their commitment there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck , left , with bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan struck also said that attacks had been expected in the run-up to the october 9th presidential election in afghanistan . “ our teams in northern afghanistan will be reinforced early next year by 80 troops from the czech republic and denmark , " he said .
" we ’ re convinced that our efforts to stabilize peace and security in the region will not be in vain . " the german government has been supported by the cdu in its commitment in afghanistan . " you ca n't withdraw soldiers just because it really is getting dangerous , " christian schmidt , the cdu 's parliamentary spokesman on defense affairs , said on thursday .

fdp defense spokesman werner hoyer also criticized that the original concept of building up a network of provisional reconstruction teams across the country had not materialized in any way , as other nato members had not provided enough resources to join the campaign . “ a closely-knit network of prts across afghanistan would be required to extend the central government ’ s influence to the provinces which are mostly under the control of warlords , " hoyer said .

the decision comes a day after a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz injured five . a large majority of social democrat , green and opposition conservative christian democratic parliaments voted in favor of extending the german armed forces mandate in afghanistan for another year . the extension ensures that a maximum number of 2,250 german troops can continue their role in the multi-national isaf nato-led peacekeeping force in kabul and its surroundings as well as their work in two provincial reconstruction teams in kunduz and faizabad in northern afghanistan . the current mandate of the german troops expires on oct.13. " no guarantee against attacks " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers carry a coffin of a colleague who was killed along with three other german soldiers in a bomb attack in kabul on june 7 , 2003 .
thursday 's decision comes on the heels of another surge in violence in afghanistan . on wednesday , a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz in northeastern afghanistan injured five soldiers , three of them german .
though the soldiers are now said to be out of danger , the incident underlined the continuing danger and security threat in the volatile country . earlier german defense minister peter struck said he saw no connection between wednesday ’ s rocket attack and the prolongation of the bundeswehr mandate .
struck said the attack was a sign that the extension of the mandate " should n't be seen as simply routine . " " there is no one hundred percent guarantee against attacks of this kind , " struck said , adding that german soldiers in afghanistan were n't questioning their commitment there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck , left , with bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan struck also said that attacks had been expected in the run-up to the october 9th presidential election in afghanistan . “ our teams in northern afghanistan will be reinforced early next year by 80 troops from the czech republic and denmark , " he said .
" we ’ re convinced that our efforts to stabilize peace and security in the region will not be in vain . " the german government has been supported by the cdu in its commitment in afghanistan . " you ca n't withdraw soldiers just because it really is getting dangerous , " christian schmidt , the cdu 's parliamentary spokesman on defense affairs , said on thursday .
at the same time the party has emphasized that the contingents in northern afghanistan had to be beefed up to be made more secure . fdp : half-hearted mission but like in the past , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- remained opposed to an extended mandate . fdp parliamentarians said the work of the provincial reconstruction teams there could not be called a success story , as their mission did not include the fight against drug cultivation and trafficking .
fdp defense spokesman werner hoyer also criticized that the original concept of building up a network of provisional reconstruction teams across the country had not materialized in any way , as other nato members had not provided enough resources to join the campaign . “ a closely-knit network of prts across afghanistan would be required to extend the central government ’ s influence to the provinces which are mostly under the control of warlords , " hoyer said .
" but apart from a few exceptions in the north , nothing has happened on this front so far .
and i can ’ t see much progress being made in the months to come despite the desperate campaigning by the nato secretary-general in recent weeks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai signs on his election registration card in kabul in january , 2004 the fdp believes that it would have been a better idea to separate the uncontroversial mandate for kabul from the one for northern afghanistan .
there is cross-party agreement , though , that a withdrawal of troops in general would have sent a devastating political signal to the karzai government . schröder might drop afghanistan visit however , wednesday ’ s rocket attack may have changed chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s original decision to visit kabul on oct .
11 as part of his planned tour of asia next week . a spokesman for the chancellery said on thursday that the security situation on the ground would be followed closely .
a final decision on whether schröder would include kabul in his itinerary would only be taken at a date close to his departure for asia , he added . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

thanks to digital cameras , picture taking has been revitalized .
at this year 's photokina , the world 's largest photography trade fair , digital cameras dominate the picture . " smile , please ! "
that should n't be too difficult for this year 's exhibitors as they expect sales to continue rising .
this year the german photographic and imaging industry anticipated taking in € 10 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in sales , an increase of almost 8 percent .
although the traditional film business has crashed in recent years , the increasing trend toward digital cameras , which have gone up by 20 percent , has more than compensated for the loss .
however , even more popular than digital cameras are cell phone cameras .
cell phone cameras : the latest trend the photo industry expects to sell 13 million cell phone cameras this year - three times more than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympus ' mju mini digital camera " young people are much more communicative , and the cell phone camera is a device for snapshots and entertainment , " said wolfdieter gries , head of sony in germany .
at the fair , sony presented a fold-out mobile phone with a 2.3-inch screen and a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera .
the device also has radio reception over the headset and can even act as a mp3 player .
" the camera phone will , sooner or later , surpass snapshot cameras , however not normal analog cameras , " predicted helmut rupsch , a member of germany 's national photo industry association .
" as a branch there will be potential again since the pictures will need to be printed . "
due to the fusion of electronics and optics , there is an increasing number of newcomers to the photo sector .
sony , hewlett packard and adobe are all trying to snap up a share of the booming market .
on the other hand the likes of kodak , agfa and other traditional photo companies are struggling with declining turnover .
agfa , a belgian company , cut its losses and sold its film and picture businesses .
there was no help for ilford , a bankruptcy judge has taken over for the british film manufacture 's management .
digital gadget innovation continues meanwhile , innovations for digital camera gadgets continue outdoing each other .
new models are released almost every third month and the price battle is becoming more and more competitive all the time .
" it is very regrettable that our growth market has to fight with increasingly tighter margins , " said rainer schmidt , general manager of germany 's national photo industry association .
" this hurts the industry , and it hurts retail sales . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fujifilm 's s3500 selling printing paper for a few cents below purchase cost does n't make sense either , he lamented , but others in the photo industry say there is still room for profit in the digital camera market , despite its knockdown prices .
digital camera market concentration is still below 30 percent , compared to 80 percent for analog cameras , and a survey showed every fourth german is considering buying a digital camera within the next 12 months .
plenty of market potential compact cameras in the four to eight megapixel range with built-in zoom lenses remain the consumers ' favorite .
the average german consumer spends about € 290 for a digital camera .
" the erosion of prices is quite dramatic , " sony head griess said .
" its a very competitive market with tight margins . "
further enhancements will no longer focus so much on the number of pixels but on lenses , shutter speed and other features .
analog single lens reflex cameras will also profit from the advancements .
thanks to their affordable prices , sales from 500 percent in the first half of 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing cameras at photokina but the photo industry association also sees great potential in non-camera technology .
" the camera market pushes the market for storage media , film , memory cards , as well as lenses , software , ink jet cartridges , printing paper and let 's not forget printers and mini-labs , " he said .
at the moment only about 20 percent of stored images are being printed .
one reason is that up to now , a computer and a picture printer were needed for the lengthy home-printing process or consumers had to send their pictures to a developing service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.09.2004 opinion : double standards at work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants to deliver 20 armored tanks to the iraqi military as the green party criticizes berlin 's decision to supply iraq with fuchs armored personnel carriers , deutsche welle 's peter philipp questions the reasons for the german change of tack in iraq . on wednesday , co-chair of the greens , angelika beer , questioned chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to provide iraq with 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers .
" it does n't make any sense to export arms to a country where currently everything is in disarray , " beer told the daily berliner zeitung . she also pointed out that iraq was still in a state of war and cast doubt on whether the armored personnel carriers would be used by iraqi security officials only for self-defense .
" how can you check whether the carriers wo n't be belatedly armed and used in fights against the insurgents ? "
beer asked . criticism is growing of germany 's decision , particularly in light of the fact that berlin was a staunch opponent of the us-led iraq war and chancellor schröder has vowed not to send any soldiers to iraq .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments on the issue . germany not adhering to principles germany has principles , but it does n't seem to be sticking to them .
german weapons are n't allowed to be exported outside nato to volatile regions , which suppress human rights and where civil war-like conditions prevail . that is a good tenet stemming from the time when the federal republic of germany was " noble and good " and did n't want to have anything more to do with the conflicts of the world .
violations of this tenet were pursued such as in the cases of libya and saddam hussein . and now germany wants to deliver fuchs armored personnel carriers to iraq despite the fact that the country fulfills all the criteria that would amount to a breach of the maxim . german arms suppliers , who have sidestepped german law and exported strategically important goods to such countries , have been charged and sentenced . naturally , there have also been official deliveries of weapons to states like saudi arabia , which certainly qualify as volatile regions .
but here germany hid behind excuses such as cooperation with other european partners . in other cases , the circumstances surrounding the transaction were considered more scandalous because it seemed that bribes and corruption was involved . israel the only exception the only exception so far has always been israel .
against the background of german-jewish history and the holocaust , germany has always supplied weapons to israel .
despite the fact that israel is a " crisis region . "
the weapon deliveries go as far as german submarines outfitted with atomic rockets .
germany has almost never turned down israeli arms requests and has always argued that they were meant to provide security for a state threatened with destruction . it 's only in the run-up to the iraq war that german policy regarding the export of arms has begun to change .
last year israel ordered fuchs armored personnel carriers and german defense minister peter struck hastily said " yes " .
he said he thought jerusalem had asked for the enhanced fuchs model outfitted to counter nuclear , biological and chemical attack because it would have to reckon with attacks by weapons of mass destruction from baghdad during the iraq war . but it soon turned out that israel wanted to have the standard fuchs armored personnel carriers - something that it could naturally use against the palestinians .
berlin then backed down and said it could n't help . a slipping of the ban ? and now germany wants to deliver the same fuchs armored carriers to iraq .
the reason ?
berlin says it 's ready to train iraqi security troops in neighboring abu dhabi and that 's why it also wants to grant the trainees the protection of german fuchs tanks . naturally , one can explain , elaborate and sweet-talk everything - the delivery of submarines to israel as well as the refusal to supply armored personnel carriers to the same country .
as well as the offer of the very same vehicle to iraq . there 's no doubt that the world has changed and germany no longer has to fulfill its duties as a country on the border of the cold war sectors .
and naturally , one can expect that the opposition would want to surge ahead much faster with weapons exports than the government does . but , against such a background , the last remnants of the once well-intentioned german abstinence in weapons exports now threaten to slip away . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday .

" it does n't make any sense to export arms to a country where currently everything is in disarray , " beer told the daily berliner zeitung . she also pointed out that iraq was still in a state of war and cast doubt on whether the armored personnel carriers would be used by iraqi security officials only for self-defense .
" how can you check whether the carriers wo n't be belatedly armed and used in fights against the insurgents ? "
beer asked . criticism is growing of germany 's decision , particularly in light of the fact that berlin was a staunch opponent of the us-led iraq war and chancellor schröder has vowed not to send any soldiers to iraq .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments on the issue . germany not adhering to principles germany has principles , but it does n't seem to be sticking to them .
german weapons are n't allowed to be exported outside nato to volatile regions , which suppress human rights and where civil war-like conditions prevail . that is a good tenet stemming from the time when the federal republic of germany was " noble and good " and did n't want to have anything more to do with the conflicts of the world .
violations of this tenet were pursued such as in the cases of libya and saddam hussein . and now germany wants to deliver fuchs armored personnel carriers to iraq despite the fact that the country fulfills all the criteria that would amount to a breach of the maxim . german arms suppliers , who have sidestepped german law and exported strategically important goods to such countries , have been charged and sentenced . naturally , there have also been official deliveries of weapons to states like saudi arabia , which certainly qualify as volatile regions .
but here germany hid behind excuses such as cooperation with other european partners . in other cases , the circumstances surrounding the transaction were considered more scandalous because it seemed that bribes and corruption was involved . israel the only exception the only exception so far has always been israel .
against the background of german-jewish history and the holocaust , germany has always supplied weapons to israel .
despite the fact that israel is a " crisis region . "
the weapon deliveries go as far as german submarines outfitted with atomic rockets .
germany has almost never turned down israeli arms requests and has always argued that they were meant to provide security for a state threatened with destruction . it 's only in the run-up to the iraq war that german policy regarding the export of arms has begun to change .
last year israel ordered fuchs armored personnel carriers and german defense minister peter struck hastily said " yes " .
he said he thought jerusalem had asked for the enhanced fuchs model outfitted to counter nuclear , biological and chemical attack because it would have to reckon with attacks by weapons of mass destruction from baghdad during the iraq war . but it soon turned out that israel wanted to have the standard fuchs armored personnel carriers - something that it could naturally use against the palestinians .
berlin then backed down and said it could n't help . a slipping of the ban ? and now germany wants to deliver the same fuchs armored carriers to iraq .
the reason ?
berlin says it 's ready to train iraqi security troops in neighboring abu dhabi and that 's why it also wants to grant the trainees the protection of german fuchs tanks . naturally , one can explain , elaborate and sweet-talk everything - the delivery of submarines to israel as well as the refusal to supply armored personnel carriers to the same country .
as well as the offer of the very same vehicle to iraq . there 's no doubt that the world has changed and germany no longer has to fulfill its duties as a country on the border of the cold war sectors .
and naturally , one can expect that the opposition would want to surge ahead much faster with weapons exports than the government does . but , against such a background , the last remnants of the once well-intentioned german abstinence in weapons exports now threaten to slip away . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday .

violations of this tenet were pursued such as in the cases of libya and saddam hussein . and now germany wants to deliver fuchs armored personnel carriers to iraq despite the fact that the country fulfills all the criteria that would amount to a breach of the maxim . german arms suppliers , who have sidestepped german law and exported strategically important goods to such countries , have been charged and sentenced . naturally , there have also been official deliveries of weapons to states like saudi arabia , which certainly qualify as volatile regions .
but here germany hid behind excuses such as cooperation with other european partners . in other cases , the circumstances surrounding the transaction were considered more scandalous because it seemed that bribes and corruption was involved . israel the only exception the only exception so far has always been israel .
against the background of german-jewish history and the holocaust , germany has always supplied weapons to israel .
despite the fact that israel is a " crisis region . "
the weapon deliveries go as far as german submarines outfitted with atomic rockets .
germany has almost never turned down israeli arms requests and has always argued that they were meant to provide security for a state threatened with destruction . it 's only in the run-up to the iraq war that german policy regarding the export of arms has begun to change .
last year israel ordered fuchs armored personnel carriers and german defense minister peter struck hastily said " yes " .
he said he thought jerusalem had asked for the enhanced fuchs model outfitted to counter nuclear , biological and chemical attack because it would have to reckon with attacks by weapons of mass destruction from baghdad during the iraq war . but it soon turned out that israel wanted to have the standard fuchs armored personnel carriers - something that it could naturally use against the palestinians .
berlin then backed down and said it could n't help . a slipping of the ban ? and now germany wants to deliver the same fuchs armored carriers to iraq .
the reason ?
berlin says it 's ready to train iraqi security troops in neighboring abu dhabi and that 's why it also wants to grant the trainees the protection of german fuchs tanks . naturally , one can explain , elaborate and sweet-talk everything - the delivery of submarines to israel as well as the refusal to supply armored personnel carriers to the same country .
as well as the offer of the very same vehicle to iraq . there 's no doubt that the world has changed and germany no longer has to fulfill its duties as a country on the border of the cold war sectors .
and naturally , one can expect that the opposition would want to surge ahead much faster with weapons exports than the government does . but , against such a background , the last remnants of the once well-intentioned german abstinence in weapons exports now threaten to slip away . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live can berlin save german pop ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.09.2004 netting the big fish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry 's nightmare - illegal downloads at the berlin music trade fair , popkomm , the nightmare of every music executive again takes center stage : internet piracy .
despite tougher laws , users who download illegally still have little to fear . it 's still the big topic at the world 's largest music fair , hosted this year in berlin .
just as in years past , the industry is tormented by falling sales figures - and blaming those swashbuckling internet pirates . they still prefer to steal music from the internet , rather than buy it .
but , hang on .
the days when surfers could blatantly steal songs and films with impunity are supposed to be over , are n't they ? german justice minister brigitte zypries said that starting in mid-2005 , those who illegally download music , films and software will have to run from the law .
the proposed punishment is up to three years in prison plus a fine . trust your gut but the lines are blurry .
according to zypries , the downloading of music files is still generally allowed .
she 's appealing to internet users on music swap sites to use their common sense . " you can do it within limits , as long as you have the feeling that what you 're doing is n't illegal " zypries said to users at large .
" if you have the feeling it is illegal , then you 'd better not do it . " hapless users , then , should rely on gut feelings to tell them whether or not they 're operating within the law , or whether they 're stealing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting mid-2005 , making private copies from one 's own collection of copyrighted cds and dvds will also be illegal .
non-copyrighted cds and dvds , however , can continue to be copied and distributed to friends .
still , around 90 percent of the music , films and software available on internet swap sites is guaranteed to be legally off-limits . difficult to prosecute but that does n't much impress the users of such web sites .
germany has around seven million internet pirates , and they are the ones who 've given the music industry something to fear .
the chances that police officers will make millions of house calls are slim . technically , it 's easy to trace the pirates , because with every transaction , they leave behind their ip address .
that 's like the computer leaving its fingerprints at the scene of the crime .
but a quick get-away is still possible , because the sheer number of illegal downloads means that the internet police have more information than they can possibly process . that 's why the society for copyright protection -lrb- gvu -rrb- in hamburg has offered a helping hand .
but rather than going after the occasional , private offender , they 've got their sights fixed on the big fish .
but who are the big fish ? " for us , the criteria is that there 's a flow of money involved , " said jochen tielke , the head of the gvu .
" we 're interested in those who want to earn money through their criminal behavior .
the user who downloads a film once in a while is not an interesting target for us . " when a small fish accidentally gets caught in the net , judges often do n't know what to do .
the justice ministry has n't come up with exact guidelines as to who counts as a big fish , and who 's among the small fry . " the justice ministry is n't responsible for that , that 's what the state prosecutors do , and that 's a matter for the individual states , " zypries said . the result is that the entertainment industry is going to have swallow further losses through piracy , because millions of hobby pirates on the internet are the ones calling the tune . ulrich anders -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can berlin save german pop ?
many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads .

despite tougher laws , users who download illegally still have little to fear . it 's still the big topic at the world 's largest music fair , hosted this year in berlin .
just as in years past , the industry is tormented by falling sales figures - and blaming those swashbuckling internet pirates . they still prefer to steal music from the internet , rather than buy it .
but , hang on .
the days when surfers could blatantly steal songs and films with impunity are supposed to be over , are n't they ? german justice minister brigitte zypries said that starting in mid-2005 , those who illegally download music , films and software will have to run from the law .
the proposed punishment is up to three years in prison plus a fine . trust your gut but the lines are blurry .
according to zypries , the downloading of music files is still generally allowed .
she 's appealing to internet users on music swap sites to use their common sense . " you can do it within limits , as long as you have the feeling that what you 're doing is n't illegal " zypries said to users at large .
" if you have the feeling it is illegal , then you 'd better not do it .

the cabinet would rubber stamp the higher-than-anticipated deficit in a supplementary budget next wednesday , eichel told the german lower parliamentary house , the bundestag .
at € 43.7 billion , the budget deficit is about 50 percent wider than originally planned .
eichel blamed the development on lower sales and income tax revenues , as well as falling petrol and tobacco tax revenues .
" the economy is growing , but tax revenues are still declining , " eichel said .
in addition , high unemployment was also weighing on the federal budget .
the minister said the sum could be revised again following the completion of the tax estimates in november .
the previous deficit record was set in 1996 when theo waigel , finance minister under then-chancellor helmut kohl , ran up a deficit of about 80 billion deutsche marks , equivalent to around € 40 billion .

ngos have vowed to fight a german proposal for the eu to set up refugee asylum camps in northern africa . eu justice and interior ministers on thursday look set to throw their weight behind german interior minister otto schily 's concept of asylum centers in libya , tunisia and more northern african countries .
but non-governmental organizations such as amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- and germany 's pro-asyl are up in arms over the idea , which they view as a fierce attack on international asylum laws . ai and other ngos would fight tooth and nail the setting up of such camps , if only on the grounds that refugees would have no guarantee that their asylum applications will be looked into in a thorough manner , ai germany 's julia duchrow told reporters in berlin on wednesday " we think that those camps will not guarantee that refugees are protected , " duchrow said .
" we think that it is not possible to guarantee that someone can appeal against the decision by eu officials who are deciding who is in need of protection and who is not . " thirty to 60 percent of all people with refugee status in the european union were only recognized as such after appealed initial decisions that said they were not refugees , ai said in a press release . amnesty also warned that plans to harmonize eu asylum practices - which would allow countries to deport asylum seekers to third countries outside the bloc - are going the wrong way .
refugees could thus be sent to countries where human rights and the protection of refugees are n't guaranteed .
" deportation to ukraine or the russian federation , for example , would be a blatant violation of international refugee law , " ai 's wolfgang grenz said . " europe dodges responsibility " duchrow said that asylum camps in northern africa would be used an instrument for europe to dodge its responsibility to deal with refugee crises .
she refused to accept the argument that the very existence of such camps would prevent any refugees from trying to make it to europe on their own or with the help of traffickers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- has defended his conviction that refugee detention camps need to be set up in northern africa to prevent thousands of more people from risking their lives while trying to reach the european mainland in dangerously rickety vessels .
on wednesday , he reiterated his stance while talking to a parliamentary panel of interior affairs experts in berlin .
schily has already received the backing of the italian government which has had to grapple with tens of thousands of african refugees in recent years . despite fierce resistance from the german green party , schily ’ s proposal has found acceptance among other politicians .
social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspuetz said it should first and foremost be seen as a humanitarian offer .
he dismissed as groundless objections that such camps would undermine the very essence of the geneva convention on refugees . camps no matter what during a recent trip to tripoli , italian interior minister giuseppe pisano said plans to set up asylum camps in libya would go ahead no matter what .
italy also signed an agreement with libya on the training of local police to crack down on illegal immigrants . amnesty ’ s julia duchrow expressed shock at the fact that libya was being seen by eu officials as a suitable location for asylum centers . " we have great , great problems with the human rights situation in libya , and we know of many people , from eritrea for example , who have been detained in libya , " duchrow said .
" they have been sent back then to eritrea and are now in military camps .
we fear that they are tortured and we ca n't get access to them . " closer cooperation between libya and the eu comes in the wake of the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on that african country in 1986 .
libya is used as a starting point for thousands of immigrants landing on italian shores every year . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks to africa for refugee solution eu justice and interior ministers are expected to discuss plans for an eu asylum center in africa at a meeting this week .

ngos have vowed to fight a german proposal for the eu to set up refugee asylum camps in northern africa . eu justice and interior ministers on thursday look set to throw their weight behind german interior minister otto schily 's concept of asylum centers in libya , tunisia and more northern african countries .
but non-governmental organizations such as amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- and germany 's pro-asyl are up in arms over the idea , which they view as a fierce attack on international asylum laws . ai and other ngos would fight tooth and nail the setting up of such camps , if only on the grounds that refugees would have no guarantee that their asylum applications will be looked into in a thorough manner , ai germany 's julia duchrow told reporters in berlin on wednesday " we think that those camps will not guarantee that refugees are protected , " duchrow said .
" we think that it is not possible to guarantee that someone can appeal against the decision by eu officials who are deciding who is in need of protection and who is not . " thirty to 60 percent of all people with refugee status in the european union were only recognized as such after appealed initial decisions that said they were not refugees , ai said in a press release . amnesty also warned that plans to harmonize eu asylum practices - which would allow countries to deport asylum seekers to third countries outside the bloc - are going the wrong way .
refugees could thus be sent to countries where human rights and the protection of refugees are n't guaranteed .
" deportation to ukraine or the russian federation , for example , would be a blatant violation of international refugee law , " ai 's wolfgang grenz said . " europe dodges responsibility " duchrow said that asylum camps in northern africa would be used an instrument for europe to dodge its responsibility to deal with refugee crises .
she refused to accept the argument that the very existence of such camps would prevent any refugees from trying to make it to europe on their own or with the help of traffickers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- has defended his conviction that refugee detention camps need to be set up in northern africa to prevent thousands of more people from risking their lives while trying to reach the european mainland in dangerously rickety vessels .
on wednesday , he reiterated his stance while talking to a parliamentary panel of interior affairs experts in berlin .
schily has already received the backing of the italian government which has had to grapple with tens of thousands of african refugees in recent years . despite fierce resistance from the german green party , schily ’ s proposal has found acceptance among other politicians .
social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspuetz said it should first and foremost be seen as a humanitarian offer .
he dismissed as groundless objections that such camps would undermine the very essence of the geneva convention on refugees . camps no matter what during a recent trip to tripoli , italian interior minister giuseppe pisano said plans to set up asylum camps in libya would go ahead no matter what .
italy also signed an agreement with libya on the training of local police to crack down on illegal immigrants . amnesty ’ s julia duchrow expressed shock at the fact that libya was being seen by eu officials as a suitable location for asylum centers . " we have great , great problems with the human rights situation in libya , and we know of many people , from eritrea for example , who have been detained in libya , " duchrow said .
" they have been sent back then to eritrea and are now in military camps .
we fear that they are tortured and we ca n't get access to them . " closer cooperation between libya and the eu comes in the wake of the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on that african country in 1986 .
libya is used as a starting point for thousands of immigrants landing on italian shores every year . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks to africa for refugee solution eu justice and interior ministers are expected to discuss plans for an eu asylum center in africa at a meeting this week .

trying to counter anti-american sentiments left over from communist rule , us officials are sending americans to eastern german schools .
experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .
he pointed out that germany remained a " leading country in the war against terrorism " and " really our closest ally in dealing with the part of the world where al qaeda came from - with afghanistan . " he said that no one was more ashamed of the cases of torture at bagdhad 's abu ghraib prison than the american people and asked his audience to be patient with his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john k. bauman talking to students in potsdam .
" watch us , see what happens , " bauman said .
" we 're certain to make some more mistakes .
we 're human , but see if the system of government we have ca n't correct itself . " " normal people " that did n't do the trick for nicole greissel , an 18-year-old junior , who made no secret about the fact that she did n't really like the us . " americans are pretty arrogant and think they 're the best and can do everything they want , " she told dw-world .
" they think they immediately have to get involved if there 's a problem somewhere in the world . " while equally critical of us policy , 19-year-old josef weirauch said he had nothing against americans in general . " they are normal people who try to survive each day , " the senior said .
" it 's actually the same as in germany .
except the oil prices are cheaper and the taxes are not so high and everything looks kind of broken .
but that depends on where you 're living in america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morning sky is set ablaze by the rising sun behind wood island lighthouse off biddeford pool , maine .
weirauch has lived in america : he spent a year at a high school in a portland , maine , suburb , where people did n't have to lock their houses , he said . he 's planning to go back as soon as possible to study and work there - " and to see more about the american way of life , which in my experience is the best thing that i have experienced in my life until now .

" it does n't make any sense to export arms to a country where currently everything is in disarray , " beer told the daily berliner zeitung . she also pointed out that iraq was still in a state of war and cast doubt on whether the armored personnel carriers would be used by iraqi security officials only for self-defense .
" how can you check whether the carriers wo n't be belatedly armed and used in fights against the insurgents ? "
beer asked . criticism is growing of germany 's decision , particularly in light of the fact that berlin was a staunch opponent of the us-led iraq war and chancellor schröder has vowed not to send any soldiers to iraq .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments on the issue . germany not adhering to principles germany has principles , but it does n't seem to be sticking to them .
german weapons are n't allowed to be exported outside nato to volatile regions , which suppress human rights and where civil war-like conditions prevail . that is a good tenet stemming from the time when the federal republic of germany was " noble and good " and did n't want to have anything more to do with the conflicts of the world .
violations of this tenet were pursued such as in the cases of libya and saddam hussein . and now germany wants to deliver fuchs armored personnel carriers to iraq despite the fact that the country fulfills all the criteria that would amount to a breach of the maxim . german arms suppliers , who have sidestepped german law and exported strategically important goods to such countries , have been charged and sentenced . naturally , there have also been official deliveries of weapons to states like saudi arabia , which certainly qualify as volatile regions .
but here germany hid behind excuses such as cooperation with other european partners . in other cases , the circumstances surrounding the transaction were considered more scandalous because it seemed that bribes and corruption was involved . israel the only exception the only exception so far has always been israel .
against the background of german-jewish history and the holocaust , germany has always supplied weapons to israel .
despite the fact that israel is a " crisis region . "
the weapon deliveries go as far as german submarines outfitted with atomic rockets .
germany has almost never turned down israeli arms requests and has always argued that they were meant to provide security for a state threatened with destruction . it 's only in the run-up to the iraq war that german policy regarding the export of arms has begun to change .
last year israel ordered fuchs armored personnel carriers and german defense minister peter struck hastily said " yes " .
he said he thought jerusalem had asked for the enhanced fuchs model outfitted to counter nuclear , biological and chemical attack because it would have to reckon with attacks by weapons of mass destruction from baghdad during the iraq war . but it soon turned out that israel wanted to have the standard fuchs armored personnel carriers - something that it could naturally use against the palestinians .
berlin then backed down and said it could n't help . a slipping of the ban ? and now germany wants to deliver the same fuchs armored carriers to iraq .
the reason ?
berlin says it 's ready to train iraqi security troops in neighboring abu dhabi and that 's why it also wants to grant the trainees the protection of german fuchs tanks . naturally , one can explain , elaborate and sweet-talk everything - the delivery of submarines to israel as well as the refusal to supply armored personnel carriers to the same country .
as well as the offer of the very same vehicle to iraq . there 's no doubt that the world has changed and germany no longer has to fulfill its duties as a country on the border of the cold war sectors .
and naturally , one can expect that the opposition would want to surge ahead much faster with weapons exports than the government does . but , against such a background , the last remnants of the once well-intentioned german abstinence in weapons exports now threaten to slip away . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday .

the decision comes a day after a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz injured five . a large majority of social democrat , green and opposition conservative christian democratic parliaments voted in favor of extending the german armed forces mandate in afghanistan for another year . the extension ensures that a maximum number of 2,250 german troops can continue their role in the multi-national isaf nato-led peacekeeping force in kabul and its surroundings as well as their work in two provincial reconstruction teams in kunduz and faizabad in northern afghanistan . the current mandate of the german troops expires on oct.13. " no guarantee against attacks " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers carry a coffin of a colleague who was killed along with three other german soldiers in a bomb attack in kabul on june 7 , 2003 .
thursday 's decision comes on the heels of another surge in violence in afghanistan . on wednesday , a grenade attack on a german camp in kunduz in northeastern afghanistan injured five soldiers , three of them german .
though the soldiers are now said to be out of danger , the incident underlined the continuing danger and security threat in the volatile country . earlier german defense minister peter struck said he saw no connection between wednesday ’ s rocket attack and the prolongation of the bundeswehr mandate .
struck said the attack was a sign that the extension of the mandate " should n't be seen as simply routine . " " there is no one hundred percent guarantee against attacks of this kind , " struck said , adding that german soldiers in afghanistan were n't questioning their commitment there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck , left , with bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan struck also said that attacks had been expected in the run-up to the october 9th presidential election in afghanistan . “ our teams in northern afghanistan will be reinforced early next year by 80 troops from the czech republic and denmark , " he said .
" we ’ re convinced that our efforts to stabilize peace and security in the region will not be in vain . " the german government has been supported by the cdu in its commitment in afghanistan . " you ca n't withdraw soldiers just because it really is getting dangerous , " christian schmidt , the cdu 's parliamentary spokesman on defense affairs , said on thursday .
at the same time the party has emphasized that the contingents in northern afghanistan had to be beefed up to be made more secure . fdp : half-hearted mission but like in the past , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- remained opposed to an extended mandate . fdp parliamentarians said the work of the provincial reconstruction teams there could not be called a success story , as their mission did not include the fight against drug cultivation and trafficking .
fdp defense spokesman werner hoyer also criticized that the original concept of building up a network of provisional reconstruction teams across the country had not materialized in any way , as other nato members had not provided enough resources to join the campaign . “ a closely-knit network of prts across afghanistan would be required to extend the central government ’ s influence to the provinces which are mostly under the control of warlords , " hoyer said .
" but apart from a few exceptions in the north , nothing has happened on this front so far .
and i can ’ t see much progress being made in the months to come despite the desperate campaigning by the nato secretary-general in recent weeks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai signs on his election registration card in kabul in january , 2004 the fdp believes that it would have been a better idea to separate the uncontroversial mandate for kabul from the one for northern afghanistan .
there is cross-party agreement , though , that a withdrawal of troops in general would have sent a devastating political signal to the karzai government . schröder might drop afghanistan visit however , wednesday ’ s rocket attack may have changed chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s original decision to visit kabul on oct .
11 as part of his planned tour of asia next week . a spokesman for the chancellery said on thursday that the security situation on the ground would be followed closely .
a final decision on whether schröder would include kabul in his itinerary would only be taken at a date close to his departure for asia , he added . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

ngos have vowed to fight a german proposal for the eu to set up refugee asylum camps in northern africa . eu justice and interior ministers on thursday look set to throw their weight behind german interior minister otto schily 's concept of asylum centers in libya , tunisia and more northern african countries .
but non-governmental organizations such as amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- and germany 's pro-asyl are up in arms over the idea , which they view as a fierce attack on international asylum laws . ai and other ngos would fight tooth and nail the setting up of such camps , if only on the grounds that refugees would have no guarantee that their asylum applications will be looked into in a thorough manner , ai germany 's julia duchrow told reporters in berlin on wednesday " we think that those camps will not guarantee that refugees are protected , " duchrow said .
" we think that it is not possible to guarantee that someone can appeal against the decision by eu officials who are deciding who is in need of protection and who is not . " thirty to 60 percent of all people with refugee status in the european union were only recognized as such after appealed initial decisions that said they were not refugees , ai said in a press release . amnesty also warned that plans to harmonize eu asylum practices - which would allow countries to deport asylum seekers to third countries outside the bloc - are going the wrong way .
refugees could thus be sent to countries where human rights and the protection of refugees are n't guaranteed .
" deportation to ukraine or the russian federation , for example , would be a blatant violation of international refugee law , " ai 's wolfgang grenz said . " europe dodges responsibility " duchrow said that asylum camps in northern africa would be used an instrument for europe to dodge its responsibility to deal with refugee crises .
she refused to accept the argument that the very existence of such camps would prevent any refugees from trying to make it to europe on their own or with the help of traffickers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- has defended his conviction that refugee detention camps need to be set up in northern africa to prevent thousands of more people from risking their lives while trying to reach the european mainland in dangerously rickety vessels .
on wednesday , he reiterated his stance while talking to a parliamentary panel of interior affairs experts in berlin .
schily has already received the backing of the italian government which has had to grapple with tens of thousands of african refugees in recent years . despite fierce resistance from the german green party , schily ’ s proposal has found acceptance among other politicians .
social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspuetz said it should first and foremost be seen as a humanitarian offer .
he dismissed as groundless objections that such camps would undermine the very essence of the geneva convention on refugees . camps no matter what during a recent trip to tripoli , italian interior minister giuseppe pisano said plans to set up asylum camps in libya would go ahead no matter what .
italy also signed an agreement with libya on the training of local police to crack down on illegal immigrants . amnesty ’ s julia duchrow expressed shock at the fact that libya was being seen by eu officials as a suitable location for asylum centers . " we have great , great problems with the human rights situation in libya , and we know of many people , from eritrea for example , who have been detained in libya , " duchrow said .
" they have been sent back then to eritrea and are now in military camps .
we fear that they are tortured and we ca n't get access to them . " closer cooperation between libya and the eu comes in the wake of the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on that african country in 1986 .

ngos have vowed to fight a german proposal for the eu to set up refugee asylum camps in northern africa . eu justice and interior ministers on thursday look set to throw their weight behind german interior minister otto schily 's concept of asylum centers in libya , tunisia and more northern african countries .
but non-governmental organizations such as amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- and germany 's pro-asyl are up in arms over the idea , which they view as a fierce attack on international asylum laws . ai and other ngos would fight tooth and nail the setting up of such camps , if only on the grounds that refugees would have no guarantee that their asylum applications will be looked into in a thorough manner , ai germany 's julia duchrow told reporters in berlin on wednesday " we think that those camps will not guarantee that refugees are protected , " duchrow said .
" we think that it is not possible to guarantee that someone can appeal against the decision by eu officials who are deciding who is in need of protection and who is not . " thirty to 60 percent of all people with refugee status in the european union were only recognized as such after appealed initial decisions that said they were not refugees , ai said in a press release . amnesty also warned that plans to harmonize eu asylum practices - which would allow countries to deport asylum seekers to third countries outside the bloc - are going the wrong way .
refugees could thus be sent to countries where human rights and the protection of refugees are n't guaranteed .
" deportation to ukraine or the russian federation , for example , would be a blatant violation of international refugee law , " ai 's wolfgang grenz said . " europe dodges responsibility " duchrow said that asylum camps in northern africa would be used an instrument for europe to dodge its responsibility to deal with refugee crises .
she refused to accept the argument that the very existence of such camps would prevent any refugees from trying to make it to europe on their own or with the help of traffickers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- has defended his conviction that refugee detention camps need to be set up in northern africa to prevent thousands of more people from risking their lives while trying to reach the european mainland in dangerously rickety vessels .
on wednesday , he reiterated his stance while talking to a parliamentary panel of interior affairs experts in berlin .
schily has already received the backing of the italian government which has had to grapple with tens of thousands of african refugees in recent years . despite fierce resistance from the german green party , schily ’ s proposal has found acceptance among other politicians .
social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspuetz said it should first and foremost be seen as a humanitarian offer .
he dismissed as groundless objections that such camps would undermine the very essence of the geneva convention on refugees . camps no matter what during a recent trip to tripoli , italian interior minister giuseppe pisano said plans to set up asylum camps in libya would go ahead no matter what .
italy also signed an agreement with libya on the training of local police to crack down on illegal immigrants . amnesty ’ s julia duchrow expressed shock at the fact that libya was being seen by eu officials as a suitable location for asylum centers . " we have great , great problems with the human rights situation in libya , and we know of many people , from eritrea for example , who have been detained in libya , " duchrow said .

" thirty to 60 percent of all people with refugee status in the european union were only recognized as such after appealed initial decisions that said they were not refugees , ai said in a press release . amnesty also warned that plans to harmonize eu asylum practices - which would allow countries to deport asylum seekers to third countries outside the bloc - are going the wrong way .
refugees could thus be sent to countries where human rights and the protection of refugees are n't guaranteed .
" deportation to ukraine or the russian federation , for example , would be a blatant violation of international refugee law , " ai 's wolfgang grenz said . " europe dodges responsibility " duchrow said that asylum camps in northern africa would be used an instrument for europe to dodge its responsibility to deal with refugee crises .
she refused to accept the argument that the very existence of such camps would prevent any refugees from trying to make it to europe on their own or with the help of traffickers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- has defended his conviction that refugee detention camps need to be set up in northern africa to prevent thousands of more people from risking their lives while trying to reach the european mainland in dangerously rickety vessels .
on wednesday , he reiterated his stance while talking to a parliamentary panel of interior affairs experts in berlin .
schily has already received the backing of the italian government which has had to grapple with tens of thousands of african refugees in recent years . despite fierce resistance from the german green party , schily ’ s proposal has found acceptance among other politicians .
social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspuetz said it should first and foremost be seen as a humanitarian offer .
he dismissed as groundless objections that such camps would undermine the very essence of the geneva convention on refugees . camps no matter what during a recent trip to tripoli , italian interior minister giuseppe pisano said plans to set up asylum camps in libya would go ahead no matter what .
italy also signed an agreement with libya on the training of local police to crack down on illegal immigrants . amnesty ’ s julia duchrow expressed shock at the fact that libya was being seen by eu officials as a suitable location for asylum centers . " we have great , great problems with the human rights situation in libya , and we know of many people , from eritrea for example , who have been detained in libya , " duchrow said .
" they have been sent back then to eritrea and are now in military camps .
we fear that they are tortured and we ca n't get access to them . " closer cooperation between libya and the eu comes in the wake of the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on that african country in 1986 .
libya is used as a starting point for thousands of immigrants landing on italian shores every year . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks to africa for refugee solution eu justice and interior ministers are expected to discuss plans for an eu asylum center in africa at a meeting this week .

trying to counter anti-american sentiments left over from communist rule , us officials are sending americans to eastern german schools .
experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .

trying to counter anti-american sentiments left over from communist rule , us officials are sending americans to eastern german schools .
experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .
he pointed out that germany remained a " leading country in the war against terrorism " and " really our closest ally in dealing with the part of the world where al qaeda came from - with afghanistan .

experts say current us policy is to blame for bad feelings about the us . " everyone here speaks and understands english ? "
john k. bauman recently asked a group of students at friedrich wilhelm von steuben high school in potsdam . " yes , " was the reply and the minister-counselor for political affairs at the us embassy in berlin began to explain the intricacies of the us political system and the upcoming presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a us revolutionary war hero from germany , the steuben high school would n't look out of place in southern california 's suburbs .
for the past year , embassy officials as well as american students , artists , journalists and business people have been visiting schools in eastern germany as part of a project called amis zum anfassen , or " touchable americans , " as one embassy official put it . " in a nutshell , the purpose of this program is to get away from stereotypes and clichés , " roy s. weatherston , the embassy 's deputy cultural attaché , who oversees the program , told dw-world . the embassy had started organizing similar visits shortly after german reunification in 1990 . banking on efforts by germany 's federal government to expose its new citizens to western values , however , us officials decided instead to focus their attention on post-communist eastern european states instead . obsolete values but over the past decade , embassy officials realized that many eastern germans still held on to old views of the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our yes to the gdr 's socialist constitution , " reads this east german propaganda poster .
" in fact we are talking about a society where certain values continue to be passed on , even though the values might be regarded as obsolete , " weatherston said , adding that he himself was confronted with the remnants of communist propaganda during one school visit . " students have said to me , ' in a country , where poverty reigns , where 90 percent of the population are starving , how can you be pursuing this middle east agenda or the iraq agenda , " ' weatherston said . he added that the statement reminded him of soviet propaganda films about washington 's beggar-ridden streets he had seen on television as a student in moscow .
-lrb- according to official figures , 12.5 percent of the us population lived in poverty in 2003 , compared to 13 percent in germany . -rrb- " it 's a complete fantasy kind of view of the united states as a marxist nightmare - early 19th century capitalism extended to the year 2000 , " he said .
" but this is how these kids still seem to be thinking . " iraq not the trigger to correct such views , embassy officials decided to organize regular visits to eastern german schools .
more than 100 events have taken place since the program 's official start last year .
weatherston emphasized that the timing had nothing to do with cooling relations between germany and the us as a result of the differences over iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers have been stationed in western germany since 1945 .
" the purpose of the program is completely apolitical , " he said , adding that speakers are not required to agree with official us policy .
" the purpose is to expose people simply to the kind of americans that germans in the west have known their entire lives . " some experts agreed that the effects of four decades of anti-american propaganda in east germany can still be felt today . " it continues to have a bit of an effect and can only be countered by information and contact " with foreigners , said matthias reitzle , a developmental psychologist at the university of jena who has studied changing values among german adolescents . us policy to blame ? but reitzle agreed with several others that current resentment of the us had more to do with the policies of president george w. bush 's administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like their countrymen all over germany , people in leipzig demonstrated against the iraq war .
" the present is much more crucial , " sybille reinhardt , a political scientist at the university of halle and self-proclaimed fan of the us , told dw-world .
" if america wants to appear in a positive light , they 've got to change their politics . " back at potsdam 's steuben high school , the discussion between bauman and the students also turned to us foreign policy . the diplomat listened politely to students ' concerns about the us detention camp at guantanamo , where al qaeda suspects are being held .
he pointed out that germany remained a " leading country in the war against terrorism " and " really our closest ally in dealing with the part of the world where al qaeda came from - with afghanistan . " he said that no one was more ashamed of the cases of torture at bagdhad 's abu ghraib prison than the american people and asked his audience to be patient with his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john k. bauman talking to students in potsdam .
" watch us , see what happens , " bauman said .
" we 're certain to make some more mistakes .
we 're human , but see if the system of government we have ca n't correct itself . " " normal people " that did n't do the trick for nicole greissel , an 18-year-old junior , who made no secret about the fact that she did n't really like the us . " americans are pretty arrogant and think they 're the best and can do everything they want , " she told dw-world .
" they think they immediately have to get involved if there 's a problem somewhere in the world . " while equally critical of us policy , 19-year-old josef weirauch said he had nothing against americans in general . " they are normal people who try to survive each day , " the senior said .
" it 's actually the same as in germany .
except the oil prices are cheaper and the taxes are not so high and everything looks kind of broken .
but that depends on where you 're living in america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morning sky is set ablaze by the rising sun behind wood island lighthouse off biddeford pool , maine .
weirauch has lived in america : he spent a year at a high school in a portland , maine , suburb , where people did n't have to lock their houses , he said . he 's planning to go back as soon as possible to study and work there - " and to see more about the american way of life , which in my experience is the best thing that i have experienced in my life until now .

osce monitors will observe voting in the us for the first time in november . while the report released by the osce this week praised the united states for its “ vibrant civil society , ” it said weaknesses in the voting system that were revealed in florida and other states during the 2000 presidential elections have shaken voter confidence . us president george w. bush won that election amid widespread criticism that voting was marred in several states .
in florida , voters said that selecting candidates with punch-cards was confusing and led them to choose candidates they did not mean to vote for . a team of five election experts who visited the united states in early september drafted the assessment and outlined potential problems after examining preparations for the plebiscite and talking with us election authorities , political parties , and organizations concerned about democratic processes .

osce monitors will observe voting in the us for the first time in november . while the report released by the osce this week praised the united states for its “ vibrant civil society , ” it said weaknesses in the voting system that were revealed in florida and other states during the 2000 presidential elections have shaken voter confidence . us president george w. bush won that election amid widespread criticism that voting was marred in several states .
in florida , voters said that selecting candidates with punch-cards was confusing and led them to choose candidates they did not mean to vote for . a team of five election experts who visited the united states in early september drafted the assessment and outlined potential problems after examining preparations for the plebiscite and talking with us election authorities , political parties , and organizations concerned about democratic processes .

she added , " and if they 're not going to provide troops , the least they could do is provide money , of which they 're not doing either .

she added , " and if they 're not going to provide troops , the least they could do is provide money , of which they 're not doing either .

" we had hundreds of thousands of troops in europe protecting europe .
we succeeded , in large measure , in making europe prosperous .
and europe has simply opted out , with the exception of britain and a few others , from their global responsibilities , " lantos said . deputy secretary of state , richard armitage , lamented the that europe was not more thankful . " notwithstanding all the things that our nation was responsible for , historically , i do n't think gratitude travels . " lantos argued that us allies such as france , germany , belgium and turkey , and friendly countries in the middle east , such as egypt " have failed the moral test " in sustaining the fledgling democracy in afghanistan " in its time of desperate need .

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .
germany has one of the world 's five biggest music markets .
but its industry has suffered a downturn since 1997 , with turnover dropping 40 percent .
only 55 percent of the country 's best-selling artists are german . " it is often said that whoever makes good music will get on the radio , but that is just not true , " said björn akstinat , president of the german music export office during a seminar at popkomm .
and micha rhein of german band in extremo told reporters : " our record was at number three in the charts for weeks but our promoters had to fight to get the song played on the radio - it 's a cheek . " konrad kuhnt , chief editor at berlin-based radio fritz , said his station could only succeed if it chose the best music .
" it is not true that we would n't play the music .
we wish we had the material to present to our listeners when they say they want more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner , former head of germany 's universal music division tim renner from record label motor music and former head of universal germany backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
" i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . " artists protest over 500 artists signed a plea against what they dubbed " scandalous under-representation " of german-speaking artists in a radio format carved out of " the anglo-american mainstream and the usual oldies . "
supporting them was jacques toubon , former french culture minister , brainchild of france 's quota . he told the parliamentary committee that thanks to his law , french music sales have picked up and new french artists are no longer trees falling in the forest that nobody hears .
record industry executives from all around the world warned a quota was n't a cure-all - especially those from non-english speaking countries . the head of a danish record label was quoted as saying the law would make it that much harder for music from denmark - which is n't exactly breaking through the charts right now - to sell in germany . german pop music , unlike french and spanish , has always had trouble selling abroad . if germans do n't buy it , it might never be made .
there 's no spiral effect , where more sales means more money and thus higher quality music .

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .
germany has one of the world 's five biggest music markets .
but its industry has suffered a downturn since 1997 , with turnover dropping 40 percent .
only 55 percent of the country 's best-selling artists are german . " it is often said that whoever makes good music will get on the radio , but that is just not true , " said björn akstinat , president of the german music export office during a seminar at popkomm .

one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists . france has had a law for a decade to keep pop radio in the hands of french musicians ; stations have to play at least 40 percent music by artists in the country .
germany 's now considering the same thing , placing a quota on how much foreign music radio stations can play . it 's one of the great debates at popkomm , the music industry fair in berlin which started wednesday .
the fear is that anglo-american music , which has long drowned out german music on the airwaves , has caused irrevocable damage . music industry officials estimate that only 10 percent of german radio 's play lists is sung in german , falling way short of france , italy and spain 's 50 percent native language ratio .
that 's why a chorus of music industry leaders have gone to the german parliament to sing the praises of a law , like france 's , which would make sure their sound keeps getting pumped around the nation .
however , the government is cautious . cultural minister christina weiss was reluctant to say whether it 's a good idea .
she said it 's important to have a debate about a german music radio quota , and she hopes that the debate will lead the government to a clear agreement with public radio stations . radio responsibility but the public stations , naturally , do n't want to be told what to do .
the head of bavarian public radio , johannes grotzky , reportedly denied it 's the state 's job to support feeble branches of the economy .
germany has one of the world 's five biggest music markets .
but its industry has suffered a downturn since 1997 , with turnover dropping 40 percent .
only 55 percent of the country 's best-selling artists are german . " it is often said that whoever makes good music will get on the radio , but that is just not true , " said björn akstinat , president of the german music export office during a seminar at popkomm .
and micha rhein of german band in extremo told reporters : " our record was at number three in the charts for weeks but our promoters had to fight to get the song played on the radio - it 's a cheek . " konrad kuhnt , chief editor at berlin-based radio fritz , said his station could only succeed if it chose the best music .
" it is not true that we would n't play the music .
we wish we had the material to present to our listeners when they say they want more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner , former head of germany 's universal music division tim renner from record label motor music and former head of universal germany backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
" i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . " artists protest over 500 artists signed a plea against what they dubbed " scandalous under-representation " of german-speaking artists in a radio format carved out of " the anglo-american mainstream and the usual oldies . "
supporting them was jacques toubon , former french culture minister , brainchild of france 's quota . he told the parliamentary committee that thanks to his law , french music sales have picked up and new french artists are no longer trees falling in the forest that nobody hears .
record industry executives from all around the world warned a quota was n't a cure-all - especially those from non-english speaking countries . the head of a danish record label was quoted as saying the law would make it that much harder for music from denmark - which is n't exactly breaking through the charts right now - to sell in germany . german pop music , unlike french and spanish , has always had trouble selling abroad . if germans do n't buy it , it might never be made .
there 's no spiral effect , where more sales means more money and thus higher quality music .
supporters of a quota want to set that spiral in motion dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can berlin save german pop ?

several dioceses admit they 're facing a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions . several dioceses in germany are looking for ways to tighten the belt even further as funds dry up and parishes become too expensive to run .
the archdiocese of berlin , as well as dioceses in hamburg and trier , have all announced drastic cuts .
aachen , one of germany 's bigger dioceses , is now the latest to join the list of churches struggling to make ends meet .
the bishop of aachen , heinrich mussinghoff , said on wednesday that the economic changes for the catholic community in aachen are coming " faster and more thoroughly than ever before in the church 's history in germany . "
" we ca n't continue to offer our full spectrum of programs , and a lot of our facilities and services will have to go , " mussinghoff said .
a third of the diocese 's staff - around 220 jobs - will be cut as part of the savings plans aimed at stopping up a gaping hole in the church 's coffers .
the opening hours of the aachen cathedral - one of the oldest in germany and a major tourist attraction - may also have to be shortened .
mussinghoff 's diocese alone has to save € 60 million -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- a year in structural costs by 2008 .
even with the savings , aachen is facing an initial financing gap of € 58 million .
church tax declining all of germany 's catholic dioceses are feeling the pinch .
not only are more people dropping out of the church , but increased unemployment has also meant that parishes are collecting less of the nation-wide church tax , which is their main source of funding .
the church has little choice but to undergo what it calls a " consolidation process . "
the number of parishes in each diocese will be reduced , and the number of full-time ministerial and administrative jobs decreased by around 20 percent , meaning those remaining in the church 's employment will have to cover larger geographical areas .
another savings option that has n't been ruled out yet is the sale of church buildings .

several dioceses admit they 're facing a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions . several dioceses in germany are looking for ways to tighten the belt even further as funds dry up and parishes become too expensive to run .

the number of parishes in each diocese will be reduced , and the number of full-time ministerial and administrative jobs decreased by around 20 percent , meaning those remaining in the church 's employment will have to cover larger geographical areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.09.2004 bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek hero charisteas -lrb- center -rrb- helped bremen to victory in valencia bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .
bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .
that was underlined by makaay 's first goal . " the modest dutchman insists bayern victories are all that count .
" we are delighted to win and it does not matter who scores the goals , " said makaay .
" i know what i can do and i think people have seen today what bayern are capable of . "
a predatory header near the half-time whistle and a cool penalty on 52 minutes capped a fine treble for makaay who has scored in each of his last six matches . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .
that was underlined by makaay 's first goal . " the modest dutchman insists bayern victories are all that count .
" we are delighted to win and it does not matter who scores the goals , " said makaay .
" i know what i can do and i think people have seen today what bayern are capable of . "

" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .

the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .

bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev . greek international angelos charisteas seems to love playing football on the big stage , with his late strike for werder bremen securing a sensational 2-1 champions league win over ten-man valencia on wednesday . charisteas , 24 , had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes after replacing christian schulz , but the marksman latched onto ivan klsanic 's pass to slot home in the 84th minute and hand the german champions a vital three points . " fourth choice charisteas scores the winner against valencia , " headlined german daily bild .
" he started on the bench but then helped bremen to a famous champions league win . "
" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .
" we can build on this now . " schaaf certainly has a selection headache ahead in attack with klose scoring four goals in his last two matches while valdez , charisteas and klasnic are all showing strong early season form . rampant makaay awaits werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phantom strikes again .
bremen face bayern munich , 4-0 conquerors of ajax in their midweek champions league encounter , in the bundesliga on saturday and will have to find a way of chaining bayern munich marksman roy makaay down after his master class display on tuesday night . makaay must be struggling to keep his feet on the ground after his hat-trick in bayern 's 4-0 champions league victory saw the plaudits reign in .
the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .

" schaaf 's supersub charisteas has the final say , " exclaimed kicker magazine . german international miroslav klose struck on the hour mark to cancel out valencia 's second minute opener through spanish international vicente before charisteas reminded the football public of his goal scoring talents . it has been a mixed time for charisteas , who scored the winning goal for greece in their 1-0 euro 2004 final victory over portugal , but still can not force his way into the bremen starting line-up .
bremen paid € 3 million , a club record at the time , to lure charisteas to the weserstadion from aris saloniki in june 2002 , but after a promising start he dropped down the pecking order and scored just four goals last season . after greece 's shock euro 2004 win charisteas may have thought he would have more first team action at werder but klose , croat klasnic and paraguayan international nelson valdez are all preferred by manager thomas schaaf .
the greek icon refused to discuss his lack of first team action after the match preferring to concentrate on a result that gives bremen a good chance of reaching the knockout stage of europe 's premier competition . " we are delighted to win our first match in the champions league , " said charisteas .
" we showed our quality in the second half and played some really attacking football . " that statement was backed up by bremen chief schaaf who was delighted to take the scalp of two-time champions league runners-up valencia .
" valencia are a very good team and to beat them is some achievement , " beamed schaaf .

the dutch international has now scored 10 champions league goals for bayern in as many matches and an incredible 40 goals in 53 competitive matches . " roy was sensational , " said manager felix magath .
" the way he took owen hargreaves ' pass and finished for the first goal was worth the entrance fee alone . "
makaay latched onto a 28th minute through ball from hargreaves showing instant control before unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 meters out . " roy is so calm under pressure , " added general manager uli hoeness .
" the first goal was the perfect example .
i told felix magath that anyone else would have taken a few steps first before volleying the ball . " bayern captain oliver kahn likened makaay to west germany 1974 world cup icon gerd muller , scorer of 68 goals in 62 internationals , and munich president franz beckenbauer admitted there were some comparisons between the two .
" makaay has that instinctive nature in the penalty area like gerd muller , " said muller 's former team-mate beckenbauer . " i do not think you could say they were exactly the same as muller scored most of his goals in the area , while roy scores from different areas of the pitch .

how bayer leverkusen must be wishing for a savior like makaay right now .
leverkusen crashed to a 4-2 defeat in a thrilling champions ' league group b encounter on tuesday against dynamo kiev , a marked difference from the 3-0 winning performance in the previous game against real madrid -lrb- photo -rrb- . brazilian striker rincon and romanian midfielder florin cernat both scored doubles for the hosts , while ukrainian international forward andrei voronin and jens nowotny were on target for bayer .
voronin was to end up as the bad boy after he was sent off 11 minutes from time for a second bookable offence as bayer fell flat after their opening 3-0 victory over real madrid . the opponents went at each other at kiev 's 83,000-seater olympic stadium right from the kick-off trying to expose their rival 's defensive frailties .
however , both teams ' defenses stifled the attacking efforts to such an extent that they were limited to trying their luck from long range . thirty minutes into the match the hosts went 1-0 up as rincon fooled paul freier at the left edge of the box , dribbled in and sent the ball into the net with a sharp-angled shot .
three minutes later bernd schneider missed a chance to pull the scores level with a well-struck 22-metre free-kick which hit the woodwork . but after a quarter-hour following the break the visitors equalized through second-half substitute voronin , who shot home on the rebound after dynamo ' keeper alexander shovkovsky deflected robson ponte 's powerful shot from the edge of the box .
bayer rushed ahead and eight minutes later voronin released nowotny into the box and the germans skipper outfoxed shovkovsky and shot into the empty net . but rincon replied immediately with his second of the match from close range after his compatriot kleber fed him in bayer 's box .
dynamo , spurred by a capacity home crowd , poured into attack and late substitute cernat fired dynamo 's third from 11 meters past the outstretched hands of bayer goalkeeper hans-jorg butt . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

how bayer leverkusen must be wishing for a savior like makaay right now .
leverkusen crashed to a 4-2 defeat in a thrilling champions ' league group b encounter on tuesday against dynamo kiev , a marked difference from the 3-0 winning performance in the previous game against real madrid -lrb- photo -rrb- . brazilian striker rincon and romanian midfielder florin cernat both scored doubles for the hosts , while ukrainian international forward andrei voronin and jens nowotny were on target for bayer .
voronin was to end up as the bad boy after he was sent off 11 minutes from time for a second bookable offence as bayer fell flat after their opening 3-0 victory over real madrid . the opponents went at each other at kiev 's 83,000-seater olympic stadium right from the kick-off trying to expose their rival 's defensive frailties .
however , both teams ' defenses stifled the attacking efforts to such an extent that they were limited to trying their luck from long range . thirty minutes into the match the hosts went 1-0 up as rincon fooled paul freier at the left edge of the box , dribbled in and sent the ball into the net with a sharp-angled shot .
three minutes later bernd schneider missed a chance to pull the scores level with a well-struck 22-metre free-kick which hit the woodwork . but after a quarter-hour following the break the visitors equalized through second-half substitute voronin , who shot home on the rebound after dynamo ' keeper alexander shovkovsky deflected robson ponte 's powerful shot from the edge of the box .
bayer rushed ahead and eight minutes later voronin released nowotny into the box and the germans skipper outfoxed shovkovsky and shot into the empty net . but rincon replied immediately with his second of the match from close range after his compatriot kleber fed him in bayer 's box .
dynamo , spurred by a capacity home crowd , poured into attack and late substitute cernat fired dynamo 's third from 11 meters past the outstretched hands of bayer goalkeeper hans-jorg butt . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

leverkusen crashed to a 4-2 defeat in a thrilling champions ' league group b encounter on tuesday against dynamo kiev , a marked difference from the 3-0 winning performance in the previous game against real madrid -lrb- photo -rrb- . brazilian striker rincon and romanian midfielder florin cernat both scored doubles for the hosts , while ukrainian international forward andrei voronin and jens nowotny were on target for bayer .
voronin was to end up as the bad boy after he was sent off 11 minutes from time for a second bookable offence as bayer fell flat after their opening 3-0 victory over real madrid . the opponents went at each other at kiev 's 83,000-seater olympic stadium right from the kick-off trying to expose their rival 's defensive frailties .
however , both teams ' defenses stifled the attacking efforts to such an extent that they were limited to trying their luck from long range . thirty minutes into the match the hosts went 1-0 up as rincon fooled paul freier at the left edge of the box , dribbled in and sent the ball into the net with a sharp-angled shot .
three minutes later bernd schneider missed a chance to pull the scores level with a well-struck 22-metre free-kick which hit the woodwork . but after a quarter-hour following the break the visitors equalized through second-half substitute voronin , who shot home on the rebound after dynamo ' keeper alexander shovkovsky deflected robson ponte 's powerful shot from the edge of the box .
bayer rushed ahead and eight minutes later voronin released nowotny into the box and the germans skipper outfoxed shovkovsky and shot into the empty net . but rincon replied immediately with his second of the match from close range after his compatriot kleber fed him in bayer 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.09.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc eichel : german 2004 deficit at € 43.7 billion the german federal government will run up a record budget deficit of € 43.7 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion dollars -rrb- this year , finance minister hans eichel said on thursday .
the cabinet would rubber stamp the higher-than-anticipated deficit in a supplementary budget next wednesday , eichel told the german lower parliamentary house , the bundestag .
at € 43.7 billion , the budget deficit is about 50 percent wider than originally planned .
eichel blamed the development on lower sales and income tax revenues , as well as falling petrol and tobacco tax revenues .
" the economy is growing , but tax revenues are still declining , " eichel said .
in addition , high unemployment was also weighing on the federal budget .
the minister said the sum could be revised again following the completion of the tax estimates in november .
the previous deficit record was set in 1996 when theo waigel , finance minister under then-chancellor helmut kohl , ran up a deficit of about 80 billion deutsche marks , equivalent to around € 40 billion .

the cabinet would rubber stamp the higher-than-anticipated deficit in a supplementary budget next wednesday , eichel told the german lower parliamentary house , the bundestag .
at € 43.7 billion , the budget deficit is about 50 percent wider than originally planned .
eichel blamed the development on lower sales and income tax revenues , as well as falling petrol and tobacco tax revenues .
" the economy is growing , but tax revenues are still declining , " eichel said .
in addition , high unemployment was also weighing on the federal budget .
the minister said the sum could be revised again following the completion of the tax estimates in november .
the previous deficit record was set in 1996 when theo waigel , finance minister under then-chancellor helmut kohl , ran up a deficit of about 80 billion deutsche marks , equivalent to around € 40 billion .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de eichel unveils draft budget for 2005 german finance minister eichel has put the finishing touches to the draft budget for 2005 .
it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers .

" in view of the current situation , we would clearly forego five or 10 percent of pay , " achenbach told the mass-circulation daily bild .
" one has to be able to look employees in the eye , " achenbach added .
earlier this week , karstadtquelle unveiled plans to sell nearly half of its stores , sell-off non-core activities , and seek an injection of fresh capital from shareholders in a bid to overcome a financial crisis sparked by chronically weak consumer demand in germany and the group 's own misfired diversification strategy .
the giant services sector labor union verdi estimates that more than 20,000 employees from a total workforce of nearly 100,000 could be affected by the drastic cost-cutting plans , either via straightforward job cuts or by the spin-off or sale of activities .

the two tirana-based diplomats , who were not named , are believed to have issued , in exchange for money , an undisclosed number of german visas allowing travel through all 15 of the west european countries covered by the schengen agreement , a spokesman said .
a foreign ministry spokesman said a special inspection team had been sent to tirana when the affair came to light and that " personnel , organisational and legal measures " had been taken .
the die welt newspaper said , in an advance extract of its thursday edition , that action had been taken against a number of staff at the german embassy and that several local security personnel had been dismissed .
it said the foreign ministry had stepped up inspections at its embassies worldwide in the light of the findings .
der spiegel magazine said about 60 or 70 irregular schengen visas had been discovered .

despite tougher laws , users who download illegally still have little to fear . it 's still the big topic at the world 's largest music fair , hosted this year in berlin .
just as in years past , the industry is tormented by falling sales figures - and blaming those swashbuckling internet pirates . they still prefer to steal music from the internet , rather than buy it .

" it does n't make any sense to export arms to a country where currently everything is in disarray , " beer told the daily berliner zeitung . she also pointed out that iraq was still in a state of war and cast doubt on whether the armored personnel carriers would be used by iraqi security officials only for self-defense .
" how can you check whether the carriers wo n't be belatedly armed and used in fights against the insurgents ? "
beer asked . criticism is growing of germany 's decision , particularly in light of the fact that berlin was a staunch opponent of the us-led iraq war and chancellor schröder has vowed not to send any soldiers to iraq .

german weapons are n't allowed to be exported outside nato to volatile regions , which suppress human rights and where civil war-like conditions prevail . that is a good tenet stemming from the time when the federal republic of germany was " noble and good " and did n't want to have anything more to do with the conflicts of the world .
violations of this tenet were pursued such as in the cases of libya and saddam hussein . and now germany wants to deliver fuchs armored personnel carriers to iraq despite the fact that the country fulfills all the criteria that would amount to a breach of the maxim . german arms suppliers , who have sidestepped german law and exported strategically important goods to such countries , have been charged and sentenced . naturally , there have also been official deliveries of weapons to states like saudi arabia , which certainly qualify as volatile regions .
but here germany hid behind excuses such as cooperation with other european partners . in other cases , the circumstances surrounding the transaction were considered more scandalous because it seemed that bribes and corruption was involved . israel the only exception the only exception so far has always been israel .
against the background of german-jewish history and the holocaust , germany has always supplied weapons to israel .
despite the fact that israel is a " crisis region . "
the weapon deliveries go as far as german submarines outfitted with atomic rockets .
germany has almost never turned down israeli arms requests and has always argued that they were meant to provide security for a state threatened with destruction . it 's only in the run-up to the iraq war that german policy regarding the export of arms has begun to change .
last year israel ordered fuchs armored personnel carriers and german defense minister peter struck hastily said " yes " .
he said he thought jerusalem had asked for the enhanced fuchs model outfitted to counter nuclear , biological and chemical attack because it would have to reckon with attacks by weapons of mass destruction from baghdad during the iraq war . but it soon turned out that israel wanted to have the standard fuchs armored personnel carriers - something that it could naturally use against the palestinians .
berlin then backed down and said it could n't help . a slipping of the ban ? and now germany wants to deliver the same fuchs armored carriers to iraq .
the reason ?
berlin says it 's ready to train iraqi security troops in neighboring abu dhabi and that 's why it also wants to grant the trainees the protection of german fuchs tanks . naturally , one can explain , elaborate and sweet-talk everything - the delivery of submarines to israel as well as the refusal to supply armored personnel carriers to the same country .
as well as the offer of the very same vehicle to iraq . there 's no doubt that the world has changed and germany no longer has to fulfill its duties as a country on the border of the cold war sectors .
and naturally , one can expect that the opposition would want to surge ahead much faster with weapons exports than the government does . but , against such a background , the last remnants of the once well-intentioned german abstinence in weapons exports now threaten to slip away . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday .

several dioceses admit they 're facing a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions . several dioceses in germany are looking for ways to tighten the belt even further as funds dry up and parishes become too expensive to run .
the archdiocese of berlin , as well as dioceses in hamburg and trier , have all announced drastic cuts .
aachen , one of germany 's bigger dioceses , is now the latest to join the list of churches struggling to make ends meet .
the bishop of aachen , heinrich mussinghoff , said on wednesday that the economic changes for the catholic community in aachen are coming " faster and more thoroughly than ever before in the church 's history in germany . "
" we ca n't continue to offer our full spectrum of programs , and a lot of our facilities and services will have to go , " mussinghoff said .
a third of the diocese 's staff - around 220 jobs - will be cut as part of the savings plans aimed at stopping up a gaping hole in the church 's coffers .
the opening hours of the aachen cathedral - one of the oldest in germany and a major tourist attraction - may also have to be shortened .
mussinghoff 's diocese alone has to save € 60 million -lrb- $ 74 million -rrb- a year in structural costs by 2008 .
even with the savings , aachen is facing an initial financing gap of € 58 million .
church tax declining all of germany 's catholic dioceses are feeling the pinch .
not only are more people dropping out of the church , but increased unemployment has also meant that parishes are collecting less of the nation-wide church tax , which is their main source of funding .
the church has little choice but to undergo what it calls a " consolidation process . "
the number of parishes in each diocese will be reduced , and the number of full-time ministerial and administrative jobs decreased by around 20 percent , meaning those remaining in the church 's employment will have to cover larger geographical areas .
another savings option that has n't been ruled out yet is the sale of church buildings .
should germany follow in the footsteps of countries such as britain , it 's likely that some churches could undergo a radical conversion .
all across britain , derelict churches are being bought up by corporate chains and turned into superpubs with space for hundreds of drinkers . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

2 of 10 the pieces are picked from among 4,000 entries in 62 wide-ranging categories .
they include painting , sculpture , pottery , furniture , speech , video , poetry and prose .
3 of 10 the koestler award trust works through a whole range of creative arts to try to encourage prisoners ' self-esteem and self-respect .
4 of 10 it was set up by arthur koestler -lrb- 1905-1983 -rrb- , a former war and immigration detainee .
he campaigned to give inmates creative opportunities to combat what he felt were prison life 's dehumanising effects .
5 of 10 the trust aims to address many prisoners ' literacy and numeracy problems so they can go on to further education , training and , eventually , employment on their release .
6 of 10 holiday destinations , ships , planes and travel often feature .
portraiture is also popular .
7 of 10 some pieces are intricate calligraphy work , others are painstaking matchstick constructions .
the hours of the sentence spent on their construction are recorded alongside .
8 of 10 the prison environment , freedom and absent loved ones are common themes .
the prison , not the prisoner , is named in the exhibition .
9 of 10 " you can tell people have just done what 's in their heart .
what strikes me is the commonality - we are each in our own prison .
i feel moved by it , " says visitor kathryn carr , from darlington .
10 of 10 the koestler exhibition 2004 is on at st mary abbots hall , vicarage gate , kensington church street , london w8 , 10am-7pm , until thursday october 7 .

other measures to save energy include a shorter working week , reduced street lighting and scheduled power cuts .
the power shortages have caused a range of problems - affecting the flow of drinking water in homes and causing fridges and freezers to stop working .
president castro said the trouble was caused by problems at cuba 's main power station , not the high price of oil .
" an electrical system that has all these problems is a weak system , " mr castro said .
the president promised to invest in new generating capacity , but warned the problems could continue for five months or more .
" the co-operation of the public is very important , " he said .
western diplomats say cuba is finding it difficult to make the investment its power system needs , because of a us trade embargo .
to help cope with the crisis , 118 factories , including steel plants , sugar mills and paper processors will be shut for the whole of october , said vice-president carlos lage .
the average eight-hour government work day will be cut by 30 minutes and school classes will start half-an-hour later .

steve christian was the first of seven men to appear in a trial which has highlighted claims of underage sex .
one witness reportedly wept as she told the trial , via video link from new zealand , that as a young girl she was raped by mr christian four times .
the group , which makes up half the island 's adult male population , faces 55 charges of rape or indecent assault .
new zealand prosecutors say there is an ingrained culture of having sex with underage children on pitcairn , famous for its link to the mutiny on the bounty in 1789 .
local women have argued the practice is an island tradition and consensual , saying some of the alleged victims of abuse had been coerced into testifying .
the alleged victims are all now off the island and will testify by video link from new zealand .
challenging britain 's authority on wednesday public prosecutor simon moore said mr christian , 53 , committed the crimes between the ages of 13 and 24 .
" there was no question of consent .
steve christian was exercising a right he believed was his , " media reports quoted mr moore as saying .
the first prosecution witness described how as an 11 or 12-year-old girl she was taunted on the island for being a " half-caste " and that she had been targeted and raped by steve christian on four occasions .
she said she was held down by the defendant and two other men in the first attack .
there was no one she or her parents could turn to on the island , she reportedly said .
mr christian pleaded not guilty to six charges of rape and four of indecent assault of four women , the afp news agency quoted local media reports .
a radio new zealand reporter - one of only six journalists allowed on the island - said the trial opened in a community hall in adamstown , the island 's solitary settlement .
among the accused are len brown , his son dave , jay warren , terry young and dennis christian .
the mayor 's son , 30-year-old randy , is also facing charges .
the defendants are expected to mount a defence based on a challenge to britain 's authority over the island .
they argue that although pitcairn - as a british overseas territory - is theoretically subject to english law , consensual underage sex , involving girls aged 12 or 13 , is a traditional part of island life .
some observers have insisted that any convictions could threaten the island 's future by restricting its ability to support itself .
pitcairn has a resident population of 47 , and the islanders make a living by selling handicrafts to passing boats along with fishing and subsistence farming .
' unfair ' the charges stem from 1999 when an islander told a visiting british policewoman she had been sexually abused .
since then , new laws including a child protection act have been enacted and police and social workers have been sent to the island .
many of the women of pitcairn believe that the charges against the seven are unfair .
the wives , daughters , sisters and mothers of some of the accused have spoken out to declare the men 's innocence .
bounty link judges , lawyers and other court staff have made the long journey from new zealand for the trial .
the islanders are descendents of mutineers who seized control of the british navy vessel hms bounty in 1789 .
they landed on the uninhabited island of pitcairn a year later with a group of polynesian men and women and remained undiscovered for almost 20 years .

the film star and two other men were sued for $ 45m -lrb- £ 27.9m -rrb- by actor and screenwriter roger wilson .
he accused mr dicaprio , 29 , of telling friend todd healy to beat him up after a row over a former girlfriend in 1998 .

the legal papers filed against dicaprio and his friends alleged the actor incited " his posse " to attack wilson outside a manhattan restaurant .
dicaprio ' grateful ' but the judge ruled only a restaurant security guard had heard mr dicaprio 's alleged statement , so he could not be said to have aided and abetted mr healey .
she cited mr healey 's sworn testimony that he was never in the restaurant and came upon the group outside , when a row started over phone calls to mr wilson 's then-girlfriend , showgirls actress elizabeth berkley .
the judge said the case could continue against healey , who admitted punching wilson but claims it was in self-defence .
mr wilson alleges he suffered a broken larynx when he was hit in the throat , ending his singing career .
mr dicaprio 's lawyer , paul callan , said the ruling left his client " totally out of the case " .
a statement from the titanic actor 's publicist said he was " grateful that the judicial system has finally resolved this case in a fair and just manner " .
the judge also dropped the cases against mr dicaprio 's friends jay ferguson and kevin connelly .
