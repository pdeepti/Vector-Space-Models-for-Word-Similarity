ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2004 introducing euro helps strengthen polish economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearly focused on the euro : leszek balcerowicz now that poland is a member of the eu , the country is looking ahead to the future .
leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them .
-lrb- jan .
5 , 2004 -rrb- poland says no easy answer on eu constitution the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .

for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's leading economic institutes every year in fall and spring six top economic think tanks publish their forecast for the german economy .
their predictions are taken very seriously by the government and industry .
but who are these experts ?

he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . " winning the presidency in the first round of voting of germany 's federal assembly , köhler garnered 604 votes compared to 589 for his opponent , university president gesine schwan .
in a speech after his election , the ninth postwar president said he wanted to encourage germany to become a country of innovation and ideas . " for me , germany has been too slow on its path to a knowledge society , " said the 61-year-old köhler .
he added he would also support efforts to continue with hard economic and social reforms .
" we have to face reality .
germany will have to fight for its place in the 21st century . " the former managing director of the international monetary fund was nominated for the presidency by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , its bavarian sister party the christian social union and the liberal free democratic party .
his victory over the social democrats ' and greens ' candidate schwan was never really in doubt . opposition majority in assembly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens control the lower house of parliament , the conservatives and liberal have a majority in the bundesversammlung , or federal assembly , which elects germany 's president . the body is a special constitutional body that convenes solely for this purpose .
it is made up of federal parliamentarians , delegates from germany 's 16 states and persons from the country 's sport , cultural and business life . elected for a term of five years , germany 's president has primarily a symbolic function and wields limited powers but does have moral authority .
past presidents have played an important role in national life by opening debates on broad ethical and social issues . köhler has had a distinguished career in international finance , but both in and outside germany , he 's relatively unknown .
in his speech he suggested he wanted to be an inclusive president at a time when the country is struggling economically and socially . " i want to be president of all germans and all those who live here , " he said . köhler will take over from retiring president johannes rau on july 1 . born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .
he assured them that they can be confident about their region 's future .
eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .

german national team coach rudi völler added goal-scoring power and left one position open in announcing the team he will take to the euro 2004 championships in portugal in two weeks . the biggest surprise was the addition of thomas brdaric , a striker who won attention in the last half of the bundesliga season by scoring 12 goals for his club , hanover 96 . " brdaric had an impressive season , especially the last half , " völler said in announcing the team .
he praised brdaric 's speed and said he scored goals " that you do n't see often from german strikers . " brdaric , 29 , who has so far only played in a friendly against the u.s. , took oliver neuville 's place in the national team .
the small striker has scored four goals in 48 games for the national team , but has struggled since performing competently at the 2002 world cup .
he is coming off a difficult season where he mostly warmed the bench for his club , bayer leverkusen . youth injection the 22-member team is largely made up of the same players that made the world cup trip , with the exception of a few young talents that will offer the team 's established veterans serious competition for the starting spots .
andreas hinkel and philipp lahm , defenders from vfb stuttgart , and goalie timo hildebrand are three of the youngsters who will be gaining valuable tournament experience in portugal ahead of the 2006 world cup . " this is a good sign " for germany , said völler . the coach said he will add the final player on june 2 .

german national team coach rudi völler added goal-scoring power and left one position open in announcing the team he will take to the euro 2004 championships in portugal in two weeks . the biggest surprise was the addition of thomas brdaric , a striker who won attention in the last half of the bundesliga season by scoring 12 goals for his club , hanover 96 . " brdaric had an impressive season , especially the last half , " völler said in announcing the team .
he praised brdaric 's speed and said he scored goals " that you do n't see often from german strikers . " brdaric , 29 , who has so far only played in a friendly against the u.s. , took oliver neuville 's place in the national team .
the small striker has scored four goals in 48 games for the national team , but has struggled since performing competently at the 2002 world cup .
he is coming off a difficult season where he mostly warmed the bench for his club , bayer leverkusen . youth injection the 22-member team is largely made up of the same players that made the world cup trip , with the exception of a few young talents that will offer the team 's established veterans serious competition for the starting spots .
andreas hinkel and philipp lahm , defenders from vfb stuttgart , and goalie timo hildebrand are three of the youngsters who will be gaining valuable tournament experience in portugal ahead of the 2006 world cup . " this is a good sign " for germany , said völler . the coach said he will add the final player on june 2 .
hot contenders for the spot will be 18-year-old lukas podolski and sebastian schweinsteiger .
podolski , playing for 1 .
fc cologne , scored 10 goals in the last half of the season and became the youthful sensation of the bundesliga . schweinsteiger , 19 , who already has a few national team games under his belt , has been performing well in midfield for bayern munich and could give völler a creative option in the offense . both will get the chance to prove themselves at the under 21 european championships from may 27 until june 8 in germany . the rest of the team : goal - oliver kahn -lrb- fc bayern munich -rrb- , jens lehmann -lrb- fc arsenal london -rrb- , timo hildebrand -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- ; defense - frank baumann -lrb- werder bremen -rrb- , arne friedrich -lrb- hertha bsc berlin -rrb- , andreas hinkel -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- , philipp lahm -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- , jens nowotny -lrb- bayer leverkusen -rrb- , christian rahn -lrb- hamburger sv -rrb- , christian wörns -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- ; midfield - michael ballack -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , fabian ernst -lrb- werder bremen -rrb- , paul freier -lrb- vfl bochum -rrb- , torsten frings -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- , dietmar hamann -lrb- fc liverpool -rrb- , jens jeremies -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , sebastian kehl -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- , bernd schneider -lrb- bayer leverkusen -rrb- ; strikers - fredi bobic -lrb- hertha bsc berlin -rrb- , thomas brdaric -lrb- hanover 96 -rrb- , kevin kuranyi -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- , miroslav klose -lrb- 1 .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them .
-lrb- jan .
5 , 2004 -rrb- poland says no easy answer on eu constitution the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .

" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's leading economic institutes every year in fall and spring six top economic think tanks publish their forecast for the german economy .
their predictions are taken very seriously by the government and industry .
but who are these experts ?

chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .

" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .

eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2004 introducing euro helps strengthen polish economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearly focused on the euro : leszek balcerowicz now that poland is a member of the eu , the country is looking ahead to the future .
leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them .
-lrb- jan .
5 , 2004 -rrb- poland says no easy answer on eu constitution the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .

however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .

he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . " winning the presidency in the first round of voting of germany 's federal assembly , köhler garnered 604 votes compared to 589 for his opponent , university president gesine schwan .
in a speech after his election , the ninth postwar president said he wanted to encourage germany to become a country of innovation and ideas . " for me , germany has been too slow on its path to a knowledge society , " said the 61-year-old köhler .
he added he would also support efforts to continue with hard economic and social reforms .
" we have to face reality .
germany will have to fight for its place in the 21st century . " the former managing director of the international monetary fund was nominated for the presidency by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , its bavarian sister party the christian social union and the liberal free democratic party .
his victory over the social democrats ' and greens ' candidate schwan was never really in doubt . opposition majority in assembly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens control the lower house of parliament , the conservatives and liberal have a majority in the bundesversammlung , or federal assembly , which elects germany 's president . the body is a special constitutional body that convenes solely for this purpose .
it is made up of federal parliamentarians , delegates from germany 's 16 states and persons from the country 's sport , cultural and business life . elected for a term of five years , germany 's president has primarily a symbolic function and wields limited powers but does have moral authority .
past presidents have played an important role in national life by opening debates on broad ethical and social issues . köhler has had a distinguished career in international finance , but both in and outside germany , he 's relatively unknown .
in his speech he suggested he wanted to be an inclusive president at a time when the country is struggling economically and socially . " i want to be president of all germans and all those who live here , " he said . köhler will take over from retiring president johannes rau on july 1 . born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .
he assured them that they can be confident about their region 's future .
eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .
he assured them that they can be confident about their region 's future .
eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .

" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

german national team coach rudi völler added goal-scoring power and left one position open in announcing the team he will take to the euro 2004 championships in portugal in two weeks . the biggest surprise was the addition of thomas brdaric , a striker who won attention in the last half of the bundesliga season by scoring 12 goals for his club , hanover 96 . " brdaric had an impressive season , especially the last half , " völler said in announcing the team .
he praised brdaric 's speed and said he scored goals " that you do n't see often from german strikers . " brdaric , 29 , who has so far only played in a friendly against the u.s. , took oliver neuville 's place in the national team .
the small striker has scored four goals in 48 games for the national team , but has struggled since performing competently at the 2002 world cup .
he is coming off a difficult season where he mostly warmed the bench for his club , bayer leverkusen . youth injection the 22-member team is largely made up of the same players that made the world cup trip , with the exception of a few young talents that will offer the team 's established veterans serious competition for the starting spots .
andreas hinkel and philipp lahm , defenders from vfb stuttgart , and goalie timo hildebrand are three of the youngsters who will be gaining valuable tournament experience in portugal ahead of the 2006 world cup . " this is a good sign " for germany , said völler . the coach said he will add the final player on june 2 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2004 economists call for higher petrol taxes in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay up : german gas prices are at postwar highs .
in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's leading economic institutes every year in fall and spring six top economic think tanks publish their forecast for the german economy .
their predictions are taken very seriously by the government and industry .
but who are these experts ?

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .

eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .

eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 24.05.2004 köhler elected german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler will be germany 's ninth postwar president horst köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , was elected germany 's new president on sunday .
he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . " winning the presidency in the first round of voting of germany 's federal assembly , köhler garnered 604 votes compared to 589 for his opponent , university president gesine schwan .
in a speech after his election , the ninth postwar president said he wanted to encourage germany to become a country of innovation and ideas . " for me , germany has been too slow on its path to a knowledge society , " said the 61-year-old köhler .
he added he would also support efforts to continue with hard economic and social reforms .
" we have to face reality .
germany will have to fight for its place in the 21st century . " the former managing director of the international monetary fund was nominated for the presidency by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , its bavarian sister party the christian social union and the liberal free democratic party .
his victory over the social democrats ' and greens ' candidate schwan was never really in doubt . opposition majority in assembly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens control the lower house of parliament , the conservatives and liberal have a majority in the bundesversammlung , or federal assembly , which elects germany 's president . the body is a special constitutional body that convenes solely for this purpose .
it is made up of federal parliamentarians , delegates from germany 's 16 states and persons from the country 's sport , cultural and business life . elected for a term of five years , germany 's president has primarily a symbolic function and wields limited powers but does have moral authority .
past presidents have played an important role in national life by opening debates on broad ethical and social issues . köhler has had a distinguished career in international finance , but both in and outside germany , he 's relatively unknown .
in his speech he suggested he wanted to be an inclusive president at a time when the country is struggling economically and socially . " i want to be president of all germans and all those who live here , " he said . köhler will take over from retiring president johannes rau on july 1 . born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de electing germany 's president dw-world 's complete coverage of the presidential election .

but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .

" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .

and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .

eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2004 eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german cities are still in need of development aid , say leaders the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . the heads of germany 's economically depressed eastern states could be forgiven for going on the defensive prior to their meeting in brandenburg with mario monti , the european commissioner for competition . with 10 mainly former communist countries now in the european union , eastern germany 's economic problems suddenly do n't seem so bad .
and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .
he assured them that they can be confident about their region 's future .
eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .
-lrb- april 6 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should eastern germany continue to benefit from eu development aid ?

he said he was counting on the irish eu presidency to put forward a proposal that will be acceptable to all before june 30 , the date ireland hands over the rotating leadership .
after member states failed to agree to voting procedures outlined in the draft constitution at a summit last december and a meeting last week between eu foreign ministers failed to produce a compromise , a final round of talks have been scheduled for mid-june .
schröder said the system of double majority voting contained in the constitution was accepted in principle by everyone , but there was still debate about how it should be implemented .
under the draft proposal , eu laws would need the support of at least 50 percent of member states representing 60 percent of the total population , a distribution that has been criticized by smaller states , notably spain and poland , as favoring the eu 's most populous members germany , france and britain . dw-world.de eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution the european constitution crowned the agenda at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels where they hoped to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december .

the german leader 's comments came just as the united states and britain prepared to introduce a new u.n. resolution on the restoration of iraqi sovereignty , including the caretaker government 's powers and the question of iraq 's oil revenue .
in direct language , schröder urged washington to hand over all power to iraq .

the definition of sovereignty is the most contentious issue in a prospective iraqi resolution and crucial for the bush administration if it hopes to gain the approval of the security council , which includes non-permanent member germany .
schröder , who was adamantly opposed to the iraq war last year , said germany and the united states shared a " common interest to stabilize iraq , " and that a disagreement over whether the war was justified was now only of historic relevance . dw-world.de schröder pushes for muslim peacekeepers in iraq chancellor gerhard schröder discussed a new un resolution on iraq with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .

german national team coach rudi völler added goal-scoring power and left one position open in announcing the team he will take to the euro 2004 championships in portugal in two weeks . the biggest surprise was the addition of thomas brdaric , a striker who won attention in the last half of the bundesliga season by scoring 12 goals for his club , hanover 96 . " brdaric had an impressive season , especially the last half , " völler said in announcing the team .
he praised brdaric 's speed and said he scored goals " that you do n't see often from german strikers . " brdaric , 29 , who has so far only played in a friendly against the u.s. , took oliver neuville 's place in the national team .
the small striker has scored four goals in 48 games for the national team , but has struggled since performing competently at the 2002 world cup .
he is coming off a difficult season where he mostly warmed the bench for his club , bayer leverkusen . youth injection the 22-member team is largely made up of the same players that made the world cup trip , with the exception of a few young talents that will offer the team 's established veterans serious competition for the starting spots .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .

however , that has been flatly rejected by spain and poland as it would mean that europe 's big three - the uk , france and germany - could form a blocking minority on any decisions they did not like .
madrid would like the population threshold raised so that it would be much easier for it – as a medium-sized country – to block a decision it did not want .
it recently suggested the bar be raised to 66 % .
raising the thresholds of both the member states and the population appears to be the way the irish presidency is thinking as well .
its document suggests that " consensus will not be secured without raising the population threshold . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2004 eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german cities are still in need of development aid , say leaders the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . the heads of germany 's economically depressed eastern states could be forgiven for going on the defensive prior to their meeting in brandenburg with mario monti , the european commissioner for competition . with 10 mainly former communist countries now in the european union , eastern germany 's economic problems suddenly do n't seem so bad .
and that means the region is in danger of losing some of the eu 's development aid that , together with the so-called " solidarity payments " from western germany , have funded reconstruction projects in the former east germany . reconstruction far from over during the meeting on monday , brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback .
all the progress that 's been made in recent years is still very fragile , platzeck said . eastern germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the gdr , and rebuilding the region is far from over , he added . there have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in eu subsidies the eastern german states would have to reckon with .
the european commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on jan.1 , 2007 . no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said it was important for him to talk with eastern german leaders about their worries .
he assured them that they can be confident about their region 's future .
eastern germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the eu - a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development , he said . statistically speaking , eastern germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the eu , now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies .
however , unemployment in germany 's eastern states is over 20 percent , and despite an estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 -rrb- in aid , the economic gap separating east and west has n't been closed . platzeck said that parts of the european commission 's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem .
the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , said that without financial help from brussels his state would face a budget emergency . last month , a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east german reconstruction project was a failure .
but platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair .
he said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of brandenburg were working very well . brandenburg 's state government has already divided the region into two zones , so that it can at least apply for the highest level of eu funding for the poorer northern half . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .
-lrb- april 6 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should eastern germany continue to benefit from eu development aid ?

in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes . in the wake of increasing world wide demand for fuel , the institute for world economics -lrb- ifw -rrb- in kiel has called for an increase in germany 's ecology tax on gasoline .
" if -lrb- ecology taxes were raised -rrb- in a concerted effort among many industrial nations , it would lead to greater energy efficiency and would take pressure off the world oil markets , " ifw natural resources expert gernot klepper told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
in the long term , klepper said , such a tax increase could have a positive effect on the economy .
' pull the emergency brake ' at least one newspaper editorialist begged to differ .
" whoever would dream of asking for an increased ecology tax , given the current economic situation in germany , must have completely lost all his economic marbles , " wrote the essen-based neue ruhr zeitung .
for its part , the automobile club of germany has called on the government to lower the ecology tax on petrol .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier said in early may .
but the recent record prices for oil and gas have failed to make much of an impact on germans ' driving habits , according to data from the association of the german petroleum industry -lrb- mwv -rrb- .
for the first four months of the year , gasoline use was down just 2.4 percent from a year earlier , mwv spokesman klaus picard told die welt newspaper .
call for ' harmonization ' however , picard also did not come out in favor of lowering the ecology tax , saying such a move would be " pointless . "
rather , germany should push for a harmonization of gas prices within europe .
germans pay the second-highest gas prices in europe after britain .
this discrepancy leads to what is called " tank tourism , " where drivers cross borders for better gas prices .
for his part , klepper predicted continued strong increases in oil and gas prices .
he said he expects a barrel of oil to eventually surpass $ 50 -lrb- € 42 -rrb- .
currently the per barrel price is around $ 40 .
moreover , the high prices are here for the long term , klepper said , citing growing demand in asia and limited production capacity .
bleak future according to klepper , politicians should n't try to convince consumers that the high prices are only temporary , and that they should be offset by abolishing the ecology tax .
it is " illusory to think that oil , and thus gasoline , are ever going to be really inexpensive again , " the ifw expert said .
a long-term trend toward reduced fuel consumption lies mainly in developing more efficient cars and the increasing use of diesel cars , the mwv 's picard said . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fuel prices hover near record mark two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .

leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2004 introducing euro helps strengthen polish economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearly focused on the euro : leszek balcerowicz now that poland is a member of the eu , the country is looking ahead to the future .
leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible . even though the european union welcomed 10 new members into its fold on may 1 , the mainly former communist countries in eastern europe will not enter the euro zone for some time to come .
before they can adopt the common currency , the new member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
many of the new eu states are already aiming for the first possible entry date .
in poland , the director of the central bank hopes the new currency will help speed up economic growth in his country .
dw-world interviewed leszek balcerowicz about why the euro is so important for poland 's economy .
dw-world : the earliest possible date for introducing the euro into poland is jan .
1 , 2007 .
why have you been such a strong advocate of meeting that date ?
balcerowicz : it 's important for poland to strive to meet the necessary requirements for introducing the common currency as soon as possible .
these requirements are listed in the maastricht treaty .
we meet some of these conditions : poland has a low inflation rate , for example .
but our budget deficit is still too high , just like in germany .
from an economic point of view and for future growth , it would be better to solve this problem rather than ignore it .
we need - regardless of the euro - fiscal reforms with the goal of reducing our state expenditures .
doing so has the double advantage of buffeting economic growth and opening the doors to the euro .
therefore , it makes sense to begin fulfilling the maastricht criteria sooner than later .
dw-world : what are the advantages of a quick adoption of the euro in poland ?
balcerowicz : when people have the same currency , trade improves ; and higher exports mean higher growth rates in a country .
it 's also important for foreign investment to have a common currency .
but that all only functions given certain prerequisites , the most important of which , both germany and france have failed to meet , namely budgetary discipline in the euro zone .
germany and france are not only responsible for themselves , they share responsibility for maintaining the value of the euro .
dw-world : although the economy is growing , unemployment in poland is still about 20 percent .
what needs to take place in order to get people back to work ?
balcerowicz : first , the minimum wage is poland is too high .
that means that the companies in poorer regions of the country are not interested in creating more legal jobs .
instead they try to hire people through other means .
the employment laws are also too rigid in poland .
when i was finance minister between 1997 and 2000 , i tried to open up the labor market and make it more flexible , but unfortunately my reform plans were blocked .
poland also has a specific demographic problem , different from that in germany -lrb- where the working population is aging -rrb- .
in the last two or three years , more and more young people have flooded the labor market , and that 's expected to continue for a few more years .
so you can see , the supply of labor in poland is continuing to grow without enough jobs being created , and for this reason we urgently need to reform our labor market . interview conducted by nina werkhäuser -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east after 10 countries join the eu , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them .
-lrb- jan .
5 , 2004 -rrb- poland says no easy answer on eu constitution the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy .
-lrb- may 12 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think it 's a good idea that the new eu countries introduce the euro as quickly as possible ?

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .
chancellor gerhard schröder is looking for ways to compromise . according to the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , schröder will head into talks with conservative leaders on tuesday willing to compromise in order to achieve a breakthrough on proposed changes to germany 's immigration policies . citing government immigration experts , the magazine reported schröder is willing to make it easier to deport foreigners " professing hatred " such as islamic militants or members of other extremist creeds .
he is also considering toughening up requirements for those foreigners wanting to permanently relocate to germany by making them subject to investigation by domestic intelligence authorities . but opposition politicians remained skeptical ahead of the talks .
" i want to see concrete laws that include what 's being promised , " conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber told german radio on saturday . a day before the talks , cdu domestic affairs expert wolfgang bosbach said germany 's constitution should be tinkered with so that law enforcement can lock up top terrorist suspects . as it stands now , germany can either ship those suspects to their home countries , where they can be threatened with torture or death , or let them " roam free , " said bosbach . " we ca n't take the first option , and we do n't want to do the second , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung .
government officials said they were n't sure schröder would be willing to go that far . germany 's center-left ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has long pushed for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies arguing well-qualified foreigners will be needed in coming decades for business and industry and to help to keep social services from collapsing as germany 's population continues to age . but the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian allies - never keen on letting more foreigners into the country - have stalled the government 's efforts in the upper house of parliament where they have a blocking majority .
and since the terrorist attacks in madrid in march they have made reaching an accord on immigration contingent on appeasing their internal security concerns . greens on board ? the greens , in particular , have been rankled by the pressure from the conservatives , arguing their demands go too far .
that caused them to back out of all-party talks earlier this month , but the social democrats have convinced them to continue to work for a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper german interior minister otto schily was confident the two sides could strike a deal next week .
" i have heard signals from the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- that also sound optimistic .
therefore i expect we 'll find a solution , " he said . besides wanting a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and who preach hate and violence , the conservative opposition also wants to set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives .
for example , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let highly-qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . that could mean if the talks on tuesday fail , the ruling coalition could decide to go it alone and push ahead with legislation that does n't need approval in the upper house .
some measures the spd and greens could begin with include integration courses for foreigners with language instruction and an introduction to german history and law , as well as hiring skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the " green card " regulation in the it sector . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

research for industry regulator ofgem said consumers north of the border were wasting up to £ 72 a year by staying with the former monopoly companies .
its studies also found that people in the north of scotland had the lowest electricity switching rate in the uk .
ofgem urged people to shop around - but the companies defended their prices .
energywatch scotland , the gas and electricity watchdog , also urged consumers to change suppliers .
competitive pricing it said research had suggested that four out of five electricity customers in the north of scotland had remained with scottish hydro electric , the former monopoly supplier .
only one in three had switched from scottishpower in the south of the country .
the watchdog believes the reluctance to swap makes the former monopolies complacent when it comes to competitive pricing .
only by customers saying no to their local suppliers will the former monopolies act to bring down their prices john hanlon energywatch scotland chairman john hanlon said : " both companies charge significantly higher prices to their local loyal customers than they offer new customers in other parts of great britain .
" i do n't know why consumers put up with it when they have the choice to make a simple switch and save a substantial amount of money each year .
" only by customers saying no to their local suppliers will the former monopolies act to bring down their prices . "
his message was echoed by iain osborne , ofgem 's director of consumer markets .
he said : " there are no prizes for loyalty in the energy market .
" we would urge all customers in scottishpower and scottish hydro electric areas , who have never moved from the companies or scottish gas , to shop around for a better deal for their energy . "
ofgem 's comments are surprising given that their recent reports have shown that competition in the south of scotland is as high as the rest of the uk and greater than it is in london scottishpower spokesman ofgem 's research found that people living in areas where scottishpower and scottish hydro electric used to have monopolies were paying an average of £ 41 and £ 29 more than they had to each year respectively .
they were also paying £ 31 more than they had to if they received gas from scottish gas .
but scottishpower said the figures were " misleading " because they only covered one tariff .
" the point has to be made that because customers within scottishpower are switching to another method of payment , such as dual fuel , they can make significant savings , " said a spokesman .
he added : " ofgem 's comments are surprising given that their recent reports have shown that competition in the south of scotland is as high as the rest of the uk and greater than it is in london . "
a spokeswoman for scottish hydro electric said : " we believe the package of goods and services available to our customers represents good value for money and are committed to doing everything we can to maintain our high standards of service for years to come . "
a scottish gas spokesman said : " customers have chosen to stay with us for a whole variety of reasons , not just price , but the service and quality we offer .
" in fact , we see a lot of customers who have left coming back to us . "

" only by customers saying no to their local suppliers will the former monopolies act to bring down their prices . "
his message was echoed by iain osborne , ofgem 's director of consumer markets .
he said : " there are no prizes for loyalty in the energy market .
" we would urge all customers in scottishpower and scottish hydro electric areas , who have never moved from the companies or scottish gas , to shop around for a better deal for their energy . "
" ofgem 's comments are surprising given that their recent reports have shown that competition in the south of scotland is as high as the rest of the uk and greater than it is in london " scottishpower spokesman ofgem 's research found that people living in areas where scottishpower and scottish hydro electric used to have monopolies were paying an average of £ 41 and £ 29 more than they had to each year respectively .
they were also paying £ 31 more than they had to if they received gas from scottish gas .
but scottishpower said the figures were " misleading " because they only covered one tariff .
" the point has to be made that because customers within scottishpower are switching to another method of payment , such as dual fuel , they can make significant savings , " said a spokesman .
he added : " ofgem 's comments are surprising given that their recent reports have shown that competition in the south of scotland is as high as the rest of the uk and greater than it is in london . "
a spokeswoman for scottish hydro electric said : " we believe the package of goods and services available to our customers represents good value for money and are committed to doing everything we can to maintain our high standards of service for years to come . "
a scottish gas spokesman said : " customers have chosen to stay with us for a whole variety of reasons , not just price , but the service and quality we offer .
" in fact , we see a lot of customers who have left coming back to us . "

lula arrived in china on monday for a six-day state visit focusing on trade with the booming asian economic giant .
he is also hoping to strengthen the g20 group of developing nations born at the world trade organization 's cancun conference in september 2003 .
brazil and china are prominent members of the alliance , which aims to wrest the wto agenda from wealthy nations .
lula 's entourage includes eight ministers and more than 300 business people .
steel and soy beans before leaving home , the brazilian president said he viewed the visit to china as an important one for his presidency .
in a televised speech , he said brazil " can not and will not lose this opportunity " as stepping up exports to china 's huge market was " one of the most secure ways to increase our domestic growth " .
following talks with president hu , lula will travel to shanghai , the country 's main commercial centre , where he will attend a world bank-backed conference on poverty reduction .
poverty reduction is one of the declared aims of the g20 bloc , which has since expanded to 22 developing nations .
trade between brazil and china has grown four-fold in just four years from $ 1.54bn -lrb- £ 859m -rrb- in 1999 to $ 6.68bn in 2003 .
most of the growth has come from expansion in brazil 's exports to china , whose fast growing economy is swallowing brazilian iron ore for steel production to fuel its rapid industrialisation , as well as farm goods , especially soy beans .
brazil 's exports to china were worth $ 4.5bn in 2003 , figures from the south american country 's ministry of development and foreign trade show .
soy beans made up roughly 30 % of exports , and iron ore more than 10 % .
important partner brazil 's economy shrank in 2003 , so its left-wing , populist president is keen to find fresh sources of growth .
china is also benefiting from trade growth through construction contracts for a multi-billion dollar revamp of brazil 's clogged ports and railways , and china 's baosteel group is building a $ 1.5bn steel mill in brazil 's maranhao province .
a new railway linking brazil to the pacific to speed up shipping times to asia is also under discussion .
some brazilian firms - notably plane-maker embraer and bus firm marcopolo - either have factories in china or are considering opening them .
labour costs there are one-third of brazilian rates , marcopolo chief executive jose rubens de la rosa told the financial times .
during his visit , lula will formally open the beijing offices of brazilian oil firm petrobas .
diversification brazil 's trade minister luis fernando furlan has said , " we do n't just want to sell basic goods to china . "
instead , he sees a market among china 's middle-class consumers for more sophisticated finished items .
but there is one cloud on the horizon .
china 's leaders are trying to cool down growth rates that - at 9.1 % in 2003 - they fear may be too rapid to be sustainable .
success could mean cutting imports of basic commodities , leading to falling demand and price cuts .

the £ 1.8m centre will be based at the university hospital of wales in cardiff and will house a 10 bed ward to treat teenagers from south and mid wales .
patients in north wales already have access to a similar facility in liverpool , but there have been calls for some time for similar facilities to be provided in the south .
it will be the first time specific provision has been made for treating teenagers with cancer in wales and will put a stop to teenagers being treated alongside young children or geriatrics .
according to the teenage cancer trust - which is behind the plan - between 1999 and 2001 there were 270 cases of cancer in the 14-23 age group in wales .
a welsh donor has already given £ 650,000 and the trust has pledged £ 650,000 from its central funds for the unit .
a fundraising drive to meet the remainder of the cost is launched on monday .
around £ 500,000 is still needed .
the project has the support of celebrities like kelly jones , lead singer with the stereophonics .
" the work that teenage cancer trust is doing is vital and it is great that they made a commitment to wales where there are currently no specific facilities for teenagers with cancer , " he said .
" i have supported the charity for a few years now through performances at the royal albert hall and i have always loved the idea that through our music we can give something back that directly benefits the kids and such a good charity . "
the new unit will be called skypad , and will be designed with a futuristic appearance .
it will be built on stilts between the adult and the paediatric centres at uhw .
teenagers from south and mid wales are usually cared for on wards alongside children or much older patients and the trust says the new facility - which will be equipped with the latest technology - will be designed specifically to satisfy the needs of teenagers .
computers and high-tech games will help keep them entertained while they are receiving treatment .
there will also be a kitchen to allow the teenagers and their parents and friends to feel more at home .
ward problems although young people develop specific types of cancer and have different medical and psychological needs , they are usually treated with children or adults .
leukaemia , lymphoma and brain tumours are the most common types of cancer affecting children and teenagers .
three-quarters of the teenagers questioned for a recent survey for the teenage cancer trust said they had been put in wards with young children or adults .
most would have preferred to be in wards with other adolescents .
dr meriel jenney , a consultant paediatric oncologist at the university hospital of wales said teenagers and young adults had particular needs which are different to those of adults and children .
" they need specialist care because of the rarity of the tumours they get and also for the particular psychological and social problems they experience , " she said .
" their lives are changing - they are moving from education to the world of work and they have cancer on top of that .
it can be a very difficult time for them . "

around £ 500,000 is still needed .
the project has the support of celebrities like kelly jones , lead singer with the stereophonics .
around 1,500 teens develop cancer in the uk each year " the work that teenage cancer trust is doing is vital and it is great that they made a commitment to wales where there are currently no specific facilities for teenagers with cancer , " he said .
" i have supported the charity for a few years now through performances at the royal albert hall and i have always loved the idea that through our music we can give something back that directly benefits the kids and such a good charity . "
the new unit will be called skypad , and will be designed with a futuristic appearance .
it will be built on stilts between the adult and the paediatric centres at uhw .
teenagers from south and mid wales are usually cared for on wards alongside children or much older patients and the trust says the new facility - which will be equipped with the latest technology - will be designed specifically to satisfy the needs of teenagers .
computers and high-tech games will help keep them entertained while they are receiving treatment .
there will also be a kitchen to allow the teenagers and their parents and friends to feel more at home .
ward problems although young people develop specific types of cancer and have different medical and psychological needs , they are usually treated with children or adults .
leukaemia , lymphoma and brain tumours are the most common types of cancer affecting children and teenagers .
three-quarters of the teenagers questioned for a recent survey for the teenage cancer trust said they had been put in wards with young children or adults .
most would have preferred to be in wards with other adolescents .
dr meriel jenney , a consultant paediatric oncologist at the university hospital of wales said teenagers and young adults had particular needs which are different to those of adults and children .
" they need specialist care because of the rarity of the tumours they get and also for the particular psychological and social problems they experience , " she said .
" their lives are changing - they are moving from education to the world of work and they have cancer on top of that .
it can be a very difficult time for them . "

of the top seven banks , mizuho - the world 's largest bank by assets - and four others all reported solid figures .
mizuho 's 407bn yen profit -lrb- $ 3.6bn ; $ 2bn -rrb- followed a 2.4 trillion yen loss in 2002-3 .
but ufj , the number four " megabank " in japan , said it had made a loss as heavy bad debts continued to weigh it down .
ufj reported a loss of 402.8bn yen , making three straight years of losses .
its bad debts rose to 3.95 trillion yen , up 6.5 % in six months , and its president has announced he will resign .
and resona holdings , the fifth-biggest bank , also recorded heavy losses as its efforts to clean up its balance sheet ate into its bottom line .

these solid results seem to be evidence that years of groaning under the weight of trillions of yen in bad debts accumulated during the free-spending 1980s may be coming to an end .
the debts were secured against shares and property , both of which crashed in value during the 1990s .
that wrought shocking damage to japanese banks , whose balance sheets were also heavily dependent on cross-holdings of allied companies ' shares for their asset base .
ever since , they have struggled to write off debts under government pressure , although criticism has frequently been levelled at both sides for failing to act with sufficient speed and rigour .
share gain finally , the efforts appear to be paying off .
even resona 's huge loss is largely the result of a 1 trillion yen increase in spending on reducing the loans , which are down to 1.86 trillion yen from 2.88 trillion yen .
but the 2003-4 turnaround is also the result of a resurgence on the stock market , up 47 % over the year .
a windfall tax refund of almost 200bn yen from tokyo 's city government also helped support the results .

university of texas research found that , while men are far less likely to develop breast tumours than women , the numbers are increasing .
writing in an online edition of the journal cancer , they warn men seem to be unaware they can develop the cancer .
uk experts said the cancer was rare , but men should be aware of changes . "
it is important to visit your gp straight away if you notice any change in your body that is not normal " henry scowcroft , cancer research uk the researchers looked at a national cancer institute data on cancer incidence and survival in the us from 1973 to 1998 .
they found that , over the last 20 years , the incidence of male breast cancer had increased from 0.86 to 1.08 per 100,000 men .
they then examined 2,524 cases of male breast cancer and 380,856 cases of female breast cancer on the database , diagnosed over that period .
the researchers found that compared to female patients , men tended to be significantly older when they were diagnosed - 67 years versus 62 years of age .
they were also more likely to have later stage disease and had more spread of the cancer to their lymph nodes .
' easier to spot ' professor sharon giordano , who led the research , said : " male breast cancer is rare , accounting for less than one per cent of all breast cancer . "
but she said : " men should be alert to the possibility that the disease could affect them . "
professor giordano added : " it 's perhaps ironic that tumours in men are easier to feel than they are in women , yet the disease is being discovered at a later stage in men than in women . "
the researchers say that part of the reason for late diagnosis may be that men assume they are experiencing a benign condition called gynecomastia , or breast tissue growth , that affects about a third of males at some point in their lives .
the condition , which is common in teenage boys , can come and go over a man 's lifetime .
professor giordano said : " men may think new growth of breast tissue is just another occurrence of this condition . "
the team also found that men often had more larger tumours which had spread further and more aggressive forms of cancer when they were diagnosed .
however , survival rates for men and women were no different .
the researchers said men were more likely than women to have oestrogen-positive tumours .
professor giordano : " we are not sure why this is so , but it may indicate some important differences in tumour biology .
" in addition , this implies that use of tamoxifen in men may be as beneficial as it is to many women . "
she added : " now that we have a clearer understanding of the biology of breast cancer in men , further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for men . "
' campaigns aimed at women ' henry scowcroft , science information officer at cancer research uk said : " breast cancer is very rare among uk men , and when it does occur , it tends to do so between the ages of 60 and 70 .
" only about 300 men are diagnosed with the disease each year , compared with about 41,000 new cases in women .
because of this , most breast cancer awareness campaigns are aimed at women .
" while cancer research uk does not recommend that men , especially young men , examine themselves regularly , it is important to visit your gp straight away if you notice any change in your body that is not normal . "

university of texas research found that , while men are far less likely to develop breast tumours than women , the numbers are increasing .
writing in an online edition of the journal cancer , they warn men seem to be unaware they can develop the cancer .
uk experts said the cancer was rare , but men should be aware of changes .
it is important to visit your gp straight away if you notice any change in your body that is not normal henry scowcroft , cancer research uk the researchers looked at a national cancer institute data on cancer incidence and survival in the us from 1973 to 1998 .
they found that , over the last 20 years , the incidence of male breast cancer had increased from 0.86 to 1.08 per 100,000 men .
they then examined 2,524 cases of male breast cancer and 380,856 cases of female breast cancer on the database , diagnosed over that period .
the researchers found that compared to female patients , men tended to be significantly older when they were diagnosed - 67 years versus 62 years of age .
they were also more likely to have later stage disease and had more spread of the cancer to their lymph nodes .
' easier to spot ' professor sharon giordano , who led the research , said : " male breast cancer is rare , accounting for less than one per cent of all breast cancer . "
but she said : " men should be alert to the possibility that the disease could affect them . "
professor giordano added : " it 's perhaps ironic that tumours in men are easier to feel than they are in women , yet the disease is being discovered at a later stage in men than in women . "
the researchers say that part of the reason for late diagnosis may be that men assume they are experiencing a benign condition called gynecomastia , or breast tissue growth , that affects about a third of males at some point in their lives .
the condition , which is common in teenage boys , can come and go over a man 's lifetime .
professor giordano said : " men may think new growth of breast tissue is just another occurrence of this condition . "
the team also found that men often had more larger tumours which had spread further and more aggressive forms of cancer when they were diagnosed .
however , survival rates for men and women were no different .
the researchers said men were more likely than women to have oestrogen-positive tumours .
professor giordano : " we are not sure why this is so , but it may indicate some important differences in tumour biology .
" in addition , this implies that use of tamoxifen in men may be as beneficial as it is to many women . "
she added : " now that we have a clearer understanding of the biology of breast cancer in men , further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for men . "

in its first direct response to mr chen 's inauguration speech last week , china warned that peace between beijing and taipei was in danger .
china said it would safeguard the island 's sovereignty and territorial integrity at any cost , even militarily .
china views taiwan as part of its territory , and has threatened to invade if taiwan declared independence .
in his inauguration speech , president chen called for better relations with beijing , and said he would keep taiwanese independence off the political agenda during efforts to draw up a new constitution .
the united states described his address as " responsible and constructive " .
but on monday , a spokesman for beijing 's taiwan affairs office criticised mr chen for refusing to concede that taiwan was a part of " one china " .
" chen shui-bian has shown no sincerity to improve relations , " said spokesman zhang mingqing .
the content of the whole speech was about taiwan 's status as an independent country , he said .
china would " pay any price " to safeguard its territory , he added .
" we will thoroughly crush schemes for taiwan independence . "
asked if china would risk imperilling the 2008 beijing olympics , he said : " some people are asking will the olympic games be influenced .
if chen shui-bian dares to challenge the people of the world ... we will safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity at any cost " .
the rhetoric was harsh but not unexpected , according to the bbc 's taiwan correspondent , chris hogg .
last week , beijing made its views plain even before president chen stood up to deliver his acceptance speech for his second term in office .
in a strongly-worded statement , it warned that any moves towards independence would be crushed , although analysts saw some hints of flexibility in beijing 's position .
this latest warning from china proves that the peril affecting peace and stability in the region still exists , our correspondent says .
there was no immediate response from taipei , but the island 's sometimes jittery stock market remained calm - a reflection , perhaps , that such threats by the mainland are not unusual nor unexpected .

the authority is under threat of being forced to reduce council tax bills , which the government says are too high .
at the end of april the government announced it was going to cap torbay 's spending .
but the authority is not happy about the move , partly because it has been causing unexpected problems .
direct debits nearly 200 people have cancelled their council tax direct debits .
they are thought to be concerned about paying too much , even though the council has insisted nobody will end up out of pocket .
if torbay 's spending is capped , direct debits will be adjusted downwards , although the authority hopes it will not come to that .
on monday councillors will be in london to put their case to local government minister nick raynsford , against being capped .
a final decision should then be announced in a few weeks .
