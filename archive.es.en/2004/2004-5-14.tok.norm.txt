the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .
it also worried others who feared the government was trying to influence the country 's industrial policy . a national champion ? german chancellor gerhard schröder is thought to have favored a deutsche bank takeover of postbank and in recent weeks called for efforts to consolidate germany 's banking sector with the aim of making a national bank that could compete internationally .
but deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann had favored a merger with another european bank , setting of an internal row within deutsche bank about the deal . deutsche bank " handled this in a very unprofessional manner and did not correctly protect the trust of their clients , " banking analyst konrad becker from merck finck told the german news agency dpa . zumwinkel 's announcement ends speculation over the postbank ipo , but the affair has hurt germany 's image in financial circles according to some observers .
" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .
a price range for the shares is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
the company said it plans to use the money on a strategic expansion - possibly in austria or denmark . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.05.2004 psychological warfare goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting the web as a weapon while some terrorism experts describe the online video of the beheading of an american as an isolated incident , others see it as an example of long-established psychological warfare tactics . using the internet is not a new mode of operation for terrorist organizations .
many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .

" it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .

denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .
the country 's civil servants received the afternoon off to join in the celebrations and many others took the day off work to witness the first wedding of a danish heir to the throne since current queen margrethe married her husband , prince henri , in 1967 . fairy tale romance donaldson , 32 , who will now be known as crown princess mary , previously worked as a real estate agent and marketing executive . the native of hobart , tasmania did n't know that frederik was a prince when she met him , and the first year of their relationship was kept secret so that they could get to know each other outside the glare of the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the royal kiss .
donaldson has described their romance as a fairy tale , and has endeared herself to the people of denmark by learning the language , adopting danish citizenship , and converting to the lutheran church . frederik , who is three years older than his bride , is also popular among danes for his common touch .
lately , his popularity has increased as he showed that he can do more than open hospitals and plant trees : a fan of extreme sports , in 2000 , the crown prince went on a dogsled trek spanning 2,795 kilometers -lrb- 1,730 miles -rrb- along northern greenland , which belongs to denmark . heavy security despite the monarchy 's approval ratings of 82 percent , several thousand police officers lined the streets to protect the wedding guests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.05.2004 psychological warfare goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting the web as a weapon while some terrorism experts describe the online video of the beheading of an american as an isolated incident , others see it as an example of long-established psychological warfare tactics . using the internet is not a new mode of operation for terrorist organizations .
many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .

but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.05.2004 psychological warfare goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting the web as a weapon while some terrorism experts describe the online video of the beheading of an american as an isolated incident , others see it as an example of long-established psychological warfare tactics . using the internet is not a new mode of operation for terrorist organizations .
many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .

" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .
it also worried others who feared the government was trying to influence the country 's industrial policy . a national champion ? german chancellor gerhard schröder is thought to have favored a deutsche bank takeover of postbank and in recent weeks called for efforts to consolidate germany 's banking sector with the aim of making a national bank that could compete internationally .
but deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann had favored a merger with another european bank , setting of an internal row within deutsche bank about the deal . deutsche bank " handled this in a very unprofessional manner and did not correctly protect the trust of their clients , " banking analyst konrad becker from merck finck told the german news agency dpa . zumwinkel 's announcement ends speculation over the postbank ipo , but the affair has hurt germany 's image in financial circles according to some observers .
" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .
a price range for the shares is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
the company said it plans to use the money on a strategic expansion - possibly in austria or denmark . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.05.2004 psychological warfare goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting the web as a weapon while some terrorism experts describe the online video of the beheading of an american as an isolated incident , others see it as an example of long-established psychological warfare tactics . using the internet is not a new mode of operation for terrorist organizations .
many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .

" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .

" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2004 bremen 's unstoppable goal machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton led werder bremen to the title this season .
this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.05.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc breakthrough in talks with switzerland the european union on thursday finally overcame internal differences to clear the way for bern and brussels to sign a set of nine bilateral treaties .
these will give switzerland membership of the schengen agreement - which would allow it free movement of people across the eu borders - but with an opt-out on sharing information about tax evasion .
switzerland was concerned these would threaten banking secrecy .
in return , switzerland will sign up to the eu ’ s savings tax directive and levy a withholding tax of 35 percent on eu residents ’ savings income in swiss banks .
switzerland had refused to sign the deal on taxation until the eu gave bern an exemption on a part of another treaty – schengen – to protect banking secrecy .
on thursday , eu members finally overcame their own differences , and agreed to grant the swiss this opt-out .
the eu 's member states assured luxembourg they would not be forced to abandon any banking secrecy rules which switzerland would be permitted to keep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2004 police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free worm code : pre-programmed and available for download online an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience . police in the german state of lower saxony are continuing their probe into the confessed 18-year-old programmer of the " sasser " internet worm , which brought computer networks to a halt last week .
their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .
the country 's civil servants received the afternoon off to join in the celebrations and many others took the day off work to witness the first wedding of a danish heir to the throne since current queen margrethe married her husband , prince henri , in 1967 . fairy tale romance donaldson , 32 , who will now be known as crown princess mary , previously worked as a real estate agent and marketing executive . the native of hobart , tasmania did n't know that frederik was a prince when she met him , and the first year of their relationship was kept secret so that they could get to know each other outside the glare of the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the royal kiss .
donaldson has described their romance as a fairy tale , and has endeared herself to the people of denmark by learning the language , adopting danish citizenship , and converting to the lutheran church . frederik , who is three years older than his bride , is also popular among danes for his common touch .
lately , his popularity has increased as he showed that he can do more than open hospitals and plant trees : a fan of extreme sports , in 2000 , the crown prince went on a dogsled trek spanning 2,795 kilometers -lrb- 1,730 miles -rrb- along northern greenland , which belongs to denmark . heavy security despite the monarchy 's approval ratings of 82 percent , several thousand police officers lined the streets to protect the wedding guests .
the air space over the city was closed while police boats patrolled the harbor . the royal entourage wo n't have much time to recover from friday night 's wedding banquet at fredensborg castle .
next saturday it 's on to spain , where crown prince felipe will marry letizia ortiz , a former tv journalist .

" touropa " should be in business by the beginning of next year , the company said on friday in hannover .
the launch of the site marks a departure for tui , which became market leader by selling its catalogue-listed package holidays through travel agents .
customers will soon be able to book the same packages online at prices that will be updated daily .
conventional travel agencies will also be able to book clients on tui packages via the touropa web site .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .

airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .

not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .

the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .

denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .
the country 's civil servants received the afternoon off to join in the celebrations and many others took the day off work to witness the first wedding of a danish heir to the throne since current queen margrethe married her husband , prince henri , in 1967 . fairy tale romance donaldson , 32 , who will now be known as crown princess mary , previously worked as a real estate agent and marketing executive . the native of hobart , tasmania did n't know that frederik was a prince when she met him , and the first year of their relationship was kept secret so that they could get to know each other outside the glare of the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the royal kiss .
donaldson has described their romance as a fairy tale , and has endeared herself to the people of denmark by learning the language , adopting danish citizenship , and converting to the lutheran church . frederik , who is three years older than his bride , is also popular among danes for his common touch .
lately , his popularity has increased as he showed that he can do more than open hospitals and plant trees : a fan of extreme sports , in 2000 , the crown prince went on a dogsled trek spanning 2,795 kilometers -lrb- 1,730 miles -rrb- along northern greenland , which belongs to denmark . heavy security despite the monarchy 's approval ratings of 82 percent , several thousand police officers lined the streets to protect the wedding guests .
the air space over the city was closed while police boats patrolled the harbor . the royal entourage wo n't have much time to recover from friday night 's wedding banquet at fredensborg castle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2004 bremen 's unstoppable goal machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton led werder bremen to the title this season .
this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2004 bremen 's unstoppable goal machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton led werder bremen to the title this season .
this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

the hope is that the nh90 helicopter will become widely used as an export tool , and manager fabrice brégier is expecting 50 clients this year . the worst may be over it 's all good news for an industry which has been struggling to stay airborne over the past three years .
with a weak world economy , the sept .
11th terrorist attacks and then the sars epidemic , air travel hit a bad patch of turbulence , from which it is only now beginning to emerge .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .

" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .

the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade visitors to the ila , watch display flight of eurocopter transport helicopter nh 90-1 helicopter manufacturer eurocopter has also been seeking to attract new business in the german capital .
the hope is that the nh90 helicopter will become widely used as an export tool , and manager fabrice brégier is expecting 50 clients this year . the worst may be over it 's all good news for an industry which has been struggling to stay airborne over the past three years .
with a weak world economy , the sept .
11th terrorist attacks and then the sars epidemic , air travel hit a bad patch of turbulence , from which it is only now beginning to emerge .
the most important indicator that the industry is on an upward turn again are reports from airlines themselves that passenger numbers are back on the rise .

this weekend , the show , which has so far only been open to trade visitors , will throw open its doors to the general public .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .
it also worried others who feared the government was trying to influence the country 's industrial policy . a national champion ? german chancellor gerhard schröder is thought to have favored a deutsche bank takeover of postbank and in recent weeks called for efforts to consolidate germany 's banking sector with the aim of making a national bank that could compete internationally .
but deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann had favored a merger with another european bank , setting of an internal row within deutsche bank about the deal . deutsche bank " handled this in a very unprofessional manner and did not correctly protect the trust of their clients , " banking analyst konrad becker from merck finck told the german news agency dpa . zumwinkel 's announcement ends speculation over the postbank ipo , but the affair has hurt germany 's image in financial circles according to some observers .
" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .
a price range for the shares is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
the company said it plans to use the money on a strategic expansion - possibly in austria or denmark . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.05.2004 psychological warfare goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting the web as a weapon while some terrorism experts describe the online video of the beheading of an american as an isolated incident , others see it as an example of long-established psychological warfare tactics . using the internet is not a new mode of operation for terrorist organizations .
many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .
" what we have to do is make this country a democracy .
if we ca n't do that , this problem is going to be there .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2004 bremen 's unstoppable goal machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton led werder bremen to the title this season .
this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .
the country 's civil servants received the afternoon off to join in the celebrations and many others took the day off work to witness the first wedding of a danish heir to the throne since current queen margrethe married her husband , prince henri , in 1967 . fairy tale romance donaldson , 32 , who will now be known as crown princess mary , previously worked as a real estate agent and marketing executive . the native of hobart , tasmania did n't know that frederik was a prince when she met him , and the first year of their relationship was kept secret so that they could get to know each other outside the glare of the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the royal kiss .
donaldson has described their romance as a fairy tale , and has endeared herself to the people of denmark by learning the language , adopting danish citizenship , and converting to the lutheran church . frederik , who is three years older than his bride , is also popular among danes for his common touch .
lately , his popularity has increased as he showed that he can do more than open hospitals and plant trees : a fan of extreme sports , in 2000 , the crown prince went on a dogsled trek spanning 2,795 kilometers -lrb- 1,730 miles -rrb- along northern greenland , which belongs to denmark . heavy security despite the monarchy 's approval ratings of 82 percent , several thousand police officers lined the streets to protect the wedding guests .
the air space over the city was closed while police boats patrolled the harbor . the royal entourage wo n't have much time to recover from friday night 's wedding banquet at fredensborg castle .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets . four years after frederik and mary met at a bar in sydney during the 2000 olympic games , the groom 's eyes filled with tears as his bride , dressed in a champagne-colored gown by danish designer uffe frank and wearing the wedding veil of former danish queen ingrid , walked down the aisle . royalty from around the world , including the kings and queens of norway , spain , sweden and the netherlands as well as japan 's crown prince naruhito were in attendance as the wedding couple tied the knot in copenhagen 's our lady 's cathedral . england 's queen elizabeth ii . , who had also been the bride 's head of state until friday , sent her youngest son edward to represent her . outside the cathedral , hundreds of thousands of danes were waving danish and australian flags tourism officials had been handing out since the morning .
the country 's civil servants received the afternoon off to join in the celebrations and many others took the day off work to witness the first wedding of a danish heir to the throne since current queen margrethe married her husband , prince henri , in 1967 . fairy tale romance donaldson , 32 , who will now be known as crown princess mary , previously worked as a real estate agent and marketing executive . the native of hobart , tasmania did n't know that frederik was a prince when she met him , and the first year of their relationship was kept secret so that they could get to know each other outside the glare of the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the royal kiss .
donaldson has described their romance as a fairy tale , and has endeared herself to the people of denmark by learning the language , adopting danish citizenship , and converting to the lutheran church . frederik , who is three years older than his bride , is also popular among danes for his common touch .
lately , his popularity has increased as he showed that he can do more than open hospitals and plant trees : a fan of extreme sports , in 2000 , the crown prince went on a dogsled trek spanning 2,795 kilometers -lrb- 1,730 miles -rrb- along northern greenland , which belongs to denmark . heavy security despite the monarchy 's approval ratings of 82 percent , several thousand police officers lined the streets to protect the wedding guests .
the air space over the city was closed while police boats patrolled the harbor . the royal entourage wo n't have much time to recover from friday night 's wedding banquet at fredensborg castle .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .

" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .
it also worried others who feared the government was trying to influence the country 's industrial policy . a national champion ? german chancellor gerhard schröder is thought to have favored a deutsche bank takeover of postbank and in recent weeks called for efforts to consolidate germany 's banking sector with the aim of making a national bank that could compete internationally .
but deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann had favored a merger with another european bank , setting of an internal row within deutsche bank about the deal . deutsche bank " handled this in a very unprofessional manner and did not correctly protect the trust of their clients , " banking analyst konrad becker from merck finck told the german news agency dpa . zumwinkel 's announcement ends speculation over the postbank ipo , but the affair has hurt germany 's image in financial circles according to some observers .
" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .
a price range for the shares is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
the company said it plans to use the money on a strategic expansion - possibly in austria or denmark . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .
it also worried others who feared the government was trying to influence the country 's industrial policy . a national champion ? german chancellor gerhard schröder is thought to have favored a deutsche bank takeover of postbank and in recent weeks called for efforts to consolidate germany 's banking sector with the aim of making a national bank that could compete internationally .
but deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann had favored a merger with another european bank , setting of an internal row within deutsche bank about the deal . deutsche bank " handled this in a very unprofessional manner and did not correctly protect the trust of their clients , " banking analyst konrad becker from merck finck told the german news agency dpa . zumwinkel 's announcement ends speculation over the postbank ipo , but the affair has hurt germany 's image in financial circles according to some observers .
" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .
a price range for the shares is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
the company said it plans to use the money on a strategic expansion - possibly in austria or denmark . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2004 police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free worm code : pre-programmed and available for download online an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience . police in the german state of lower saxony are continuing their probe into the confessed 18-year-old programmer of the " sasser " internet worm , which brought computer networks to a halt last week .
their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .

" we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2004 police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free worm code : pre-programmed and available for download online an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience . police in the german state of lower saxony are continuing their probe into the confessed 18-year-old programmer of the " sasser " internet worm , which brought computer networks to a halt last week .
their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade visitors to the ila , watch display flight of eurocopter transport helicopter nh 90-1 helicopter manufacturer eurocopter has also been seeking to attract new business in the german capital .
the hope is that the nh90 helicopter will become widely used as an export tool , and manager fabrice brégier is expecting 50 clients this year . the worst may be over it 's all good news for an industry which has been struggling to stay airborne over the past three years .
with a weak world economy , the sept .
11th terrorist attacks and then the sars epidemic , air travel hit a bad patch of turbulence , from which it is only now beginning to emerge .
the most important indicator that the industry is on an upward turn again are reports from airlines themselves that passenger numbers are back on the rise .

this weekend , the show , which has so far only been open to trade visitors , will throw open its doors to the general public .

deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank . halting what some observers had considered an embarrassing back-and-forth over postbank 's fate , deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on thursday announced the decision to go ahead with the initial public offering of 49.9 percent of the company on june 21 .
he also said deutsche bank will remain as one of the global advisors of the share sale . " outside of the initial public offering there will be no sale of the postbank , partial or otherwise to domestic or foreign investors .
nor will large stakes be given to financial institutions and other strategic investors , " zumwinkel said . deutsche bank reportedly wanted to buy deutsche post 's retailing banking operations for around € 6 billion , encouraged by the german government , in the hopes of transforming itself into a national banking champion .
the government is deutsche post 's largest shareholder , controlling 62 percent of the postal services and logistics group . the possible takeover of postbank had rattled investors who saw a conflict of interest with the leading ipo advisor deutsche bank simultaneously negotiating a deal that would preempt the share sale .

" the scrap that we 've seen in recent days has n't only hurt the postbank flotation , but in particular it 's damaged germany as an investment location , " klaus nieding from the german association for the protection of securities owners told deutsche welle . deutsche post , which will now remain the majority shareholder , hopes to raise up to € 3 billion in the ipo .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

their investigation has shed light on a subculture of dilettante youth hackers capable of wreaking mass havoc because of their lack of experience in programming .
they 're often working with code that 's too sophisticated for them , and the consequences can be devastating .
earlier this week , authorities searched homes in small towns near hanover to determine whether sven j. from nearby waffensen disseminated the sasser virus with the aid of accomplices .
one has already confessed to having gotten a copy of the code from sven j. and distributing it .
investigators arrested sven j. , the main suspect , friday after an acquaintance tipped off microsoft , which then alerted police .
he now faces criminal and civil proceedings that could result in millions in damages .
the sasser worm quickly crawled to the far corners of the internet and interrupted the computer systems of millions of companies and private users .
28 ways to infect your computer microsoft has alleged that sven j. is responsible for all 28 strains of the computers worms sasser and " netsky , " which have been making the rounds on the internet since february 16 .
shortly before sven j. 's arrest , the man programmed a second variation of sasser and released it onto the internet .
investigators said they found source code for both worms on the harddrive of his seized computer .
operating system-developer microsoft has said it will provide a $ 250,000 -lrb- € 212,000 -rrb- bounty to the informant if the suspect is convicted .
computer sabotage is currently the most likely charge that will be filed against sven j. , which includes a jail term of up to five years .
in his confession to investigators with the state criminal office in hanover , the young man said he had originally sought to create an anti-virus program .
with his virus , he said , he intended to remove other viruses from computers , including " mydoom " and " bagle . "
but in the end , what he wound up with was " sasser , " a worm that disrupted the computers of delta airlines in the united states , the british coast guard and the european commission in brussels .
state criminal office director rüdiger butte said sven j. admitted he had n't thought about the possible damage the worm could cause .
attack of the ' scriptkiddies ' in an interview with the wire service agence france presse , investigators described sven j. as a so-called " scriptkiddy , " jargon for bottom feeders in the hacker hierarchy , which is comprised of hackers , crackers and scriptkiddies .
thousands are active in germany 's hacker scene - from school children to professors to security experts .
most are young , overwhelmingly male and possess a knowledge of computer programming that is far above the norm .
they meet regularly at hacker conventions , like those held by the venerated chaos computer club , which is respected for its well-intentioned hacks .
hackers are curious and they see the digital world as an adventure ground where they can cross boundaries and find security holes .
the difference between hackers and crackers is that hackers hack websites in order to bring attention to security holes , stopping before they inflict damage .
but crackers seek to inflict as much damage as possible through attacks such as denial of service , which sends so many commands at a server that it virtually cuts off access to other users .
beneath them you can find the scriptkiddies , crackers in training as it were .
most of them lack the knowledge and experience of sophisticated hackers and crackers , and they tend to download programming code that 's already available on the internet .
the reason for their success is that they 're often already using code that has proven effective in past attacks .
weak security according to investigators , that also proved to be the case with sven j. , who seized on a previously known microsoft security hole and relied on the pre-existing code for the netsky virus , which he then transformed into sasser .
as police in germany continue their investigation , some groups are pointing the finger at microsoft , with its long track record of spotty programming and security holes . the chaos computer club offered some indirect support by saying that microsoft , too , should be held liable for the security holes in its operating systems that make them so vulnerable to worms and viruses .
prosecutors believe that a court case will be brought against the sven j. in a juvenile court within a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.05.2004 industry soars at berlin air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a bumpy ride , air industry is flying back on track half way through the international aerospace exhibition , ila , in berlin , the industry seems to be back in top shape .
with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade visitors to the ila , watch display flight of eurocopter transport helicopter nh 90-1 helicopter manufacturer eurocopter has also been seeking to attract new business in the german capital .
the hope is that the nh90 helicopter will become widely used as an export tool , and manager fabrice brégier is expecting 50 clients this year . the worst may be over it 's all good news for an industry which has been struggling to stay airborne over the past three years .
with a weak world economy , the sept .
11th terrorist attacks and then the sars epidemic , air travel hit a bad patch of turbulence , from which it is only now beginning to emerge .
the most important indicator that the industry is on an upward turn again are reports from airlines themselves that passenger numbers are back on the rise .

this weekend , the show , which has so far only been open to trade visitors , will throw open its doors to the general public .
organizers are expecting up to 200,000 people to come and watch the flight display programs , learn about the latest space research and check out the state-of-the-art aircraft designed to keep the industry flying high . bernd gssler -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus overtakes boeing the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies . " in the arab world , this is seen as taking an eye for an eye , " says kai hirschmann , the deputy director of the institute for terrorism research in essen in western germany .
he describes the video as a skillful response that served a specific purpose .
" these people are n't stupid , " he says .
" they wanted to make a point that 's noticed in the west .
it 's a response to the -lsb- torture -rsb- pictures that can not be repeated regularly . " " it 's a piece of the mosaic that worked in the current situation , " he says .
" a bomb attack would not have worked as a reponse to the torturing . " but col. nick pratt -lrb- ret . -rrb- , the director of the marshall center program on terrorism and security studies in southern germany , says he does n't interpret the video as a direct response to the torture pictures . " this has nothing to do with the prison atrocities , " pratt says .
" this is a great example of psychological warfare .
they can spread this information and show the world how helpless we are . " protecting freedom on the internet as a result , self-regulation of the media is the only way to deal with this " war of pictures " as it is technically impossible to police the web , explains rainer kuhlen , a computer science professor and expert on ethics and the internet at constance university in southern germany . " we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable . " pratt believes that the west has so far focused too much on future threats of cyber terrorism , such as breaking up airline schedules and attacking bank systems and failed to recognize the significance of psychological warfare via the web . while there is little that could be done to prevent the spread of similar videos in the future , u.s. officials could do more to counter them .
" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

" we 'll have to live with this , " he says , adding that the proliferation of pornography over the internet raised similar questions in the past .
" without a doubt , these pictures are weapons of the most gruesome kind and they are meant to function as weapons .
but that does n't make ' normal ' war weapons and cultural humiliation any more ethically acceptable .

" we have to use the internet better ourselves , " he says , citing as an example pictures of iraqis demonstrating in front of baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , where the alleged torture by u.s. soldiers took place . " you have to show that it 's now safe for them to demonstrate , which is something they could n't do under saddam hussein , " pratt says .
" you have to show how democracy is starting to grow . " similarly , u.s. officials should make public the trials of military personnel accused of the torturing : " you have to put that out there and show how the military cleans out a mess . " no mogadishu while hirschmann does n't expect such isolated killings to become more frequent in the future , pratt says this depended on the media reaction to the berg video .
" if there were no reaction , you probably would n't see it again , " he says . analysts agree , however , that unlike the image of a dead u.s. soldier getting dragged through the streets of the somalian capital mogadishu in 1993 that ultimately led to an american pull-out , the video of berg 's beheading was unlikely to provoke the same in iraq . " the stakes in iraq are much greater than in somalia , " pratt maintains .

many groups , including al qaeda , have long used it as a way to recruit followers , raise money , plan attacks and communicate with each other . a few weeks ago , a terror group calling itself the green brigade offered video footage of the murder of an italian hostage to arab tv station a l-jazeera .
the editors chose not to air it because of its graphic content . now the terrorists cut out the middleman to get their message to the public : they published the video of the beheading of 26-year-old nick berg online , making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection . similar videos , including footage of chechnyan terrorists playing soccer with the severed heads of russian soldiers , have been published online before .
but the west has largely ignored them until now , says udo ulfkotte , a german terrorism expert . " it 's not a new strategy , it 's always been part of psychological warfare , " he says , adding that a video of the 2002 murder of american journalist daniel pearl was the first time westerners began paying more attention to such images on the internet . an act of revenge ?
ulfkotte suggests the footage of berg 's killing mainly served to satisfy the arab world 's hunger for revenge after seeing pictures of u.s. soldiers torturing iraqi prisoners . others agree that the video was intended to provoke cheers and recruit sympathizers in the arab world while shocking the u.s. and its allies .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

this season 's bundesliga champion werder bremen was helped to its first title in 11 years thanks in no small part to brazilian forward ailton , who is also set to become the league 's top scorer .
dw-world spoke with him . it 's been an amazing and sometimes turbulent season for werder bremen star striker ailton .
the brazilian 's 27 goals to date have made him the bundesliga 's leading forward , but his decision to leave bremen for schalke 04 next year and his attempt to play for the qatari national team also made him the center of controversy .
deutsche welle asked the player about it all . normally the german championship is dominated by fc bayern munich .
what does it feel like to win the title with a 3-1 victory in munich against bayern ? it 's the greatest .
for the first time i 'm german champion , it 's an incredibly important title .
only now have i learned the taste of a championship and especially away at munich against this great bayern team is something special .
it 's really fantastic and only those who have enjoyed having a title know the feeling . you could n't stop crying on the pitch … that 's right , there are a lot of emotions in play .
it 's the first important title of my career and i dedicate it to my brother and mother , who have also supported and helped me .
at that moment on the pitch after the whistle i could let everything out , lots of feeling and they came in the form of tears , but tears of joy .
i 'd like to always be able to cry in this way . you 'll end the season as bremen 's all-time leading scorer after already beating rudi völler 's record two matches ago and it will be hard to take the crown of the league 's best striker away from you .
what does it all mean to you ? a lot .
it 's another victory for ailton , 27 goals are an excellent result .
and taking a place in the history of werder bremen is extremely satisfying . does the direct comparison to rudi völler have a particular meaning ? it 's always important to be compared to great players .
to be compared to rudi völler is amazing . how did you manage to be such a goal-making machine this season ? with humility and hard work .
a striker always has to try to be the leading scorer and should be constantly heading after it .
i have been since i 've been in germany .
twice i nearly managed it and this year i 'm four goals ahead of -lrb- roy -rrb- makaay and i wo n't let this advantage out of my hand . after such a season , and your success with the club , how do you feel about leaving werder bremen ? it happens to every player at some point in his career .
i signed the contract with schalke pretty early and just looked to the future … but i leave bremen content that i 've made my mark as champion and leading scorer .
it will be a good departure and i hope the club continues as it has . in recent weeks there was anger over your comments about gelsenkirchen where schalke plays .
do you regret signing with schalke and turning your back on bremen where you could have played in the champions league ? no , bremen will stay there and i can visit my friends on my free days .
it 's hard to regret what i 'm doing .
i believe in the potential of the schalke team in the next season and i believe we can go where werder is now . on another topic : now that the dust has settled about you trying to play for qatar , how do you see the whole episode ? i think it was a mistake by the people that organized for me to play for qatar .
there was a lot in the press and that was annoying .
i still dream to be able to play for a national side and , of course , i 'd like to play for the brazilian eleven . has there been contact to the brazil team ?
do you have chances of playing ? i 'm hopeful , but there has n't been contact yet .
i hope the trainer has time to think over what i 've achieved in the bundesliga .
you have to show what you can do on the pitch without demanding to play .
i 'll stay where i am and shoot goals .
that 's the best way to have the coach see what i can do . interview conducted by marcio weichert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen clinch german championship the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

with contracts of € 4 billion already in the bag , the future looks bright . even before the show got underway at berlin 's schönefeld airport , the european aeronautic defence and space company , eads , took a lucrative booking for 30 ariane-5 rockets to be delivered to arianespace , europe 's premier commercial satellite launching firm . the contract , which was signed in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and the french minister of research françois d 'aubert at the show in the german capital , is a big deal .
not only will it ensure arianespace a competitive place on the international launcher market , but it will bring € 3 billion to eads and help the company plan for the longer term in a highly cyclical market .
the contract was the best possible start to a show which is being widely seen as an indicator of the health of the air industry on the whole .
expanding opportunities the momentum has n't slowed , and the overall vibe of the third largest aerospace show has been filled with a feeling of opportunity .
" ila 2004 has been greatly influenced by nato and eu expansion , " said rainer hertrich , president of the german aerospace industries association .
almost 1,000 exhibitors from 43 different countries have flown in to show their wares , and among the most prominent participants besides those from western europe and the usa , are russia and the ukraine .
their air collections include a 75-meter-long passenger plane , which is officially the longest in the world , the a340-600 airbus , and the ukrainian antonov 124-100 , the largest plane thus far , which has the capacity to carry up to 150 tons .
airbus secured its biggest sale of the year during the show , with the u.s. budget airline spirit putting in an order for 11 airbus a319s and four a320s .
the company also reserved an option on a further 50 aircraft .
the order could keep airbus ahead of its main rival , u.s.-based boeing , which is the largest manufacturer in the world .
airbus is currently filling annual orders for 300 aircraft , whilst last year boeing only delivered 281 planes .

after it was pipped in its bid to host the 2006 competition , world governing body fifa agreed that the 2010 tournament must be held in africa under a new rotation system .
south africa is up against morocco and egypt for the host 's role , -lrb- tunisia and libya are outside bets -rrb- , with millions set to flow into the economy of which ever country gets the nod .
income projected for south africa as host nation is estimated at about $ 550m -lrb- £ 313m -rrb- , without contributions from fifa and the other millions from football tourism .
economic growth naturally , tourism in whichever country wins the nomination will be boosted , and in neighbouring nations too .
there would be construction , telecoms , and merchandising opportunities , and a general impetus to economic growth .
in addition there is the value of broadcasting and marketing rights , and money spent on accommodation , food , entertainment and transport by the 280,000 fans expected to pour into the host country .
the winning nation would also see its international image and profile boosted , which would be of particular advantage to south africa . "
the winning country may be tempted to divert cash away from projects set up to tackle illiteracy or unemployment ... and into stadium building " abah ofon , africa economist , standard chartered bank " it will be a positive in so many ways for the successful country , " says tim ash , an emerging markets specialist at bear stearns .
" tourism would be a major winner , although south africa , and morocco and egypt , already do well in that respect .
" it will give a boost to the image of the successful country , which in itself can help bring in more trade .
" there has been a big effort to cut crime in south africa , and this may concentrate minds in the country to continue that drive and also to address other issues , such as hiv / aids .
" there are many positives , the construction industry will be boosted by stadium building , and improving infrastructure generally , such as roads , rail and telecommunications .
" it will also help change perceptions of africa , and african business , in the way the 2002 tournament updated perceptions of asia . "
regional economy an economic impact study , drawn up for south african soccer bodies , said hosting the finals would create about 160,000 jobs .
at the moment there is 35 % unemployment in the country .
south africa has already successfully hosted the cricket world cup in 2003 , the 1995 rugby world cup and the 1996 african nations cup .
after losing out to germany for the 2006 wc by one vote , soccer-mad south africans are praying this will be their big moment .
but morocco and egypt are lurking to take advantage of any possible fears among the 24-strong fifa executive committee surrounding south africa 's high crime rate .
south africa is also further from europe than other bidders .
but mr ash said : " security could be more of an issue in egypt and morocco .
" and south africa 's distance could boost the whole regional economy , as fans may decide to visit other countries after having travelled all that way . "
south africa 's neighbours , such as swaziland , lesotho and botswana , could also be used as team bases - raising the profiles of those nations .
' service industry ' last year the budget estimated to host the tournament in south africa was put at more than $ 500m .
the south african 2010 world cup bid committee has requested $ 30m for stadium development alone .
the economic benefits would be spread across south africa , as the 64 matches would be played at 13 stadiums from polokwane to cape town .
abah ofon , specialist on the african economy at standard chartered bank agrees there are great benefits to the winning nation 's economy , image , and prestige , but sounds a note of caution .
" there will be a fiscal stimulus , and it will affect gdp in the short-term .
" it would also help countries like south african , heavily based on mining , and morocco , which depends a lot on agriculture , to develop their service economies .
" hotel bookings , travel , and personal consumption by visitors will all stimulate that side of things .
" the fear is the winning country may be tempted to divert cash away from projects set up to tackle illiteracy or unemployment , or to provide social housing , and into stadium building .
" both morocco and south africa have set up worthwhile projects , and there is a danger they may move money from these to grandiose stadiums that are not needed after the tournament . "
' organisational skills ' awarding the showpiece event to south africa would send a message fifa believes the wealth generated by the world 's biggest sport should be spread and shared amongst the poorest countries .
however , morocco and egypt are still strong contenders .
whichever country wins , it seems their economy will be given a much-needed stimulus , but football officials feel the whole continent is already a winner .
as african football federation president issa hayatou says : " our struggle to host the world cup 2010 was made possible by the remarkable progress of african football , organizational skills and in sports management on the continent .
after many years , our efforts have been rewarded . "

the oecd said workers should be encouraged to retire later to offset a 5-year increase in life expectancy .
improved life expectancy burdens are already stretching pension systems .
for the rich countries , the number of workers for each pensioner is expected to fall from four workers for each pensioner now , to just two in 2050 .
shortfall the pension crisis is worst in continental europe , said the oecd - a body which represents the 30 leading industrial countries .
systems in spain , france , germany and italy could all face significant shortfalls by 2050 , ranging from an estimated 4 % of economic output in france to 8 % in spain .
and the european problems have been exacerbated by a dramatic fall in fertility , especially in southern europe , where the average woman only has 1.3 children , far below the replacement rate of 2.1 .
that means that there will be even fewer workers in the future to pay for pensions .
' compulsion needed ' efforts to reform european pension systems have been stymied by strong opposition from unions .
however , jean-philippe cotis , the oecd 's chief economist , told bbc news online that the delay in starting pension reform would mean that an element of compulsion was now essential in ensuring that workers save enough for retirement .
according to mr cotis , the pensions crisis will have to be solved by a combination of higher taxes , cuts in benefits , and a longer working life .
but increasing taxes too much could be counter-productive , because high taxes on labour in europe are already contributing to high unemployment .
instead , the oecd is urging governments to increase labour force participation rates .
only half of people over 55 in oecd countries are in the labour force now , and better training , changes in tax and benefit policy , and age discrimination legislation could increase that percentage by at least 10 % in some countries .
scandinavian model the oecd is also urging countries to try and encourage more women back into the workforce through flexible family policies and subsidies for childcare .
it pointed out that the scandinavian countries , which follow these policies , do not have a pensions crisis .
iceland is the country where workers stay in the workforce longest , due to the strong financial incentives to retire at 70 .
and it may not be a coincidence that iceland is also the country with the highest male life expectancy in the world , the deputy oecd general secretary , berglind asgeirsdottir , told the bbc .
high health care costs in the future could also make the problem worse , although there is a fierce debate as to whether the new generation of pensioners will be healthier than past generation as well as living longer .
private provision jean pierre garnier , the chief executive of glaxosmithkline , told bbc news online that european countries needed to partly privatise their health care systems to cut costs and end dependence on a single-payer state system .
he said that introducing co-payments by patients and consumer choice was essential to drive down costs and provide further funds which can not be met by over-burdened state budgets .
for the anglo-saxon countries like the us and britain , the crisis for the state pension system is less severe , but private sector pension schemes are under severe pressure .
mr cotis said that in the uk , the low level of state pension benefits means that the state pension system is solvent well into the future .
however , he added , the problem with this is that there may be many very poor elderly people who will have to be supported by another part of the state budget .

" it will give a boost to the image of the successful country , which in itself can help bring in more trade .
" there has been a big effort to cut crime in south africa , and this may concentrate minds in the country to continue that drive and also to address other issues , such as hiv / aids .
" there are many positives , the construction industry will be boosted by stadium building , and improving infrastructure generally , such as roads , rail and telecommunications .
" it will also help change perceptions of africa , and african business , in the way the 2002 tournament updated perceptions of asia . "
regional economy an economic impact study , drawn up for south african soccer bodies , said hosting the finals would create about 160,000 jobs .
at the moment there is 35 % unemployment in the country .
south africa has already successfully hosted the cricket world cup in 2003 , the 1995 rugby world cup and the 1996 african nations cup .
thousands gathered at giza to support egypt 's world cup bid after losing out to germany for the 2006 wc by one vote , soccer-mad south africans are praying this will be their big moment .
but morocco and egypt are lurking to take advantage of any possible fears among the 24-strong fifa executive committee surrounding south africa 's high crime rate .
south africa is also further from europe than other bidders .
but mr ash said : " security could be more of an issue in egypt and morocco .
" and south africa 's distance could boost the whole regional economy , as fans may decide to visit other countries after having travelled all that way . "
south africa 's neighbours , such as swaziland , lesotho and botswana , could also be used as team bases - raising the profiles of those nations .
' service industry ' last year the budget estimated to host the tournament in south africa was put at more than $ 500m .
the south african 2010 world cup bid committee has requested $ 30m for stadium development alone .
the economic benefits would be spread across south africa , as the 64 matches would be played at 13 stadiums from polokwane to cape town .
abah ofon , specialist on the african economy at standard chartered bank agrees there are great benefits to the winning nation 's economy , image , and prestige , but sounds a note of caution .
morocco is still forceably putting its case to host the 2010 competition " there will be a fiscal stimulus , and it will affect gdp in the short-term .
" it would also help countries like south african , heavily based on mining , and morocco , which depends a lot on agriculture , to develop their service economies .
" hotel bookings , travel , and personal consumption by visitors will all stimulate that side of things .
" the fear is the winning country may be tempted to divert cash away from projects set up to tackle illiteracy or unemployment , or to provide social housing , and into stadium building .
" both morocco and south africa have set up worthwhile projects , and there is a danger they may move money from these to grandiose stadiums that are not needed after the tournament . "
' organisational skills ' awarding the showpiece event to south africa would send a message fifa believes the wealth generated by the world 's biggest sport should be spread and shared amongst the poorest countries .
however , morocco and egypt are still strong contenders .
whichever country wins , it seems their economy will be given a much-needed stimulus , but football officials feel the whole continent is already a winner .
as african football federation president issa hayatou says : " our struggle to host the world cup 2010 was made possible by the remarkable progress of african football , organizational skills and in sports management on the continent .
after many years , our efforts have been rewarded . "

european pension systems are crumbling the oecd said workers should be encouraged to retire later to offset a 5-year increase in life expectancy .
improved life expectancy burdens are already stretching pension systems .
for the rich countries , the number of workers for each pensioner is expected to fall from four workers for each pensioner now , to just two in 2050 .
shortfall the pension crisis is worst in continental europe , said the oecd - a body which represents the 30 leading industrial countries .
systems in spain , france , germany and italy could all face significant shortfalls by 2050 , ranging from an estimated 4 % of economic output in france to 8 % in spain .
and the european problems have been exacerbated by a dramatic fall in fertility , especially in southern europe , where the average woman only has 1.3 children , far below the replacement rate of 2.1 .
that means that there will be even fewer workers in the future to pay for pensions .
' compulsion needed ' efforts to reform european pension systems have been stymied by strong opposition from unions .
however , jean-philippe cotis , the oecd 's chief economist , told bbc news online that the delay in starting pension reform would mean that an element of compulsion was now essential in ensuring that workers save enough for retirement .
according to mr cotis , the pensions crisis will have to be solved by a combination of higher taxes , cuts in benefits , and a longer working life .
but increasing taxes too much could be counter-productive , because high taxes on labour in europe are already contributing to high unemployment .
instead , the oecd is urging governments to increase labour force participation rates .
only half of people over 55 in oecd countries are in the labour force now , and better training , changes in tax and benefit policy , and age discrimination legislation could increase that percentage by at least 10 % in some countries .
scandinavian model the oecd is also urging countries to try and encourage more women back into the workforce through flexible family policies and subsidies for childcare .
working women reduce the risk of a pension crisis it pointed out that the scandinavian countries , which follow these policies , do not have a pensions crisis .
iceland is the country where workers stay in the workforce longest , due to the strong financial incentives to retire at 70 .
and it may not be a coincidence that iceland is also the country with the highest male life expectancy in the world , the deputy oecd general secretary , berglind asgeirsdottir , told the bbc .
high health care costs in the future could also make the problem worse , although there is a fierce debate as to whether the new generation of pensioners will be healthier than past generation as well as living longer .
private provision jean pierre garnier , the chief executive of glaxosmithkline , told bbc news online that european countries needed to partly privatise their health care systems to cut costs and end dependence on a single-payer state system .
he said that introducing co-payments by patients and consumer choice was essential to drive down costs and provide further funds which can not be met by over-burdened state budgets .
for the anglo-saxon countries like the us and britain , the crisis for the state pension system is less severe , but private sector pension schemes are under severe pressure .
mr cotis said that in the uk , the low level of state pension benefits means that the state pension system is solvent well into the future .
however , he added , the problem with this is that there may be many very poor elderly people who will have to be supported by another part of the state budget .

the winning nation would also see its international image and profile boosted , which would be of particular advantage to south africa .
the winning country may be tempted to divert cash away from projects set up to tackle illiteracy or unemployment ... and into stadium building abah ofon , africa economist , standard chartered bank " it will be a positive in so many ways for the successful country , " says tim ash , an emerging markets specialist at bear stearns .
" tourism would be a major winner , although south africa , and morocco and egypt , already do well in that respect .
" it will give a boost to the image of the successful country , which in itself can help bring in more trade .
" there has been a big effort to cut crime in south africa , and this may concentrate minds in the country to continue that drive and also to address other issues , such as hiv / aids .
" there are many positives , the construction industry will be boosted by stadium building , and improving infrastructure generally , such as roads , rail and telecommunications .
" it will also help change perceptions of africa , and african business , in the way the 2002 tournament updated perceptions of asia . "
regional economy an economic impact study , drawn up for south african soccer bodies , said hosting the finals would create about 160,000 jobs .
at the moment there is 35 % unemployment in the country .
south africa has already successfully hosted the cricket world cup in 2003 , the 1995 rugby world cup and the 1996 african nations cup .
thousands gathered at giza to support egypt 's world cup bid after losing out to germany for the 2006 wc by one vote , soccer-mad south africans are praying this will be their big moment .
but morocco and egypt are lurking to take advantage of any possible fears among the 24-strong fifa executive committee surrounding south africa 's high crime rate .
south africa is also further from europe than other bidders .
but mr ash said : " security could be more of an issue in egypt and morocco .
" and south africa 's distance could boost the whole regional economy , as fans may decide to visit other countries after having travelled all that way . "
south africa 's neighbours , such as swaziland , lesotho and botswana , could also be used as team bases - raising the profiles of those nations .
' service industry ' last year the budget estimated to host the tournament in south africa was put at more than $ 500m .
the south african 2010 world cup bid committee has requested $ 30m for stadium development alone .
the economic benefits would be spread across south africa , as the 64 matches would be played at 13 stadiums from polokwane to cape town .
abah ofon , specialist on the african economy at standard chartered bank agrees there are great benefits to the winning nation 's economy , image , and prestige , but sounds a note of caution .
morocco is still forceably putting its case to host the 2010 competition " there will be a fiscal stimulus , and it will affect gdp in the short-term .
" it would also help countries like south african , heavily based on mining , and morocco , which depends a lot on agriculture , to develop their service economies .
" hotel bookings , travel , and personal consumption by visitors will all stimulate that side of things .
" the fear is the winning country may be tempted to divert cash away from projects set up to tackle illiteracy or unemployment , or to provide social housing , and into stadium building .
" both morocco and south africa have set up worthwhile projects , and there is a danger they may move money from these to grandiose stadiums that are not needed after the tournament . "
' organisational skills ' awarding the showpiece event to south africa would send a message fifa believes the wealth generated by the world 's biggest sport should be spread and shared amongst the poorest countries .
however , morocco and egypt are still strong contenders .
whichever country wins , it seems their economy will be given a much-needed stimulus , but football officials feel the whole continent is already a winner .
as african football federation president issa hayatou says : " our struggle to host the world cup 2010 was made possible by the remarkable progress of african football , organizational skills and in sports management on the continent .
after many years , our efforts have been rewarded . "

consumer prices rose 3.8 % in april from a year earlier , driven mainly by increases in food costs , according to the state statistical bureau .
some economists are now predicting the first interest rate rise in nine years as policy makers try to cool growth .
premier wen jiabao this week warned that the economy risks coming off the rails after expanding 9.1 % last year .
the first three months of 2004 exceeded even that , surging to an annual rate of 9.7 % .
light-footed during his european tour , mr wen described china 's growth as " excessive " and compared himself to the driver of a speeding car that needs to slow down .
he added that : " we are now under pressure of inflation " .
during april , food prices jumped 10 % , while the cost of grain rocketed by more than a third .
beijing is already taking steps to rein in inflation , such as capping increases in utility costs and limiting lending by state banks .
economists , however , are warning that a slowdown in china 's economy may have repercussions around the globe .
the asian giant is the world 's sixth largest economy and fourth biggest exporter and its appetite for raw materials has pushed up prices worldwide .
in 2003 , china consumed 27 % of world steel , 31 % of coal and 40 % of cement .

the local education authority is considering whether to charge £ 200 a year for transport to such schools .
torbay director of education tony smith said nearly £ 500,000 a year was spent on " discretionary " transport , mainly to selective and denominational schools .
he said such spending needed to be re-assessed in a tough financial climate .
considerable opposition mr smith added that neighbouring authorities in devon and plymouth had already abolished free discretionary transport , and he suggested torbay should follow suit .
he said a proposed charge of £ 200 to parents would equate to about £ 1 a day .
but the proposals have met considerable opposition from parents who have children at the schools in question .
mums at catholic sacred heart primary school in paignton , who are planning to send their children to the combined catholic and anglican cuthbert mayne secondary school in torquay , said removing free school transport would be wrong .
one mother said : " i certainly would n't be able to pay £ 200 for each of my children .
they would have to go somewhere else . "
another parent said : " we want our children to go to a catholic school .
" it is a good school and we believe in the catholic system .
they are going to get that religious side that is n't taught in other schools . "

the district council is amending its charging policy for both long and short-stay car parks .
more than 4,000 people had signed a petition or written letters of protest after the charges rose dramatically to produce an extra £ 600,000 in revenue .
but the council executive has now agreed cuts in parking charges ranging from £ 1.60 to £ 3 .
coastal areas the biggest increase had been for long-stay parking , which had gone up from 70p a day to £ 5.40 , but that has now been reduced in nine long-stay car parks to £ 2.40 for periods longer than three hours .
the committee has decided to continue charging 60p each hour in short-stay car parks , but it has brought in a reduction of £ 1.60 to £ 5.40 for motorists wanting to leave their vehicles parked all day .
parking in busier coastal areas will be limited to three hours .

the district council is amending its charging policy for both long and short-stay car parks .
more than 4,000 people had signed a petition or written letters of protest after the charges rose dramatically to produce an extra £ 600,000 in revenue .

the committee has decided to continue charging 60p each hour in short-stay car parks , but it has brought in a reduction of £ 1.60 to £ 5.40 for motorists wanting to leave their vehicles parked all day .
parking in busier coastal areas will be limited to three hours .
the main level of opposition to the charges had come from honiton , where the chamber of commerce had reported some business was down by 25 % .

the court said mr roh had violated electoral laws , but not gravely enough to remove him from office .
the court 's widely-expected decision means mr roh is immediately reinstated .
the decision is a defeat for conservative politicians , who took a huge gamble when they voted to strip him of his powers in march .
the court announced its verdict live on national television .
it ruled that mr roh had violated his neutrality as president by publicly supporting the liberal uri party , which was formed last october , ahead of last month 's elections .
but it rejected the additional charges against him , of corruption and incompetence .
impeachment bill 's charges : roh " breached election rules " by calling for support for uri party aides " involved in corruption scandals " economy 's poor growth roh comes out on top outside the court , mr roh 's supporters chanted " we got our president back " and " the court decision is a victory for the people " .
a large majority of south koreans opposed the impeachment .
his position had been further strengthened by a victory for the uri party in the parliamentary elections .
the president is not a member of the uri party , but it is made up of reformist legislators loyal to him .
following the elections , he now commands a majority in the national assembly for the first time .
liberal platform the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says the president will return to office in a much stronger position than before .
political analysts say the court 's decision will allow him to press ahead with reforms he was unable to implement in his first year because of resistance in the opposition-dominated parliament .
according to a presidential spokesman , mr roh will address the nation on saturday , and will then promise to pursue his reformist platform .
top of the agenda will be the stagnating economy and relations with the united states .
south korea has so far been dragging its feet over the despatch of 3,000 troops to iraq , our correspondent says .
seoul is also uneasy about washington 's tough policy over north korea 's development of nuclear weapons .
