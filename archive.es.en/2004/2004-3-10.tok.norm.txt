europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

on tuesday , the president of germany 's first division soccer club 1860 munich was arrested on charges of taking bribes from the austrian construction company building the city 's new 280 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- soccer stadium .
the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .
scandal in the stadium the club president and his son , wildmoser junior , and two other men are suspected of pocketing € 2.8 million , or one percent of the overall construction costs of the new stadium which will house wildmoser 's club and germany 's champion bayern munich , said the chief prosecutor in the case , christian schmidt-sommerfeld .
late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .
until the bavarian state criminal investigators and tax office can sort through the case , the bank accounts and real estate investments of both father and son have been frozen .

an army of police and tax officials also searched more than 30 offices and homes in germany , austria and switzerland .
the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .
munich 's two first division soccer clubs are jointly building the stadium , and the german insurer allianz has bought the name rights .

" this is a terrible blow for 1860 and for the whole soccer scene , and for the reputation of munich , " the city 's mayor christian ude said speaking for many in the bavarian capital .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

as attention focuses on conditions for the international taliban prisoners at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , prisoners at the afghan-run shiberghan prison in northern afghanistan are grateful when they see bread. operation in afghanistan .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .

the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .
then , there was no september 11 , 2001 , " ikonomou said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .
in the coming year , the logistics firm 's management plans more of the same , casting its eye towards the lucrative american market . despite € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in losses in part due to the strong euro , 2003 was a good year for deutsche post , according to figures released at a press conference on tuesday .
profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .
stagnation in the domestic market prompted the company to look abroad for new opportunities - with great success .
more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .
in the last few years , deutsche post 's management made key decisions aimed at making the company a global player in the international post , package and logistics market .
with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .
for the fourth year in a row , the company increased dividends .
with globalisation and the increased importance of international trade , deutsche post - with its global distribution network - is well positioned to take advantage of the changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post confident on u.s. expansion deutsche post chief executive klaus zumwinkel has reiterated his intention to make germany ’ s former mail service monopolist a global player by cracking the lucrative u.s. delivery market .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

as attention focuses on conditions for the international taliban prisoners at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , prisoners at the afghan-run shiberghan prison in northern afghanistan are grateful when they see bread. operation in afghanistan .
from the beginning , the bush administration refused to classify the camp detainees as " prisoners of war " , denying them the privileges enjoyed by prisoners under the geneva convention .
washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .

however the good news was tempered by a net loss of € 364 million in the fourth quarter alone as against € 77 million for the same period a year earlier , thanks in part to telekom 's role in the debacle surrounding the toll collect consortium which was meant to install and operate a seven-billion-euro state-of-the-art truck toll scheme for germany 's motorways .
talks between the german government and toll collect broke down last month and the two sides have now agreed to a watered-down version of the ambitious satellite-based system to be put in place by the start of next year .
deutsche telekom , which holds a 45-percent stake in toll collect , had to bear contractual fines for the delay of the project .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .

driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .
in the coming year , the logistics firm 's management plans more of the same , casting its eye towards the lucrative american market . despite € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in losses in part due to the strong euro , 2003 was a good year for deutsche post , according to figures released at a press conference on tuesday .
profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2004 british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floating in legal limbo , a prisoner contemplates his future at guantanamo bay .
five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .
19 , 2002 .
as attention focuses on conditions for the international taliban prisoners at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , prisoners at the afghan-run shiberghan prison in northern afghanistan are grateful when they see bread. operation in afghanistan .
from the beginning , the bush administration refused to classify the camp detainees as " prisoners of war " , denying them the privileges enjoyed by prisoners under the geneva convention .
washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabiye kurnaz , mother of german guantanamo bay detainee murat kurnaz , wipes away tears during a meeting of the guantanamo human rights commission , at the houses of parliament , london , friday march 5 , 2004 .
members of the newly formed commission and families of european terrorist suspects being held at guantanamo bay will travel to the united states next week to lobby president george w. bush for the release of their relatives .
-lrb- ap photo / john d mchugh -rrb- " i 'm very concerned about his well-being , " raibye kurnaz -lrb- photo -rrb- told dw-radio at the washington protest march .
the german government , though lobbying initially on kurnaz 's behalf , has had its hands tied because kurnaz is not a german citizen .
german terrorism officials have said kurnaz headed to pakistan in october 2001 to attend a quran school , but they doubt he was involved in any fighting in afghanistan . docke , kuranz 's lawyer , said he was meeting with u.s. and french lawyers in washington in order to file a suit against the united states on behalf of his client . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break germany -pipe- 10.03.2004 munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena - still waiting for kick off in 2006 the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup . when world cup soccer comes homes to germany in two years , soccer fans around the world will tune into munich 's allianz arena for the kick off of the 2006 games .
but even as the stadium is being built , it 's drawing attention beyond the bavarian city .
on tuesday , the president of germany 's first division soccer club 1860 munich was arrested on charges of taking bribes from the austrian construction company building the city 's new 280 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- soccer stadium .
the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .
scandal in the stadium the club president and his son , wildmoser junior , and two other men are suspected of pocketing € 2.8 million , or one percent of the overall construction costs of the new stadium which will house wildmoser 's club and germany 's champion bayern munich , said the chief prosecutor in the case , christian schmidt-sommerfeld .
late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .
until the bavarian state criminal investigators and tax office can sort through the case , the bank accounts and real estate investments of both father and son have been frozen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz wildmoser speaking through his lawyer on wednesday , wildmoser senior said he would step down from his position at 1860 munich , where he has been president since 1992 .
" he does not want to put a strain on the club he has devoted everything to and will step down from his duties , " steffen ufer announced on behalf of his client world cup venue the arrests of the father and son , who is a manager of the stadium holding company , followed extensive police raids on the club 's offices and homes of the two wildmosers .
an army of police and tax officials also searched more than 30 offices and homes in germany , austria and switzerland .
the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .
munich 's two first division soccer clubs are jointly building the stadium , and the german insurer allianz has bought the name rights .
the 66,000-seat arena is scheduled to be completed in 2005 , well in time for the 2006 world cup in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is underway at the allianz arena in munich the munich stadium will host the opening game of the international competition and one of the semifinals , plus four other world cup matches .
but now , it seems , the scandal has racked up a goal against the stadium and crushed the city 's fans anticipation ahead of the high-profile games .
" this is a terrible blow for 1860 and for the whole soccer scene , and for the reputation of munich , " the city 's mayor christian ude said speaking for many in the bavarian capital .
organizers of the world cup , however , remained confident the scandal in munich would not threaten the completion of the stadium .

spanish diplomats rejected a compromise proposal currently doing the rounds as a " non-starter , " the financial times reported .
the proposal suggests that decisions in the future could be made by 55 percent of member states representing 55 percent of the eu population .
the compromise would mean that a the eu 's biggest countries could not block a decision without the backing of other member states .
but spain maintains that the compromise does not go far enough because it does not allow madrid , as a middle-sized country , to easily form a blocking minority of its own .
spain 's unequivocal answer comes after germany struck a more conciliatory note on the so-called double majority system .
chancellor gerhard schröder said while the principle of double majority should be kept , " we are open to proposals from the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency that are based on this principle , and which would bring movement on this issue . "
talks on the constitution collapsed last december over this very issue , which pitted spain and poland against germany and france .

spanish diplomats rejected a compromise proposal currently doing the rounds as a " non-starter , " the financial times reported .
the proposal suggests that decisions in the future could be made by 55 percent of member states representing 55 percent of the eu population .
the compromise would mean that a the eu 's biggest countries could not block a decision without the backing of other member states .
but spain maintains that the compromise does not go far enough because it does not allow madrid , as a middle-sized country , to easily form a blocking minority of its own .
spain 's unequivocal answer comes after germany struck a more conciliatory note on the so-called double majority system .
chancellor gerhard schröder said while the principle of double majority should be kept , " we are open to proposals from the -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency that are based on this principle , and which would bring movement on this issue . "
talks on the constitution collapsed last december over this very issue , which pitted spain and poland against germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.03.2004 the battle off the pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn hopes not to repeat scenes like this .
wednesday 's champions league match between soccer powerhouse real madrid and germany 's bayern munich is likely to be a timid affair compared to the mudslinging and provocation coming from the spanish and german media . as two of europe 's top clubs , there 's always plenty of emotion involved when real madrid and bayern munich meet on the pitch .
both are the most winning teams in their respective national leagues and both have hoisted the champions league trophy . and when securing a berth in the next round of the world 's most prestigious club tournament is at stake , one might expect the spanish and german sporting press to get fired up .
however , before the first match two weeks ago that was n't the case .
real 's soccer superstars zinedine zidane , ronaldo , luis figo and david beckham were so heavily favored to steamroller the struggling bavarians that even german newspapers feared the worst . then the two sides drew 1-1 in munich in a spirited match and all bets were off . much of the media furore has surrounded madrid player brazilian roberto carlos , who put real 's only goal past bayern keeper oliver kahn .
he was also banned for two matches after retaliating against a kick from martin demichelis with a slap of his own .
since the referee did not see the slap during the game , carlos was not sent off at the time .

according to a report in the berliner zeitung , the christian democrats propose deploying the military to provide order and security in instances where the police can not handle the job alone , for example in the protection of high-profile civil and military targets .
the leaders cite the growing threat of terrorism as the main reason for the change .
however , members of the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens are less than enthusiastic about the idea .
" under no circumstances should internal security be militarized , " said the spd politician dieter wiefelspütz .

eisenman was making reference to the controversy that arose when degussa was hired to provide a protective chemical coating for the memorial .
the comments outraged some , including albert meyer , who heads the board of trustees overseeing the construction of the memorial .
though a date has not yet been set for the meeting , it may take place at the end of may when the architect is in town to meet with the board .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break germany -pipe- 10.03.2004 munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena - still waiting for kick off in 2006 the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup . when world cup soccer comes homes to germany in two years , soccer fans around the world will tune into munich 's allianz arena for the kick off of the 2006 games .
but even as the stadium is being built , it 's drawing attention beyond the bavarian city .
on tuesday , the president of germany 's first division soccer club 1860 munich was arrested on charges of taking bribes from the austrian construction company building the city 's new 280 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- soccer stadium .
the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .
scandal in the stadium the club president and his son , wildmoser junior , and two other men are suspected of pocketing € 2.8 million , or one percent of the overall construction costs of the new stadium which will house wildmoser 's club and germany 's champion bayern munich , said the chief prosecutor in the case , christian schmidt-sommerfeld .
late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .
until the bavarian state criminal investigators and tax office can sort through the case , the bank accounts and real estate investments of both father and son have been frozen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz wildmoser speaking through his lawyer on wednesday , wildmoser senior said he would step down from his position at 1860 munich , where he has been president since 1992 .
" he does not want to put a strain on the club he has devoted everything to and will step down from his duties , " steffen ufer announced on behalf of his client world cup venue the arrests of the father and son , who is a manager of the stadium holding company , followed extensive police raids on the club 's offices and homes of the two wildmosers .
an army of police and tax officials also searched more than 30 offices and homes in germany , austria and switzerland .
the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .
munich 's two first division soccer clubs are jointly building the stadium , and the german insurer allianz has bought the name rights .
the 66,000-seat arena is scheduled to be completed in 2005 , well in time for the 2006 world cup in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is underway at the allianz arena in munich the munich stadium will host the opening game of the international competition and one of the semifinals , plus four other world cup matches .
but now , it seems , the scandal has racked up a goal against the stadium and crushed the city 's fans anticipation ahead of the high-profile games .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

as attention focuses on conditions for the international taliban prisoners at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , prisoners at the afghan-run shiberghan prison in northern afghanistan are grateful when they see bread. operation in afghanistan .
from the beginning , the bush administration refused to classify the camp detainees as " prisoners of war " , denying them the privileges enjoyed by prisoners under the geneva convention .
washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

members of the newly formed commission and families of european terrorist suspects being held at guantanamo bay will travel to the united states next week to lobby president george w. bush for the release of their relatives .
-lrb- ap photo / john d mchugh -rrb- " i 'm very concerned about his well-being , " raibye kurnaz -lrb- photo -rrb- told dw-radio at the washington protest march .
the german government , though lobbying initially on kurnaz 's behalf , has had its hands tied because kurnaz is not a german citizen .
german terrorism officials have said kurnaz headed to pakistan in october 2001 to attend a quran school , but they doubt he was involved in any fighting in afghanistan . docke , kuranz 's lawyer , said he was meeting with u.s. and french lawyers in washington in order to file a suit against the united states on behalf of his client . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .

german terrorism officials have said kurnaz headed to pakistan in october 2001 to attend a quran school , but they doubt he was involved in any fighting in afghanistan . docke , kuranz 's lawyer , said he was meeting with u.s. and french lawyers in washington in order to file a suit against the united states on behalf of his client . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov one of the most significant changes in the latest reshuffle on tuesday announced by putin himself on national television is the appointment of sergei lavrov -lrb- photo -rrb- , moscow 's longtime ambassador to the united nations , as foreign minister .
the 53-year-old lavrov , a career diplomat who led moscow 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq last year and a fluent english speaker , is considered a popular choice . u.n. secretary general kofi annan was quick to congratulate lavrov , saying he had " learnt to appreciate both his wisdom and his wit and considers him a friend " after their years of work together . reshuffle hoped to boost reforms the cabinet revamp , which aims to separate political decision-making from implementation and control , is also believed to curb the influence of top hard-line politicians on security and law enforcement agencies .
" this is the team which after the election will immediately and assuredly take up the job of strengthening the country and improving the quality of life of our citizens , " putin said on television . the president , who also slashed the number of ministers and deputy prime ministers , added that he hoped the reshuffle would make the cabinet more efficient and give a boost to economic reforms .
" this is not to make us all feel bloated with our own importance , but to increase personal responsibility of each minister for his job , " putin said . with popularity rating of up to 80 percent , putin 's reelection is almost considered a foregone conclusion . economic analysts have largely welcomed the cabinet revamp .
" this simply shows that they have chosen the best people , " christopher granville , a strategist with united financial group in london told reuters .
" this is a pretty positive lineup for reform from the point of view of the financial markets . " lots of pluses putin , a former kgb officer , has indeed been credited with turning around russia 's fortunes ever since he took office four years ago , succeeding boris yeltsin . russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- has risen every year since at an annual rate of around 5 percent .
the economy - largely fed by oil exports - has been stable .
inflation has been fairly low , and wages , pensions and foreign debts are largely paid on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushes welcomes the putins to their ranch in crawford putin has also pushed through reforms , key among them a law permitting the sale of farmland for the first time since the czarist era .
he has moved to rein in russia 's unruly regional leaders and wield more control over russia 's powerful business community .
he has also forged close ties with u.s. president bush -lrb- photo -rrb- . flaws and weaknesses but despite his glowing record , putin will have his work cut out upon reelection if he is to show he is serious about keeping russian on the reform path . increasingly accused of an autocratic style , critics question putin 's commitment to democracy given the kremlin 's growing influence .
international observers have blamed his tight control of the media for sweeping wins for the pro-kremlin party in december . " the lack of basic democratic institutions such as political opposition and civic control over the workings of the government makes any administrative reform ineffective , " boris nemtsov , a leader of russia 's weakened liberal political movement told the financial times .
" there is nobody who is able to objectively and openly assess the success or failure of this government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chechen fighter points his rifle to the head of a russian prisoner chechnya -lrb- photo -rrb- also remains a major sticking point with human rights groups who accuse putin of curtailing human rights and reining in critics .
putin 's term has also been plagued by bombings that have killed hundreds outside chechnya .
stifling red tape and widespread corruption also remain major concerns . moscow 's relationship with the eu has been going through a rocky patch , chiefly due to concern that the kremlin might not extend its existing partnership agreement with brussels to include the ten enlargement countries - seven of which were once part of the soviet bloc . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "

washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

german terrorism officials have said kurnaz headed to pakistan in october 2001 to attend a quran school , but they doubt he was involved in any fighting in afghanistan . docke , kuranz 's lawyer , said he was meeting with u.s. and french lawyers in washington in order to file a suit against the united states on behalf of his client . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

as attention focuses on conditions for the international taliban prisoners at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , prisoners at the afghan-run shiberghan prison in northern afghanistan are grateful when they see bread. operation in afghanistan .
from the beginning , the bush administration refused to classify the camp detainees as " prisoners of war " , denying them the privileges enjoyed by prisoners under the geneva convention .
washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

since the referee did not see the slap during the game , carlos was not sent off at the time .
uefa officials imposed the ban only after reviewing the incident after the match . roberto the " poisonous dwarf " although kahn was to blame for letting an easy shot through , germany 's bild newspaper quickly dubbed the small in stature carlos a " poisonous dwarf . "
spanish sportswriter gaspar rosety from the daily " marca " rather tastelessly responded by saying the brazilian was lucky he did n't " get put in the gas chamber . " some members of the spanish press like rosety see a bayern-backed conspiracy to get carlos banned for slapping demichelis .
he blamed munich 's " proletariat management " for seeking success abroad at the uefa headquarters in switzerland since bayern could n't win on their home pitch . not to be outdone , bild has come up with its own conspiracy : real 's injured striker ronaldo is n't really injured and will play on wednesday night as madrid tries psyche out bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , on ground , fails to stop a freekick by real 's brazilian player roberto carlos during the champions league 2nd round 1st leg match between fc bayern munich and real madrid cf in the olympic stadium in munich , southern germany , on tuesday , feb .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .

others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov one of the most significant changes in the latest reshuffle on tuesday announced by putin himself on national television is the appointment of sergei lavrov -lrb- photo -rrb- , moscow 's longtime ambassador to the united nations , as foreign minister .
the 53-year-old lavrov , a career diplomat who led moscow 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq last year and a fluent english speaker , is considered a popular choice . u.n. secretary general kofi annan was quick to congratulate lavrov , saying he had " learnt to appreciate both his wisdom and his wit and considers him a friend " after their years of work together . reshuffle hoped to boost reforms the cabinet revamp , which aims to separate political decision-making from implementation and control , is also believed to curb the influence of top hard-line politicians on security and law enforcement agencies .
" this is the team which after the election will immediately and assuredly take up the job of strengthening the country and improving the quality of life of our citizens , " putin said on television . the president , who also slashed the number of ministers and deputy prime ministers , added that he hoped the reshuffle would make the cabinet more efficient and give a boost to economic reforms .
" this is not to make us all feel bloated with our own importance , but to increase personal responsibility of each minister for his job , " putin said . with popularity rating of up to 80 percent , putin 's reelection is almost considered a foregone conclusion . economic analysts have largely welcomed the cabinet revamp .
" this simply shows that they have chosen the best people , " christopher granville , a strategist with united financial group in london told reuters .
" this is a pretty positive lineup for reform from the point of view of the financial markets . " lots of pluses putin , a former kgb officer , has indeed been credited with turning around russia 's fortunes ever since he took office four years ago , succeeding boris yeltsin . russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- has risen every year since at an annual rate of around 5 percent .
the economy - largely fed by oil exports - has been stable .
inflation has been fairly low , and wages , pensions and foreign debts are largely paid on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushes welcomes the putins to their ranch in crawford putin has also pushed through reforms , key among them a law permitting the sale of farmland for the first time since the czarist era .
he has moved to rein in russia 's unruly regional leaders and wield more control over russia 's powerful business community .
he has also forged close ties with u.s. president bush -lrb- photo -rrb- . flaws and weaknesses but despite his glowing record , putin will have his work cut out upon reelection if he is to show he is serious about keeping russian on the reform path . increasingly accused of an autocratic style , critics question putin 's commitment to democracy given the kremlin 's growing influence .
international observers have blamed his tight control of the media for sweeping wins for the pro-kremlin party in december . " the lack of basic democratic institutions such as political opposition and civic control over the workings of the government makes any administrative reform ineffective , " boris nemtsov , a leader of russia 's weakened liberal political movement told the financial times .
" there is nobody who is able to objectively and openly assess the success or failure of this government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chechen fighter points his rifle to the head of a russian prisoner chechnya -lrb- photo -rrb- also remains a major sticking point with human rights groups who accuse putin of curtailing human rights and reining in critics .
putin 's term has also been plagued by bombings that have killed hundreds outside chechnya .
stifling red tape and widespread corruption also remain major concerns . moscow 's relationship with the eu has been going through a rocky patch , chiefly due to concern that the kremlin might not extend its existing partnership agreement with brussels to include the ten enlargement countries - seven of which were once part of the soviet bloc . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

until now , such a deployment has been constitutionally restricted to cases of national security and natural disaster .
according to a report in the berliner zeitung , the christian democrats propose deploying the military to provide order and security in instances where the police can not handle the job alone , for example in the protection of high-profile civil and military targets .
the leaders cite the growing threat of terrorism as the main reason for the change .
however , members of the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens are less than enthusiastic about the idea .
" under no circumstances should internal security be militarized , " said the spd politician dieter wiefelspütz .
the proposal faces a vote on friday . more briefs 10.03.2004 -pipe- holocaust memorial architect in anti-semitic flap 10.03.2004 -pipe- popularity of christian democrats continues to rise 09.03.2004 -pipe- german soldiers under pressure says report 09.03.2004 -pipe- german woman picked for vatican commission 09.03.2004 -pipe- germany signals compromise on eu voting rights issue 09.03.2004 -pipe- german soccer club president arrested 09.03.2004 -pipe- bavaria to offer elite study courses 08.03.2004 -pipe- army chief rejects proposed cuts radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .
stagnation in the domestic market prompted the company to look abroad for new opportunities - with great success .
more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .
in the last few years , deutsche post 's management made key decisions aimed at making the company a global player in the international post , package and logistics market .
with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "

guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "
" a demonstration of arrogance " the plea is one that has been made in europe virtually since the prison camp 's inception following america 's 2001 military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taliban prisoner wrapped in thin sheets , no name available , looks through the bars at a prison in the town of shiberghan , 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- west of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan , saturday , jan .

from the beginning , the bush administration refused to classify the camp detainees as " prisoners of war " , denying them the privileges enjoyed by prisoners under the geneva convention .
washington reaped a wave of criticism for the stance , also from eu heads-of-state .
guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

the german government , though lobbying initially on kurnaz 's behalf , has had its hands tied because kurnaz is not a german citizen .
german terrorism officials have said kurnaz headed to pakistan in october 2001 to attend a quran school , but they doubt he was involved in any fighting in afghanistan . docke , kuranz 's lawyer , said he was meeting with u.s. and french lawyers in washington in order to file a suit against the united states on behalf of his client . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .

profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .

more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .

with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .
for the fourth year in a row , the company increased dividends .
with globalisation and the increased importance of international trade , deutsche post - with its global distribution network - is well positioned to take advantage of the changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post confident on u.s. expansion deutsche post chief executive klaus zumwinkel has reiterated his intention to make germany ’ s former mail service monopolist a global player by cracking the lucrative u.s. delivery market .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .
then , there was no september 11 , 2001 , " ikonomou said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus .

however the good news was tempered by a net loss of € 364 million in the fourth quarter alone as against € 77 million for the same period a year earlier , thanks in part to telekom 's role in the debacle surrounding the toll collect consortium which was meant to install and operate a seven-billion-euro state-of-the-art truck toll scheme for germany 's motorways .
talks between the german government and toll collect broke down last month and the two sides have now agreed to a watered-down version of the ambitious satellite-based system to be put in place by the start of next year .
deutsche telekom , which holds a 45-percent stake in toll collect , had to bear contractual fines for the delay of the project .
" the toll collect project has created many problems for us .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .
then , there was no september 11 , 2001 , " ikonomou said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break germany -pipe- 10.03.2004 munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena - still waiting for kick off in 2006 the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup . when world cup soccer comes homes to germany in two years , soccer fans around the world will tune into munich 's allianz arena for the kick off of the 2006 games .
but even as the stadium is being built , it 's drawing attention beyond the bavarian city .
on tuesday , the president of germany 's first division soccer club 1860 munich was arrested on charges of taking bribes from the austrian construction company building the city 's new 280 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- soccer stadium .
the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .
scandal in the stadium the club president and his son , wildmoser junior , and two other men are suspected of pocketing € 2.8 million , or one percent of the overall construction costs of the new stadium which will house wildmoser 's club and germany 's champion bayern munich , said the chief prosecutor in the case , christian schmidt-sommerfeld .
late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .
until the bavarian state criminal investigators and tax office can sort through the case , the bank accounts and real estate investments of both father and son have been frozen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz wildmoser speaking through his lawyer on wednesday , wildmoser senior said he would step down from his position at 1860 munich , where he has been president since 1992 .
" he does not want to put a strain on the club he has devoted everything to and will step down from his duties , " steffen ufer announced on behalf of his client world cup venue the arrests of the father and son , who is a manager of the stadium holding company , followed extensive police raids on the club 's offices and homes of the two wildmosers .
an army of police and tax officials also searched more than 30 offices and homes in germany , austria and switzerland .
the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .
munich 's two first division soccer clubs are jointly building the stadium , and the german insurer allianz has bought the name rights .
the 66,000-seat arena is scheduled to be completed in 2005 , well in time for the 2006 world cup in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is underway at the allianz arena in munich the munich stadium will host the opening game of the international competition and one of the semifinals , plus four other world cup matches .
but now , it seems , the scandal has racked up a goal against the stadium and crushed the city 's fans anticipation ahead of the high-profile games .
" this is a terrible blow for 1860 and for the whole soccer scene , and for the reputation of munich , " the city 's mayor christian ude said speaking for many in the bavarian capital .
organizers of the world cup , however , remained confident the scandal in munich would not threaten the completion of the stadium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.03.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc telekom pays dearly for toll system delay german telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on wednesday that it was back in the black , registering a net profit of € 1.253 billion -lrb- $ 1.54 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared with a record € 24.6 billion loss a year earlier .
however the good news was tempered by a net loss of € 364 million in the fourth quarter alone as against € 77 million for the same period a year earlier , thanks in part to telekom 's role in the debacle surrounding the toll collect consortium which was meant to install and operate a seven-billion-euro state-of-the-art truck toll scheme for germany 's motorways .
talks between the german government and toll collect broke down last month and the two sides have now agreed to a watered-down version of the ambitious satellite-based system to be put in place by the start of next year .
deutsche telekom , which holds a 45-percent stake in toll collect , had to bear contractual fines for the delay of the project .
" the toll collect project has created many problems for us .
there 's no doubt about that , " telekom chief kai-uwe ricke said on wednesday . however ricke slashed net debt to € 46.6 billion euros by the end of last year from € 61.1 billion at the end of 2002 . more briefs 09.03.2004 -pipe- international vision for deutsche post 09.03.2004 -pipe- german retailers battle on 09.03.2004 -pipe- fate of bayer division to be decided 09.03.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler admits road toll system mistakes 08.03.2004 -pipe- eads returns to profit 08.03.2004 -pipe- volkswagen denies plans for hiring freeze 08.03.2004 -pipe- heidelberger to sell printing units to kodak 05.03.2004 -pipe- tax cuts leave germans cold 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

however the good news was tempered by a net loss of € 364 million in the fourth quarter alone as against € 77 million for the same period a year earlier , thanks in part to telekom 's role in the debacle surrounding the toll collect consortium which was meant to install and operate a seven-billion-euro state-of-the-art truck toll scheme for germany 's motorways .
talks between the german government and toll collect broke down last month and the two sides have now agreed to a watered-down version of the ambitious satellite-based system to be put in place by the start of next year .
deutsche telekom , which holds a 45-percent stake in toll collect , had to bear contractual fines for the delay of the project .
" the toll collect project has created many problems for us .
there 's no doubt about that , " telekom chief kai-uwe ricke said on wednesday . however ricke slashed net debt to € 46.6 billion euros by the end of last year from € 61.1 billion at the end of 2002 . more briefs 09.03.2004 -pipe- international vision for deutsche post 09.03.2004 -pipe- german retailers battle on 09.03.2004 -pipe- fate of bayer division to be decided 09.03.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler admits road toll system mistakes 08.03.2004 -pipe- eads returns to profit 08.03.2004 -pipe- volkswagen denies plans for hiring freeze 08.03.2004 -pipe- heidelberger to sell printing units to kodak 05.03.2004 -pipe- tax cuts leave germans cold 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .
in the coming year , the logistics firm 's management plans more of the same , casting its eye towards the lucrative american market . despite € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in losses in part due to the strong euro , 2003 was a good year for deutsche post , according to figures released at a press conference on tuesday .
profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .
stagnation in the domestic market prompted the company to look abroad for new opportunities - with great success .
more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .
in the last few years , deutsche post 's management made key decisions aimed at making the company a global player in the international post , package and logistics market .
with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .
for the fourth year in a row , the company increased dividends .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .
then , there was no september 11 , 2001 , " ikonomou said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus .

the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .

late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .

profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .
stagnation in the domestic market prompted the company to look abroad for new opportunities - with great success .
more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .
in the last few years , deutsche post 's management made key decisions aimed at making the company a global player in the international post , package and logistics market .
with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .
for the fourth year in a row , the company increased dividends .
with globalisation and the increased importance of international trade , deutsche post - with its global distribution network - is well positioned to take advantage of the changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post confident on u.s. expansion deutsche post chief executive klaus zumwinkel has reiterated his intention to make germany ’ s former mail service monopolist a global player by cracking the lucrative u.s. delivery market .

but even as the stadium is being built , it 's drawing attention beyond the bavarian city .
on tuesday , the president of germany 's first division soccer club 1860 munich was arrested on charges of taking bribes from the austrian construction company building the city 's new 280 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- soccer stadium .
the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .
scandal in the stadium the club president and his son , wildmoser junior , and two other men are suspected of pocketing € 2.8 million , or one percent of the overall construction costs of the new stadium which will house wildmoser 's club and germany 's champion bayern munich , said the chief prosecutor in the case , christian schmidt-sommerfeld .
late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .
until the bavarian state criminal investigators and tax office can sort through the case , the bank accounts and real estate investments of both father and son have been frozen .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .

" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .
the issue of the olympic games of 2004 can not be compared with any other olympics or with what happened in sydney , atlanta , or munich .
then , there was no september 11 , 2001 , " ikonomou said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : a tough road ahead for greece european editorialists weighed in on the challenges facing greece 's newly-elected government on tuesday , from the upcoming olympic games to the reunification of cyprus .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .
but in its home market , the german company will have to work hard in the next few years to come close to such numbers , said pischetsrieder . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .
" if there is evidence , then they should be charged , " said reinhard docke , kurnaz 's german lawyer who was in washington d.c. to join other protestors on the steps of the u.s. supreme court on tuesday .
" but then in front of a court that adheres to international standards of justice . "

guantanamo " is a demonstration of arrogance that only strengthens the feeling that the u.s. behaves itself however it wants , " swedish prime minister göran persson said last year .
human rights watch , in a report at the beginning of this year , took aim at the legal limbo in which the detainees found themselves .
the bush administration 's ignorance of legal standards , the organization wrote , would undermine " hard fought gains in international law and protections for basic human rights . "
pressure to appease major allies but growing pressure on the administration for its handling of the detainees , more than two years after their capture , and a desire to appease major allies have begun to change washington 's tune .
at the beginning of march , the u.s. handed over seven russian detainees to moscow , the largest transfer since the establishment of the camp .
last fall , the government released three children , between the ages of 13 and 15 , who had been held on the island prison .
though the release of the five british nationals has been welcomed , british organizations continue to pressure for the release of the four remaining u.k. citizens being held at guantanamo .
britain 's home secretary , in washington monday and tuesday , told reporters they would most likely remain there and go before u.s. military tribunals .
no news from the " german taliban " murat kurnaz , who was 19 when he was arrested near the pakistani-afghan border in 2001 , also remains on the island .
the turkish citizen , who was born and raised in the german harbor city bremen has n't been allowed contact with his family for more than a year , said his mother rabiye .

five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp . after months of intense lobbying on both the legal and diplomatic level , the united states released five men held since late 2001 in a heavily controversial prison on guantanamo bay .
the five , who range in age from 20 to 35 , are expected to touch down in london some time tuesday , according to reports .
british prosecutors will then decide if there is any evidence to hold them as suspected terrorists .
legal analysts and rights groups , however , expect their release .
washington 's decision to let the five go comes amid growing public pressure both in the u.s. and abroad to take some sort of action on the more than 600 suspected islamic fundamentalists being held without charge or access to lawyers at the prison camp . among those 600 are an estimated 20 europeans , including the german-born murat kurnaz .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .
" together , united , we 'll do our best to make these olympic games the best and the most secure that have ever taken place , " he said .
" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .
the move is seen in greece as an attempt by karamanlis to cut through some of the bureacracy that has been hindering progress on olympic-related projects .
however , he also risks exposing himself and his new cabinet to criticism should plans not run according to schedule . unprecedented security karamanlis will also be getting a crash-course in the latest international security techniques , as security exercises for the games coincide with his swearing-in on wednesday .
some 400 u.s. military and other personnel will join 2,000 greek officers for the exercises , code named " hercules ' shield . " the drill will be the most comprehensive test of the security network in athens and other greek cities hosting olympic events .
the seriousness of the mock threats will increase throughout the two-week session , culminating in an exercise to test " international cooperation on handling threats of very serious and catastrophic scenarios , " such as a radiation-spreading " dirty bomb , " greek police spokesman col. lefteris ikonomou told the associated press . the olympic security preparations cost more than € 645 million -lrb- $ 800 million -rrb- - more than three times what it cost to safeguard the sydney olympics four years ago .
they include more than 50,000 police and soldiers , 1,400 surveillance cameras , and aerial surveillance .
there will also be a no-fly zone over olympic venues . " we are examining everything at this moment .

following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .
but will the change be good or bad for the country 's troubled preparations ? now that the election euphoria for supporters of greece 's victorious new democracy party has subsided , there 's just one goal : getting everything ready for the start of the olympic games in august . some political observers prophesied a wave of strike action should the center-right party sweep to power after the 11-year rule of the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- .
others predicted a period of chaos while the new government settled in and got down to business . but greece ca n't afford for either of those things to happen , according to greek journalist ambrose santamouris .
" we 're at a point where we have n't got a minute to lose , " he told deutsche welle .
" i think people in both parties have realized this , those who are leaving , as well as those who are taking over . " premier-elect costas karamanlis is optimistic about the challenges facing the new and old governments .

" it 's a good opportunity for greece to show its modern face . " construction behind schedule but from any perspective , the challenges facing greek politicians are daunting .
the country 's olympic preparations have been dogged by delays and fears for security .
construction deadlines are slipping away .
the main concerns are the construction of a glass and steel roof for the central stadium , a covering for the main swimming pool and plans to widen the route of the marathon race . many of the people appointed by the previous socialist government to run projects for the games will likely keep their posts .
" the new democracy wo n't change basic responsibilities - just some of the political responsibilites , " said santamouris .
" but when it comes to organizational and technical projects , the same people will be in charge . " karamanlis has named himself culture minister , meaning he 'll take on responsibility for most of the olympic projects .
he 's placed trusted aides in other top posts for the games .

europe 's biggest carmaker blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .
it plans to slash jobs and introduce a cost-cutting program to counteract the effects . german carmaker volkswagen has run itself aground .
speaking at the company 's annual press conference at the wolfsburg headquarters on tuesday , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder announced , " the first quarter will be miserable in comparison to last year 's . "
citing stagnating sales , the poor german economy and the fall of the dollar against the euro , the ceo outlined new cost-saving measures .
designed to squeeze some four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.96 billion -rrb- in costs by 2005 , the reform program doubles a current savings plan for the same period , and is the largest cost-cutting initiative in vw 's history .
focus on cost efficiency as part of the plan , the company will slash 5,000 of its 337,000 positions , 2,000 to 2,500 of which are in germany .
pischetsrieder said the cuts were aimed at so-called " indirect personnel " and will not effect those employees on the assembly line .
vw will also focus on reducing the workforce by not replacing workers who quit or retire .
pischetsrieder also said the company will examine ways to reduce expenses in the manufacturing processes , by cutting the time for developing a new model , for example .
utilizing more interchangeable parts in the various series , should also lower the costs for developing individual unit pieces without sacrificing the " high quality standards , " the ceo said .
a long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder , ceo volkswagen pischetsrieder , who said the company had " entered a long valley " and would need some time before pulling itself out again , said the cost-cutting initiative was necessary to counteract what was already starting out to be a bad year .
with a drop of 6 percent in unit sales from the same period a year ago , vw looks set to continue last year 's downwards trend in 2004 .
" the markets were very weak at the beginning of the year , particularly in january , " the ceo said .
volkswagen 's earnings have been hit by intense price competition and a weak dollar in the key north american market , as well as a decline in consumer demand in germany , where sales fell for the fourth straight year in 2003 .
" we were not able to meet our goals last year .
one main reason for this is that the economic upturn expected for last year did not take place , " pischetsrieder said .
" we had to accept that - against all forecasts - up to this day the upturn on the most important auto markets has n't begun . "
last year , the company 's net profit fell to € 1.1 billion from € 2.6 billion in 2002 , with sales rising just 0.2 percent to € 87.2 billion .
weak dollar , strong euro the dollar-euro parity has been one of the carmaker 's chief troubles this past year , trimming off profits from sales in the u.s. and outpricing the company 's cars in the competitive north american market .
according to the company , if it had not been for the sharp rise in the euro at the end of 2003 , sales would have been about € 3.5 billion higher .
vw said it would now start moving some production out of the euro zone to avoid the currency crunch .
it aims to build the successor to its lupo compact in brazil and increase production at its puebla , mexico .
light ahead ?
the german carmaker plans on introducing new models aimed at the lower price segment .
the brand skoda , for instance , offers a competitive alternative to more inexpensive asian manufacturers .
starting in 2005 , vw will also roll out a new model for the european market with a price tag significantly under € 10,000 .
by focusing on the lower end , the company hopes to widen its sales base .
in china , the concept is already reaping rewards .
despite steep competition , vw managed to hold on to its 30 percent share in the booming market by selling nearly 700,000 cars in 2003 .

profits reached a record high of € 2.98 billion , while business volume grew 1.9 percent to € 40 billion .
the fact that klaus zumwinkel , the head of deutsche post , had good news for his shareholders was largely due to the company 's ambitious international expansion efforts .
deutsche post - a global player represented in more than 220 countries with more than 383,000 employees , deutsche post has long since outgrown germany 's borders .
stagnation in the domestic market prompted the company to look abroad for new opportunities - with great success .
more than half of last year 's profits came from international ventures .
in the last few years , deutsche post 's management made key decisions aimed at making the company a global player in the international post , package and logistics market .
with the purchase of the u.s.-based company airborne , deutsche post became the third largest provider of express services in the u.s.-market.
and in europe , deutsche post is exploiting opportunities arising from the liberalisation of the postal services market - once characterised by strictly-controlled monopolies - to expand into great britain and the netherlands .
in 2004 , more oversees expansion efforts , particularly in the u.s. , are expected to drive profits up .
" our goal is clear , " klaus zumwinkel told dw-world .
" by 2005 , we want to be the world-wide number one player in logistic services . "
zumwinkel plans to invest € 1 billion over the next three years .
more international expansion ahead a top priority is the u.s.-market , which is among the most liberal in the world .
" we ca n't imagine internationalising our letter services division without expanding into the u.s. , " klaus knappik , the head of letter services at deutsche post , told the financial times germany .
with a yearly business volume of $ 60 billion , the us market represents 30 to 35 percent of the world 's letter business .
also , deutsche post plans to take advantage of the recently privatised markets in austria and denmark and pursue a greater share of the growing asian market .
to achieve the latter , deutsche post is in the process of building an internal transportation network in china , with 290 distribution centers .
diversification and internationalisation has proven a smart business plan for deutsche post , one which has certainly pleased shareholders .
for the fourth year in a row , the company increased dividends .
with globalisation and the increased importance of international trade , deutsche post - with its global distribution network - is well positioned to take advantage of the changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post confident on u.s. expansion deutsche post chief executive klaus zumwinkel has reiterated his intention to make germany ’ s former mail service monopolist a global player by cracking the lucrative u.s. delivery market .

the city 's prosecutor 's office said karl-heinz wildmoser was being held on possible charges of corruption , tax evasion and criminal breach of trust .

late tuesday evening , one of the detainees allegedly made a full confession and was released .
the 64-year old wildmoser and his son , however , remain in police custody .
as of wednesday afternoon , it was n't certain to what extent wildmoser senior was actually involved in the affair .
according to one of the suspects , the younger wildmoser was primarily responsible for taking kickbacks from the austrian construction company alpine , while the club president was largely kept in the dark .

the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .
munich 's two first division soccer clubs are jointly building the stadium , and the german insurer allianz has bought the name rights .

" this is a terrible blow for 1860 and for the whole soccer scene , and for the reputation of munich , " the city 's mayor christian ude said speaking for many in the bavarian capital .

an army of police and tax officials also searched more than 30 offices and homes in germany , austria and switzerland .
the offices of bayern munich were also searched , but prosecutors assured the german champion club was not the target .

organizers of the world cup , however , remained confident the scandal in munich would not threaten the completion of the stadium .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- violence against nhs staff ' rife ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes wednesday , 10 march , 2004 , 06:00 gmt violence against nhs staff ' rife ' one in six nhs staff have faced physical violence , a survey has shown .
the finding was revealed in a commission for health improvement survey of over 200,000 staff from across the nhs .
three quarters of those questioned said they routinely worked longer than their contracted hours .
but despite long hours and the threat of violence , 73 % of those questioned said they were " generally satisfied " with their jobs . "
it can be very difficult to be happy in a workplace where you are at high risk of violent attack " british medical association spokesman staff in primary care , ambulance trusts and hospitals including nurses , doctors , managers and administrative staff completed the survey .
preliminary results showed 37 % had been harassed , bullied or abused at work in the previous 12 months .
most incidents involved patients or their relatives , but a minority of staff said they had been harassed , bullied or abused by a manager or colleague .
a significant number of those who had experienced physical violence had not reported it .
' work / life battle ' the survey also found that a fifth of staff had suffered an injury or illness as a result of moving or handling patients , needlestick or sharps injuries , falls or exposure to dangerous substances .
almost 40 % said they had experienced work-related stress in the previous year .
forty-seven per cent said they had seen at least one error that could have harmed staff or patients in the preceding month .
jocelyn cornwell , acting chief executive of chi , said : " it is concerning that almost one in six staff have experienced physical violence at work .
" although this unfortunate statistic is comparable to other north european health care providers , more needs to be done to ensure staff can go about their work without the fear of being attacked . "
she added : " there is clear evidence of connections between how staff are managed , how they feel about their work and the outcomes for patients .
" more needs to be done to ensure nhs staff are provided with an appropriate work / life balance even though most staff report that they are happy in their jobs .
" it is encouraging to see that the nhs is investing in its staff by providing so many with training and development . "
' tackle bullying ' a spokeswoman for the british medical association said : " doctors are happiest when they are left to do the job they were trained for and that is to use their skills to treat patients .
" however , it can be very difficult to be happy in a workplace where you are at high risk of violent attack , where your work can be dictated by political targets that distort clinical priorities and where you can not introduce initiatives that help patients because of lack of funding . "
a royal college of nursing spokeswoman said more should be done to tackle the problem of bulling and abuse between staff .
she said : " the vast majority of incidents are between patients and staff , or relatives and staff - but there is a significant number of people complaining of bullying from managers or colleagues .
" this is completely unacceptable , and something the nhs must tackle . "
karen jennings , head of health at unison , said : " the results of the survey mirror many of the issues that unison has been campaigning on for years .
" we know the tremendous commitment that nhs staff display , and it simply can not be right that they face a barrage of violence and abuse on an almost day to day basis . "
' crackdown needed ' nhs chief executive sir nigel crisp said : " it is vitally important that our workforce are properly trained , protected and supported so they can give the best possible care to patients . "
he added : " this is what we are working to do .
we have a big increase in staff year on year .

the finding was revealed in a commission for health improvement survey of over 200,000 staff from across the nhs .

preliminary results showed 37 % had been harassed , bullied or abused at work in the previous 12 months .
most incidents involved patients or their relatives , but a minority of staff said they had been harassed , bullied or abused by a manager or colleague .
a significant number of those who had experienced physical violence had not reported it .
' work / life battle ' the survey also found that a fifth of staff had suffered an injury or illness as a result of moving or handling patients , needlestick or sharps injuries , falls or exposure to dangerous substances .
almost 40 % said they had experienced work-related stress in the previous year .
forty-seven per cent said they had seen at least one error that could have harmed staff or patients in the preceding month .

a royal college of nursing spokeswoman said more should be done to tackle the problem of bulling and abuse between staff .
she said : " the vast majority of incidents are between patients and staff , or relatives and staff - but there is a significant number of people complaining of bullying from managers or colleagues .
" this is completely unacceptable , and something the nhs must tackle . "

they are protesting against what they say is a lack of welsh-language provision in universities .
welsh education minister jane davidson said there were not enough courses yet but she wanted to see the number double by the end of the decade .
around 50 students from aberystwyth brought sleeping bags to spend the night near the assembly steps - they were still there on wednesday morning .
' second class citizens ' catrin dafydd , chair of the aberystwyth guild of students said not enough resources were being given to increase the number of welsh-medium courses .

ms davidson said : " i want very much to support students who want to learn in welsh , but for that to happen we need the lecturers to teach them and to develop the resources . "
she pointed to a steering group run through the higher education funding council for wales , which is developing the agenda .
the minister said there also needed to be a proper acknowledgement of the funding already being provided for teaching students through the medium of welsh .
the total teaching grant allocated to the sector for this year is £ 237m .
she said it was disingenuous to claim that only £ 1.6m was being allocated to teaching in welsh - as this was additional to the costs of teaching students .

the call comes as dead mammals continue to be washed up on beaches across the south west .
torbay mp adrian sanders says he can not wait for government trials to be carried out on new nets and wants the current practice banned .
he hopes to put his bill to parliament at the end of the month .
environment effects many of the dolphins deaths are blamed on their becoming caught up in the massive nets strung between two pair trawlers , used to catch bass mainly by french and scottish boats .
as well as the effect on the environment of dead sea mammals , the trawlers are taking thousands of tonnes of sea bass , which is starting to hit sport fishermen who are finding their small catches more difficult to achieve .
in 2003 , 270 dolphins were washed ashore in devon and cornwall .
conservationists estimated that this number was only about 5 % of the total of those which died in nets .
pair trawler crews have always denied they are responsible for the mammals ' deaths .

the call comes as dead mammals continue to be washed up on beaches across the south west .
torbay mp adrian sanders says he can not wait for government trials to be carried out on new nets and wants the current practice banned .
he hopes to put his bill to parliament at the end of the month .
environment effects many of the dolphins deaths are blamed on their becoming caught up in the massive nets strung between two pair trawlers , used to catch bass mainly by french and scottish boats .
as well as the effect on the environment of dead sea mammals , the trawlers are taking thousands of tonnes of sea bass , which is starting to hit sport fishermen who are finding their small catches more difficult to achieve .
in 2003 , 270 dolphins were washed ashore in devon and cornwall .
conservationists estimated that this number was only about 5 % of the total of those which died in nets .
pair trawler crews have always denied they are responsible for the mammals ' deaths .

abdul rashid says the fear prompted the decision to limit campaigning to just seven days - the shortest election period in malaysia 's history .
pm abdullah badawi has offered his own view of islam both government and opposition are focusing on the role of islam in malaysia .
religion has been at the centre of this campaign since leaders of the conservative islamic party , pas , made this election a choice between heaven and hell .
a vote for their opposition party was the mark of a person bound for paradise , they said - a vote for the government that of someone heading to damnation .
malaysia 's prime minister , abdullah badawi , has now contrasted that vision with his own - islam as a religion of development where hard work , hunger for knowledge , science and technology are all encouraged .
fears that the two sides could clash have led the country 's election commission not just to keep the campaign short but also to warn politicians they face arrest if they launch character attacks on opponents .
but an independent watchdog , malaysians for free and fair elections , has asked that the polls be delayed .
it is concerned that the elections could be tainted and says the rushed campaign means there is no chance to check the voting register for fraudulent entries .
it says in a random sample of 3,000 registered voters , almost half could not be traced and one in 10 of the addresses listed appeared not to exist .

the hubble ultra deep field is the result of a prolonged look over four months at just one small patch of sky .
this historic image takes astronomers close to the big bang itself , unveiling the first galaxies that emerged from the end of the so-called " dark ages " .
the image is expected to be unsurpassed until a new telescope is put in orbit .
prolonged exposure to produce the image , hubble peered at the same point in the heavens for periods of many minutes between 24 september 2003 and 16 january 2004 .
click here to see how far back in time hubble has gone in what amounts to a million-second-long exposure , some of the first galaxies that developed after the big bang can be seen .
this was a time in cosmic history when the first stars were reheating a cold , dark universe .
we have seen things that are fainter than anyone has ever seen before steven beckwith , space telescope science institute when the observations ended , steven beckwith , director of the space telescope science institute , told bbc news online : " we have seen things that are fainter than anyone has ever seen before . "
the hubble ultra deep field -lrb- hudf -rrb- contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies .
it is centred on the constellation fornax , next to the constellation orion .
in ground-based images , the patch of sky -lrb- just one-tenth the diameter of the full moon -rrb- is largely empty .
but the hubble image , according to dr beckwith , is " just beautiful - rich , with many different , intriguing things " .
two deep images this historic view is actually a combination of two separate images taken by hubble 's advanced camera for surveys -lrb- acs -rrb- and its near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer -lrb- nicmos -rrb- .
hubble 's longest look took hubble 400 orbits to build ultra deep field observation acs snapped 800 exposures ; each averaged 21 mins long total time amounted to 11.3 days of continuous viewing most distant light detected at rate of 1 photon per minute both images reveal galaxies that are too faint to be seen by ground-based observatories , or even in hubble 's previous faraway looks , called the hubble deep fields -lrb- hdf -rrb- , taken in 1995 and 1998 .
the final acs image is studded with a wide range of galaxies of various sizes , shapes , and colours .
there is also a " zoo " of oddball galaxies littering the field .
a few appear to be interacting .
their strange shapes are different from the spiral and elliptical galaxies we see today .
these unusual galaxies chronicle a period when the universe was more chaotic ; order and structure were just beginning to emerge .
the nicmos sees even farther than the acs .
it reveals the farthest galaxies ever seen , because the expanding universe has stretched their light into the near-infrared portion of the spectrum .
object identification " nicmos provides important additional scientific content to cosmological studies in the hudf , " said rodger thompson , of the university of arizona , and the nicmos principal investigator .
an edge-on spiral galaxy pictured close to an " oddball " blue galaxy the entire hudf also was observed with the advanced camera 's " grism " spectrograph , a hybrid prism and diffraction grating .
" the grism spectra have already yielded the identification of about a thousand objects , " thompson added .
" included among them are some of the intensely faint and red points of light in the acs image , prime candidates for distant galaxies , " said sangeeta malhotra , of the space telescope science institute and the principal investigator for the ultra deep field 's acs grism follow-up study .

the hubble ultra deep field is the result of a prolonged look over four months at just one small patch of sky .
this historic image takes astronomers close to the big bang itself , unveiling the first galaxies that emerged from the end of the so-called " dark ages " .
the image is expected to be unsurpassed until a new telescope is put in orbit .
prolonged exposure to produce the image , hubble peered at the same point in the heavens for periods of many minutes between 24 september 2003 and 16 january 2004 .
click here to see how far back in time hubble has gone in what amounts to a million-second-long exposure , some of the first galaxies that developed after the big bang can be seen .
this was a time in cosmic history when the first stars were reheating a cold , dark universe .
we have seen things that are fainter than anyone has ever seen before steven beckwith , space telescope science institute when the observations ended , steven beckwith , director of the space telescope science institute , told bbc news online : " we have seen things that are fainter than anyone has ever seen before . "
the hubble ultra deep field -lrb- hudf -rrb- contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies .
it is centred on the constellation fornax , next to the constellation orion .
in ground-based images , the patch of sky -lrb- just one-tenth the diameter of the full moon -rrb- is largely empty .
but the hubble image , according to dr beckwith , is " just beautiful - rich , with many different , intriguing things " .
two deep images this historic view is actually a combination of two separate images taken by hubble 's advanced camera for surveys -lrb- acs -rrb- and its near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer -lrb- nicmos -rrb- .
hubble 's longest look took hubble 400 orbits to build ultra deep field observation acs snapped 800 exposures ; each averaged 21 mins long total time amounted to 11.3 days of continuous viewing most distant light detected at rate of 1 photon per minute both images reveal galaxies that are too faint to be seen by ground-based observatories , or even in hubble 's previous faraway looks , called the hubble deep fields -lrb- hdf -rrb- , taken in 1995 and 1998 .
the final acs image is studded with a wide range of galaxies of various sizes , shapes , and colours .
there is also a " zoo " of oddball galaxies littering the field .
a few appear to be interacting .
their strange shapes are different from the spiral and elliptical galaxies we see today .
these unusual galaxies chronicle a period when the universe was more chaotic ; order and structure were just beginning to emerge .
the nicmos sees even farther than the acs .
it reveals the farthest galaxies ever seen , because the expanding universe has stretched their light into the near-infrared portion of the spectrum .
object identification " nicmos provides important additional scientific content to cosmological studies in the hudf , " said rodger thompson , of the university of arizona , and the nicmos principal investigator .
an edge-on spiral galaxy pictured close to an " oddball " blue galaxy the entire hudf also was observed with the advanced camera 's " grism " spectrograph , a hybrid prism and diffraction grating .
" the grism spectra have already yielded the identification of about a thousand objects , " thompson added .

the millburngate shopping centre in durham city , brought in the ban to coincide with " no smoking day " on wednesday .
the centre joins other shopping malls in the north-east of england which have introduced similar restrictions , including the metrocentre in gateshead .
the latest ban follows the recent appointment of a tobacco control manager for the north east .
andy bradley , director of the millburngate centre , said : " we imposed the ban because smoking is becoming less and less socially acceptable .
main objectives " we have seen garments brought back that have been bought from shops here because they smell of smoke .
" at a tenants meeting we had to discuss this , there was 100 % support from the managers of the shops here . "
millburngate joins a growing number of shopping malls which have taken steps to ban smoking .
they include middlesbrough 's cleveland centre and the giant metrocentre complex on tyneside .
earlier this month the north east 's first tobacco control manager was appointed , with one of her main objectives being to work towards a total ban on smoking in public places .
fiona dunlop is based with the public health group north east and her post is funded by the department of health .
