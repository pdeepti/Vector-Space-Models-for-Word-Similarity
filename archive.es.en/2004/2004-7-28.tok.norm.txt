program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

this statement comes just days after britain said it could make 5,000 troops available for sudan , possibly to defend refugee camps in the crisis stricken region of darfur .
up to one million refugees are said to be in the region and reports indicate some 55,000 have already died .
at an eu foreign ministers meeting earlier this week , germany and britain pressed for strong action against the sudanese government to disarm janjaweed militia - accused of raping and murdering thousands .
however with other eu countries , particularly france , arguing for a more staid approach - and iraq and afghanistan firmly in governments ' minds - military intervention remains an option , but a far off one .
many human rights groups and aid agences are urging rapid action and say khartoum is using the arab janjaweed to wipe out anti-government rebel groups and is not fulfilling its promise to dissolve them .
sudanese officials deny this and say they are doing all they can to disarm the groups .

this statement comes just days after britain said it could make 5,000 troops available for sudan , possibly to defend refugee camps in the crisis stricken region of darfur .
up to one million refugees are said to be in the region and reports indicate some 55,000 have already died .
at an eu foreign ministers meeting earlier this week , germany and britain pressed for strong action against the sudanese government to disarm janjaweed militia - accused of raping and murdering thousands .
however with other eu countries , particularly france , arguing for a more staid approach - and iraq and afghanistan firmly in governments ' minds - military intervention remains an option , but a far off one .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .

the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc german beer sales up due to increases in export production , german beer sales for the first half of this year increased while domestic consumption declined for the same period compared to last year .
thanks to a 16.4 percent increase in the amount of german beer destined for other european countries , overall beer sales by volume increased 0.6 percent to 5.18 billion liters -lrb- 1.346 billion gallons -rrb- .
on the home front - which accounts for 87 percent of total production - germans consumed only about 4.5 billion liters , 1.4 percent less than last year .
the domestic beer market has been steadily shrinking since about 1995 .
market observers attribute the decline to a more health-conscious public who is switching to other forms of beverages and a sluggish economy which has resulted in lower consumer spending . more briefs 27.07.2004 -pipe- continued shortfall in german apprenticeships expected 27.07.2004 -pipe- vw reshapes mini-car strategy to boost sales 27.07.2004 -pipe- german business confidence rises in july 26.07.2004 -pipe- german states favor longer opening hours 26.07.2004 -pipe- consumers in germany hit by oil price hike 26.07.2004 -pipe- ex-east german brown coal firm marks 10-year milestone 26.07.2004 -pipe- germany starts first unofficial summer sale 23.07.2004 -pipe- economist : longer workweek risks deflation radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

officials said wednesday holger pfahls , who was state secretary for defense from 1989 to 1992 , would be handed over to germany " immediately " for trial as early as this autumn .
pfahls is suspected of taking nearly two million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- in bribes in connection to the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia and failing to declare the earnings .
the public prosecutor 's office in augsburg believes the 62-year-old pocketed the funds after helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain the contract during the 1991 gulf war .
on the run for five years , pfahls was finally arrested earlier this month in paris . dw-world.de government calls for swift extradition of fallen politician holger pfahls is considered a key figure in the political slush fund scandals of the christian democrats in the 1990s .
following his arrest , new light could be cast on one of germany 's biggest political scandals .

11 attacks in the united states , athens was forced to spend four times more on security than sydney did when it hosted the games in 2000 .
the bill is expected to be much more than the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- now quoted by greek government officials .
multinational tapestry of security biological and chemical weapons detection specialists from the czech republic , a multinational fleet of boats patrolling the greek coastline and around 400 us special forces troops - technically under nato command - will watch over the games .

nato radar planes will patrol the skies above the olympic sites , joining greek police helicopters that are scheduled to fly over athens around the clock .
this week , security officials installed six patriot missile batteries around athens , thessaloniki and the island of skyros .
linking everything together is a complex security system designed by the san diego-based firm science applications international corp. , which created the security network for the winter olympic games in salt lake city in 2002 .
security system not fully operational just weeks before the games are to begin , some experts are concerned that the software running the complex system of surveillance cameras , sensors and intelligence collectors is not fully operational .
the new york times reported last week that the relatively unsophisticated software failed in initial tests in early july .
specialists have also been rushing to install cameras and sensors in olympic sites , many of which were only finished in recent months .
three helicopters , a blimp and close to 300 cameras have begun feeding images into the security network , and company officials remain optimistic that everything will be ready on time .
no such thing as completely safe greek police began moving many of their units into the olympic village on july 1 .
subway stations and much of the olympic complex are already under the watch of the estimated 70,000 greek security personnel designated for the games .
the head of interpol , in a statement issued following a visit in late june , said that the government has made an " unfailing commitment to making these games as safe as possible . "
still , ronald k. noble warned that " the world is a dangerous place , and it is never wise or possible to predict that there is no threat to any event or any public place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .
falcon media has said it will likely increase the number of " fahrenheit 9/11 " prints after the opening weekend , making it available on more screens . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael moore at home in ' old europe ' kicking off his five-city german book tour , author michael moore , part liberal preacher , part comedian , riffed on his standard fare in berlin on sunday .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .

german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .

falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .

his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .

while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .

every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate . experts maintain that the 2004 presidential election in the united states will be a close race . many believe that the votes of us citizens living abroad may be critical to the outcome .
however , in the past only a small proportion of americans living abroad have taken the trouble to vote in elections .
that needs to change this year , say us activists from various organizations in berlin who are campaigning against voter apathy . many us citizens do not exercise their right to vote , especially those who live abroad .
many people , says william downey from “ democrats abroad berlin ” , have not voted in 30 years .
there are up to 20,000 americans living in the german capital alone .
downey and his group are in the process of finding them and mobilizing them for the november vote .
he is convinced that absentee ballots from us citizens living abroad will make a difference . " obviously , we know what happened four years ago in florida where the overseas votes were very important , " downey said in an interview with dw-radio .
" i think it 's always when there is a very close race when the overseas votes can make a difference . " complex voting registration juan diaz , regional director of “ americans overseas for kerry ” in berlin says he sees a great need for coordinating the various groups ’ activities to mobilize potential us voters here .

the us , great britain and israel apparently pushed the hardest for the right to deploy their own security teams , which breaks with olympic tradition .
greek officials have been trying to keep the news from getting out , and the minister of public order continued last week to insist that greek police and soldiers , alone , would carry weapons .
but this week , government officials said that 24 foreign security officers have been allowed to carry guns , according to reports .
they join a multinational team of security experts and soldiers charged with protecting athletes and visitors at the olympic games .
of all the concerns surrounding this year 's summer games , terrorism occupies the top spot .
following the sept .
11 attacks in the united states , athens was forced to spend four times more on security than sydney did when it hosted the games in 2000 .
the bill is expected to be much more than the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- now quoted by greek government officials .
multinational tapestry of security biological and chemical weapons detection specialists from the czech republic , a multinational fleet of boats patrolling the greek coastline and around 400 us special forces troops - technically under nato command - will watch over the games .

nato radar planes will patrol the skies above the olympic sites , joining greek police helicopters that are scheduled to fly over athens around the clock .
this week , security officials installed six patriot missile batteries around athens , thessaloniki and the island of skyros .
linking everything together is a complex security system designed by the san diego-based firm science applications international corp. , which created the security network for the winter olympic games in salt lake city in 2002 .
security system not fully operational just weeks before the games are to begin , some experts are concerned that the software running the complex system of surveillance cameras , sensors and intelligence collectors is not fully operational .
the new york times reported last week that the relatively unsophisticated software failed in initial tests in early july .
specialists have also been rushing to install cameras and sensors in olympic sites , many of which were only finished in recent months .
three helicopters , a blimp and close to 300 cameras have begun feeding images into the security network , and company officials remain optimistic that everything will be ready on time .
no such thing as completely safe greek police began moving many of their units into the olympic village on july 1 .
subway stations and much of the olympic complex are already under the watch of the estimated 70,000 greek security personnel designated for the games .
the head of interpol , in a statement issued following a visit in late june , said that the government has made an " unfailing commitment to making these games as safe as possible . "
still , ronald k. noble warned that " the world is a dangerous place , and it is never wise or possible to predict that there is no threat to any event or any public place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2004 ukraine sends mixed signals on new defense doctrine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kutschma heading west or east ?
an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes . " the 35 hours have killed growth since 2000 , " raffarin said , adding that his government would make the fight against job flight a top priority in 2005 .
he hopes to reduce france 's unemployment rate of 9.8 percent , which lies 0.8 percent above the euro zone 's rate . but raffarin is not the only one willing to take on the issue .
french president jacques chirac also said this month that workers should be able to spend more than 35 hours on the job each week . finance minister nicolas sarkozy , rumored to be a possible successor to chirac , has suggested giving tax exemptions to companies that move jobs to poor areas of the country . german company starts the trend in france while german companies siemens and daimlerchrysler have already hammered out controversial deals with workers , including longer workweeks , another german company has already begun doing the same in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a bosch plant in mid-july , workers at a bosch car parts factory near lyon agreed to work 36 hours per week in return for the company 's promise not to move jobs to the czech republic .
the deal has saved 190 of 300 jobs bosch was planning to scrap , according to news reports . others , including nexans , europe 's biggest cable maker , have said that they may ask workers to accept longer workweeks as well , according to reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .
the firm 's top managers will contribute to the savings by giving up part of their salaries .
-lrb- july 23 , 2004 -rrb- outsourcing made in germany using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

the threat of moving jobs elsewhere has become an increasingly powerful weapon for industry at the negotiating table .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .
he has been living in the united states since ending his playing career in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klins the man for 2006 world cup jürgen klinsmann put pen to paper on a two-year contract on monday and became germany 's new national coach , ending one of the most embarrassing episodes in german soccer history .

every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate . experts maintain that the 2004 presidential election in the united states will be a close race . many believe that the votes of us citizens living abroad may be critical to the outcome .

many people , says william downey from “ democrats abroad berlin ” , have not voted in 30 years .
there are up to 20,000 americans living in the german capital alone .
downey and his group are in the process of finding them and mobilizing them for the november vote .
he is convinced that absentee ballots from us citizens living abroad will make a difference . " obviously , we know what happened four years ago in florida where the overseas votes were very important , " downey said in an interview with dw-radio .

" if it turns out that kerry carries on with these policies then we might be , at some point , against him . " the different action groups representing americans living in berlin are hoping that many us citizens living here will show up at cinemas on thursday when michael moore ’ s fahrenheit 9/11 premieres in germany .

every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate . experts maintain that the 2004 presidential election in the united states will be a close race . many believe that the votes of us citizens living abroad may be critical to the outcome .
however , in the past only a small proportion of americans living abroad have taken the trouble to vote in elections .
that needs to change this year , say us activists from various organizations in berlin who are campaigning against voter apathy . many us citizens do not exercise their right to vote , especially those who live abroad .
many people , says william downey from “ democrats abroad berlin ” , have not voted in 30 years .
there are up to 20,000 americans living in the german capital alone .
downey and his group are in the process of finding them and mobilizing them for the november vote .
he is convinced that absentee ballots from us citizens living abroad will make a difference . " obviously , we know what happened four years ago in florida where the overseas votes were very important , " downey said in an interview with dw-radio .
" i think it 's always when there is a very close race when the overseas votes can make a difference . " complex voting registration juan diaz , regional director of “ americans overseas for kerry ” in berlin says he sees a great need for coordinating the various groups ’ activities to mobilize potential us voters here .
he knows that many americans living abroad have not taken parts in ballots because of the complexities of voter registration . his organization and many others are now offering help to expatriate voters in filling in absentee ballot applications and sending them to the right address in the us .
this is not as easy as it sounds because as yet there is no single central office for their applications . " in my group there are democrats , there are independents , there are young people who have never voted and have registered for the first time , " said diaz .
" we want to reach as many people as possible and just give them the chance to vote . " unprecedented presidential election elsa rassbach of “ american voices abroad get out and vote action ” argues that the 2004 presidential election is unlike any other .
she maintains that the time ’ s ripe for a new president . " we are against the policy of preventive or pre-emptive war which bush introduced , in our opinion .
we are against the patriot act which cuts into our traditional civil rights so we are against bush on principle , " rassbach explained .
" if it turns out that kerry carries on with these policies then we might be , at some point , against him . " the different action groups representing americans living in berlin are hoping that many us citizens living here will show up at cinemas on thursday when michael moore ’ s fahrenheit 9/11 premieres in germany .
they see this as a good opportunity to get in touch with absent voters and ask them to make use of their right to vote this time around . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .
-lrb- february 5 , 2004 -rrb- democrats abroad mobilize against bush through expat primaries the last u.s. election saw george bush win partly due to large numbers of republican absentee ballots .
this year , democrats have swiftly mobilized members abroad to help determine the party 's presidential candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2004 ukraine sends mixed signals on new defense doctrine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kutschma heading west or east ?
an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .
he has been living in the united states since ending his playing career in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klins the man for 2006 world cup jürgen klinsmann put pen to paper on a two-year contract on monday and became germany 's new national coach , ending one of the most embarrassing episodes in german soccer history .

the us , great britain and israel apparently pushed the hardest for the right to deploy their own security teams , which breaks with olympic tradition .
greek officials have been trying to keep the news from getting out , and the minister of public order continued last week to insist that greek police and soldiers , alone , would carry weapons .
but this week , government officials said that 24 foreign security officers have been allowed to carry guns , according to reports .
they join a multinational team of security experts and soldiers charged with protecting athletes and visitors at the olympic games .
of all the concerns surrounding this year 's summer games , terrorism occupies the top spot .
following the sept .
11 attacks in the united states , athens was forced to spend four times more on security than sydney did when it hosted the games in 2000 .
the bill is expected to be much more than the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- now quoted by greek government officials .
multinational tapestry of security biological and chemical weapons detection specialists from the czech republic , a multinational fleet of boats patrolling the greek coastline and around 400 us special forces troops - technically under nato command - will watch over the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us-swiss airship is fitted with cameras and sensors to help provide security at the athens olympics .
nato radar planes will patrol the skies above the olympic sites , joining greek police helicopters that are scheduled to fly over athens around the clock .
this week , security officials installed six patriot missile batteries around athens , thessaloniki and the island of skyros .
linking everything together is a complex security system designed by the san diego-based firm science applications international corp. , which created the security network for the winter olympic games in salt lake city in 2002 .
security system not fully operational just weeks before the games are to begin , some experts are concerned that the software running the complex system of surveillance cameras , sensors and intelligence collectors is not fully operational .
the new york times reported last week that the relatively unsophisticated software failed in initial tests in early july .
specialists have also been rushing to install cameras and sensors in olympic sites , many of which were only finished in recent months .
three helicopters , a blimp and close to 300 cameras have begun feeding images into the security network , and company officials remain optimistic that everything will be ready on time .
no such thing as completely safe greek police began moving many of their units into the olympic village on july 1 .
subway stations and much of the olympic complex are already under the watch of the estimated 70,000 greek security personnel designated for the games .
the head of interpol , in a statement issued following a visit in late june , said that the government has made an " unfailing commitment to making these games as safe as possible . "

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2004 ukraine sends mixed signals on new defense doctrine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kutschma heading west or east ?
an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .

true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .
falcon media has said it will likely increase the number of " fahrenheit 9/11 " prints after the opening weekend , making it available on more screens . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael moore at home in ' old europe ' kicking off his five-city german book tour , author michael moore , part liberal preacher , part comedian , riffed on his standard fare in berlin on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .

falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .

" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

the us , great britain and israel apparently pushed the hardest for the right to deploy their own security teams , which breaks with olympic tradition .
greek officials have been trying to keep the news from getting out , and the minister of public order continued last week to insist that greek police and soldiers , alone , would carry weapons .
but this week , government officials said that 24 foreign security officers have been allowed to carry guns , according to reports .
they join a multinational team of security experts and soldiers charged with protecting athletes and visitors at the olympic games .
of all the concerns surrounding this year 's summer games , terrorism occupies the top spot .
following the sept .
11 attacks in the united states , athens was forced to spend four times more on security than sydney did when it hosted the games in 2000 .
the bill is expected to be much more than the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- now quoted by greek government officials .
multinational tapestry of security biological and chemical weapons detection specialists from the czech republic , a multinational fleet of boats patrolling the greek coastline and around 400 us special forces troops - technically under nato command - will watch over the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us-swiss airship is fitted with cameras and sensors to help provide security at the athens olympics .
nato radar planes will patrol the skies above the olympic sites , joining greek police helicopters that are scheduled to fly over athens around the clock .
this week , security officials installed six patriot missile batteries around athens , thessaloniki and the island of skyros .
linking everything together is a complex security system designed by the san diego-based firm science applications international corp. , which created the security network for the winter olympic games in salt lake city in 2002 .
security system not fully operational just weeks before the games are to begin , some experts are concerned that the software running the complex system of surveillance cameras , sensors and intelligence collectors is not fully operational .
the new york times reported last week that the relatively unsophisticated software failed in initial tests in early july .
specialists have also been rushing to install cameras and sensors in olympic sites , many of which were only finished in recent months .
three helicopters , a blimp and close to 300 cameras have begun feeding images into the security network , and company officials remain optimistic that everything will be ready on time .
no such thing as completely safe greek police began moving many of their units into the olympic village on july 1 .
subway stations and much of the olympic complex are already under the watch of the estimated 70,000 greek security personnel designated for the games .
the head of interpol , in a statement issued following a visit in late june , said that the government has made an " unfailing commitment to making these games as safe as possible . "
still , ronald k. noble warned that " the world is a dangerous place , and it is never wise or possible to predict that there is no threat to any event or any public place .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .
falcon media has said it will likely increase the number of " fahrenheit 9/11 " prints after the opening weekend , making it available on more screens . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael moore at home in ' old europe ' kicking off his five-city german book tour , author michael moore , part liberal preacher , part comedian , riffed on his standard fare in berlin on sunday .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .
he has been living in the united states since ending his playing career in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klins the man for 2006 world cup jürgen klinsmann put pen to paper on a two-year contract on monday and became germany 's new national coach , ending one of the most embarrassing episodes in german soccer history .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .

" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .

take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .

they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .
falcon media has said it will likely increase the number of " fahrenheit 9/11 " prints after the opening weekend , making it available on more screens . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael moore at home in ' old europe ' kicking off his five-city german book tour , author michael moore , part liberal preacher , part comedian , riffed on his standard fare in berlin on sunday .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .

officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate . experts maintain that the 2004 presidential election in the united states will be a close race . many believe that the votes of us citizens living abroad may be critical to the outcome .

many people , says william downey from “ democrats abroad berlin ” , have not voted in 30 years .
there are up to 20,000 americans living in the german capital alone .
downey and his group are in the process of finding them and mobilizing them for the november vote .

we are against the patriot act which cuts into our traditional civil rights so we are against bush on principle , " rassbach explained .
" if it turns out that kerry carries on with these policies then we might be , at some point , against him . " the different action groups representing americans living in berlin are hoping that many us citizens living here will show up at cinemas on thursday when michael moore ’ s fahrenheit 9/11 premieres in germany .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes . " the 35 hours have killed growth since 2000 , " raffarin said , adding that his government would make the fight against job flight a top priority in 2005 .
he hopes to reduce france 's unemployment rate of 9.8 percent , which lies 0.8 percent above the euro zone 's rate . but raffarin is not the only one willing to take on the issue .
french president jacques chirac also said this month that workers should be able to spend more than 35 hours on the job each week . finance minister nicolas sarkozy , rumored to be a possible successor to chirac , has suggested giving tax exemptions to companies that move jobs to poor areas of the country . german company starts the trend in france while german companies siemens and daimlerchrysler have already hammered out controversial deals with workers , including longer workweeks , another german company has already begun doing the same in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a bosch plant in mid-july , workers at a bosch car parts factory near lyon agreed to work 36 hours per week in return for the company 's promise not to move jobs to the czech republic .
the deal has saved 190 of 300 jobs bosch was planning to scrap , according to news reports . others , including nexans , europe 's biggest cable maker , have said that they may ask workers to accept longer workweeks as well , according to reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .
he has been living in the united states since ending his playing career in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klins the man for 2006 world cup jürgen klinsmann put pen to paper on a two-year contract on monday and became germany 's new national coach , ending one of the most embarrassing episodes in german soccer history .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes . " the 35 hours have killed growth since 2000 , " raffarin said , adding that his government would make the fight against job flight a top priority in 2005 .
he hopes to reduce france 's unemployment rate of 9.8 percent , which lies 0.8 percent above the euro zone 's rate . but raffarin is not the only one willing to take on the issue .
french president jacques chirac also said this month that workers should be able to spend more than 35 hours on the job each week . finance minister nicolas sarkozy , rumored to be a possible successor to chirac , has suggested giving tax exemptions to companies that move jobs to poor areas of the country . german company starts the trend in france while german companies siemens and daimlerchrysler have already hammered out controversial deals with workers , including longer workweeks , another german company has already begun doing the same in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a bosch plant in mid-july , workers at a bosch car parts factory near lyon agreed to work 36 hours per week in return for the company 's promise not to move jobs to the czech republic .
the deal has saved 190 of 300 jobs bosch was planning to scrap , according to news reports . others , including nexans , europe 's biggest cable maker , have said that they may ask workers to accept longer workweeks as well , according to reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .

german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .

falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .

his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks .

last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .

the man who was lined up to steer the german national soccer team from behind jürgen klinsmann 's public facade has decided not to work with the new head coach . just when it looked like everything was signed and sealed and the shame consigned to the annals of history , the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- took another blow on wednesday when veteran coach holger osieck opted out of the klinsmann revolution .
the man targeted as the experienced , guiding hand behind new head coach jürgen klinsmann 's public face announced that he will not join the german national side as an assistant , shattering the dfb 's plan to bring in osieck as the new coach 's number two .
deal collapses at the last klinsmann and osieck , who was franz beckenbauer 's deputy during germany 's 1990 world cup-winning campaign , failed to reach an agreement over a collaboration , the dfb said in a statement .
it is a shock that may increase the continuing woe in the dfb corridors of power .
both the governing body and its new coach believed the deal on the partnership to be finalized .
in what has become an almost standard phrase over the past month , the dfb announced that a final decision on the new leadership of the national team would be made on thursday .
new coaching team now lacks experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unclear how the 55-year-old osieck 's decision will change the set-up .
klinsmann has signed a two-year contract after agreeing to coach germany until after the 2006 world cup on home soil , replacing former strike partner rudi völler , and has been joined in inking the page by another ex-international attacker oliver bierhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- who takes on the role as team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
neither have any coaching experience and the dfb will be looking to appoint a tried and tested man with international credentials to steer the newcomers from the stern .
a former germany striker and captain , klinsmann , 39 , scored 47 goals from 108 internationals and lifted the world cup in 1990 .
he has been living in the united states since ending his playing career in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klins the man for 2006 world cup jürgen klinsmann put pen to paper on a two-year contract on monday and became germany 's new national coach , ending one of the most embarrassing episodes in german soccer history .

negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .

an online decree posted by the ukrainian government indicates it has removed the targets of eu and nato membership from its defense doctrine .
officials in kiev , however , say integration is still an aim . confusion surrounds ukraine 's apparent decision to remove eu and nato membership as strategic aims in the country 's defense doctrine . a posting on the ukrainian government 's website on july 26 quoted a decree by ukrainian president leonid kutschma which replaced eu and nato membership in ukraine 's defense doctrine with the more vague aim of " euro-atlantic integration . "
the decree substituted a new goal of " deepening " kiev 's relations with the blocs for its earlier goal of " joining " them .
however , ukraine 's deputy foreign minister oleh shamshur told a press conference in kiev the following day that ukraine had not changed its policy toward nato and the eu despite the rewording carried in the president 's latest decree and that kiev was still pursuing what he called " euro integration . "
integration still a goal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we do not see any reasons for claims that ukraine has changed its european and euro-atlantic course , since the ultimate goal of european integration has not changed , is not changing , and i do n't think it will change .
the key word about european integration is still there , " shamshur told reporters .
in june , kutschma signed a defense doctrine that stated kiev was " pursuing a policy of euro-atlantic integration with a final goal of joining nato as the basis of the european security system . "
the new decree which appeared on the government website , signed and dated july 15 , read : " ukraine 's national security interests require the deepening of relations with nato and the eu as guarantors of security and stability in europe . "
it remains unclear whether kiev will now seek a formal change of wording to its june defense doctrine .
the english-language daily the moscow times reported on tuesday that changing the doctrine would require parliamentary approval .
eu chooses measured response regardless of whether the doctrine has or has not changed , the european union had a reserved reaction to the reports .
some observers see kutschma 's apparent decision to give up eu and nato membership as strategic objectives as a result of getting the cold-shoulder by brussels .
commenting on relations with both ukraine and russia , chief european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen told a press conference on tuesday that the eu seeks closer ties with ukraine , but is not offering membership . " insofar as our relationship with ukraine and russia is concerned , we have good and close relations with both countries , and we hope they will be even closer in the future .
membership of the european union has never been in the offing for either of those countries , nor has it formally been discussed as a prospect , " kemppinen said .
kutschma bluffing ? ukraine has been pursuing eu membership for some time but as yet to receive any positive response on the matter from brussels .
kutschma feels he has also been shunned by nato despite pledging his support to the war in iraq , something a number of european union countries refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , and leonid kutschma .
with presidential elections approaching in ukraine , a change in doctrine which moves away from the pursuit of western recognition may help kutschma attract support from russia , an important factor in winning pro-moscow votes in the former soviet country . it appears that the ukrainian president is hedging his bets ; not fully departing from the target of eu and nato membership in case of a change of heart in brussels , while distancing himself enough to attract pro-russian voters .
he also chose to release his ambiguous decree during the visit of russian president vladimir putin . reiner lindner , an expert on eastern europe from the university of konstanz , explained to dw-radio that votes from the pro-russian east will be very important for kutschma as he looks to install a successor who can protect his interests . " at the moment , it is a matter of finding a successor who can take over -lrb- kutschma 's -rrb- position and represent his interests .
and this must be a nominee who is chosen , above all , by the people of east ukraine .
that man is viktor juschtschenko , the head of the government .
opposition nominees will mobilize strong votes in western or central ukraine .
so the possible change in military doctrine could be based in electoral tactics .

" we need to increase productivity and stay competitive to prevent companies from moving abroad . " statements like this one have become common among german politicians , who worry that the country 's high labor costs will push firms to shift production elsewhere . in france , political leaders until recently criticized the push by german companies to introduce longer workweeks as " pretty horrible blackmailing , " adding that the french government would not let company executives threaten workers to either accept the changes or face losing their job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin now , french premier jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has joined the chorus : during a speech before france 's parliament , the conservative politician said the 35-hour workweek - introduced by a previous socialist government - was to blame for the country 's economic woes .

the group said that the positions would be cut in tk steel by sept .
2007 as part of a plan to reduce costs by 200-250 million euros -lrb- $ 242-302 million -rrb- per year .
at the end of last year tk steel employed about 50,000 people in germany .

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .
the independents may get some relief next week .
falcon media has said it will likely increase the number of " fahrenheit 9/11 " prints after the opening weekend , making it available on more screens . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael moore at home in ' old europe ' kicking off his five-city german book tour , author michael moore , part liberal preacher , part comedian , riffed on his standard fare in berlin on sunday .

german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .
though the military intervention in afghanistan was accepted as a reaction to the events of sept .
11 , the iraq war was seen here as a brutal adventure of american imperialism . "
schröder noted that bush 's popularity ratings in germany have never risen above the 30 percent mark .
moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "
and most blame bush for that atmosphere .
against that backdrop , it 's not surprising that the demand for " fahrenheit 9/11 " in germany is outstripping the number of copies available to theaters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one fahrenheit 9/11 scene , moore tries to get members of the us congress to sign their kids up to fight in the war in iraq .
in this still , moore -lrb- left -rrb- is seen with rep. john tanner , a tennessee democrat .
" we could show this film in every one of our theaters , " said arne schmidt , spokesman for the hamburg-based cinemaxx .
" but we 're only showing it in 20 to 25 theaters this week because of the lack of prints .
the interest in this film is relatively large . "
the multiplex theater chain , with 34 theaters and 343 screens , is germany 's largest , according to the company .
cinemaxx expects well over a million viewers to see fahrenheit .
true stories are the new addiction in addition to bush bashing , which has become a favorite national pastime here , " fahrenheit " also arrives at a time when documentary films are enjoying growing popularity in germany - a trend that began with wim wender 's " buena vista social club " , a 1999 film that portrayed a group of legendary cuban musicians who had fallen on hard times .
films that were once relegated to repertory cinemas and art house theaters are now the fodder of 3,000 seat megaplexes with stadium seating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four years old and ' lovin it . "
" super size me " offered a critical view of the nutritional standards set by multinational fast food giant mcdonalds .
" german audiences have discovered that ' true stories ' can be both entertaining and educational , " said eva matlock , executive manager of ag kino , germany 's association of independent cinemas , explaining the explosive growth of documentary audiences here .
take for example morgan spurlock 's " super size me " , a low-budget film that slyly makes mince-meat of fast food goliath mcdonalds and is currently the no. 7 film at the german box office .
cinemaxx 's schmidt said that in times of economic malaise in germany , moviegoers ' tastes have changed .
while demand for blockbuster entertainment flicks like " spiderman ii " or " shrek ii " is still huge , people are also looking for fare that tells them a little bit more about the world around them .
" people have been staying home because of the economic crisis , " he said .
" they have n't been going to restaurants and not very often to the movies .
they 're watching a lot of television and they 're much more aware of what 's going on around them .
and this creates a new interest -lrb- in documentary films -rrb- .
they 're starting to go back to the theater , but they 've become addicted to a new kind of entertainment . "
from the art house to the multiplex ironically , the newfound popularity of documentary films is making it harder for the independent cinemas - once the only outlets brave enough to take the financial risk of showing them - to get copies .
" it 's great that documentary films have become socially acceptable , " explained matlock , whose firm represents 304 member theaters with a total of 539 screens .
but that also means that with a film like " fahrenheit 9/11 " , multiplexes and other large city cinemas will often be given first dibs on prints .
" it 's becoming much harder for smaller theaters , " she said .

moore 's attacks against bush , schröder explained , play into the deep-seated discomfort many germans have for the american president .
in the eyes of many germans , schröder said , " the transatlantic relationship has deteriorated into a hopelessly one-sided institution .
the white house expects everything and there is no bargaining . "

11 michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " opens in berlin on wednesday .
german film and movie theater executives expect it to break moore 's own record for the most-shown documentary ever in the country . it has racked up more than $ 100 million in box office sales in the united states .
it has broken records in britain and france .
and most expect michael moore 's " fahrenheit 9/11 " to fare the same in germany when it premieres in berlin this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a movie poster for fahrenheit 9/11 " germans likes the way he presents politics and his sense of humor , and people see his as the ' other voice of america , ' a counterweight to us president george w. bush , " said andreas fallscheer , managing director of falcom media group , the company that is distributing the film in germany .
falcom has distributed 220 prints for wednesday 's opening , the greatest number ever in germany for a documentary film .
" we expect the film to have the same kind of success here that it has had in the us , france and england , " he said .
the moore phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore has been setting off political bombs with his documentaries for two decades in the past two years , germans disenchanted with bush and the current state of transatlantic relations have thronged to moore 's -lrb- photo -rrb- controversial body of work .
his first bush diatribe , " stupid white men , " sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german - comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
and more than a million germans turned out to see his oscar-winning indictment against us gun laws , " bowling for columbine " .
during his most recent book tour , germans gave him rock start treatment as he gave readings in standing room only concert halls .
" moore 's popularity in germany is due to a combination of his anti-bush position and the current problems in german-american relations , " said hans-jürgen schröder , professor of contemporary history at the university of giessen .
" bush does n't have good standing here because many hold him responsible for straining the transatlantic alliance , " schröder said .
" germans are n't used to some elements of the american foreign policy of unilateralism .

every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate . experts maintain that the 2004 presidential election in the united states will be a close race . many believe that the votes of us citizens living abroad may be critical to the outcome .
however , in the past only a small proportion of americans living abroad have taken the trouble to vote in elections .
that needs to change this year , say us activists from various organizations in berlin who are campaigning against voter apathy . many us citizens do not exercise their right to vote , especially those who live abroad .
many people , says william downey from “ democrats abroad berlin ” , have not voted in 30 years .
there are up to 20,000 americans living in the german capital alone .
downey and his group are in the process of finding them and mobilizing them for the november vote .
he is convinced that absentee ballots from us citizens living abroad will make a difference . " obviously , we know what happened four years ago in florida where the overseas votes were very important , " downey said in an interview with dw-radio .

he knows that many americans living abroad have not taken parts in ballots because of the complexities of voter registration . his organization and many others are now offering help to expatriate voters in filling in absentee ballot applications and sending them to the right address in the us .
this is not as easy as it sounds because as yet there is no single central office for their applications . " in my group there are democrats , there are independents , there are young people who have never voted and have registered for the first time , " said diaz .

she maintains that the time ’ s ripe for a new president . " we are against the policy of preventive or pre-emptive war which bush introduced , in our opinion .
we are against the patriot act which cuts into our traditional civil rights so we are against bush on principle , " rassbach explained .
" if it turns out that kerry carries on with these policies then we might be , at some point , against him . " the different action groups representing americans living in berlin are hoping that many us citizens living here will show up at cinemas on thursday when michael moore ’ s fahrenheit 9/11 premieres in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.07.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran senior diplomats from the three countries are planning to meet iranian officials in london this week in an attempt to revive talks between the two sides , according to the washington post .
negotiations stalled last month after iran said it would resume making equipment that could be used in a nuclear bomb .
despite reports that iran is close to getting the materials for a nuclear bomb , europe 's big three are still committed to resuming the talks . " discussions are ongoing , we still firmly believe that this is the right way to achieve our goal , " said a spokesman for the foreign office in london , according to reuters .
last october , iran had promised to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment , a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons , and allow snap inspections of its nuclear facilities .
however , following a rebuke in june by the eu for not co-operating fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , iran said it would resume the manufacture and assembly of uranium enrichment centrifuges .
tehran is allowed to make centrifuges and other parts for peaceful nuclear energy - but centrifuges can also be used to purify uranium to make it usable as fuel for weapons .

the northampton- based company promised a voucher for a free mobile phone at orange shops if customers spent £ 15 or more on its skincare products .
but the firm ran out of phones , and offered half price skin cream to those customers who missed out .
the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- upheld 27 complaints over a brochure advertising the promotion .
the asa said avon had based its estimates for demand on a promotion involving a free gift but of a much smaller value .
it had also continued to promote the mobile phone voucher offer , despite knowing that it was unable to meet demand .
the authority told the promoters to " take more care when administering future promotions " .
an avon spokeswoman said four out of five customers expecting a voucher for a mobile phone had received one , but it was " truly sorry " about the fact that some had not .
" we have learned a great deal from this promotion and have examined all our processes , " she said .

the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals -lrb- rspca -rrb- is calling for tighter laws to prevent more cases .
statistics released on wednesday show that , in the past year , the rspca carried out 49 prosecutions in wales and rescued more than 450 animals .
dogs and puppies are most at risk , followed by farm animals .
earlier this month , the uk government announced plans for the biggest change in animal cruelty laws in wales and england for nearly a century .
the current law dates back to 1911 .
the rspca hopes a new animal welfare bill will introduce a duty of care for pet owners and farmers to maintain minimum standards .
the society says it has seen numerous serious cases in wales the past year .
south wales inspector rohan barker was called to dreonen , pontyberem , llanelli , and found the emaciated carcass of charlie , a white boxer dog .
the dog was still attached to a tether with a choker type chain .
when the owner was taken to court , a magistrate described the incident was as the worst example of animal cruelty he had ever witnessed .
bethan mair ross pleaded guilty to neglect .
she received a life ban on the keeping of any animal , a fine of £ 500 and a further £ 300 costs .
when the dog was found , all his major bones were visible through the skin , and when weighed , he was 16.2kg - way below the normal weight of around 28kg .
" the sight of this young dog lying in the back yard was horrifying and will live with me for ever , " inspector barker said .
" there is no excuse for allowing an animal to starve to death .
the immense suffering this animal endured is heartbreaking . "
the rspca re-homes thousands of animals each year inspector christine mcneil was shocked when she was called to a house in porth , rhondda , and found star , a young saluki , severely underweight .
a vet said the normal weight of a young saluki should be about 19kg , but star weighed just 7.4kg.
the dog had been starved over a long period of time .
as well as being dehydrated and anaemic , she had a murmur on both heart valves .
michael jarman and gaynor mitchell pleaded guilty at pontypridd magistrates court in february 2003 to causing unnecessary suffering , and both were banned for keeping any animal for 10 years .
ms mitchell was fined £ 100 , mr jarman was ordered to pay costs of £ 250 and to complete 100-hours community punishment order .
fortunately , after two months in the care of the rspca , he condition had improved considerably and she had regained weight .
" she was without doubt the thinnest dog i have ever seen , " inspector mcneill said .

the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals -lrb- rspca -rrb- is calling for tighter laws to prevent more cases .
statistics released on wednesday show that , in the past year , the rspca carried out 49 prosecutions in wales and rescued more than 450 animals .
dogs and puppies are most at risk , followed by farm animals .
earlier this month , the uk government announced plans for the biggest change in animal cruelty laws in wales and england for nearly a century .
the current law dates back to 1911 .
the rspca hopes a new animal welfare bill will introduce a duty of care for pet owners and farmers to maintain minimum standards .
the society says it has seen numerous serious cases in wales the past year .
south wales inspector rohan barker was called to dreonen , pontyberem , llanelli , and found the emaciated carcass of charlie , a white boxer dog .
the dog was still attached to a tether with a choker type chain .
when the owner was taken to court , a magistrate described the incident was as the worst example of animal cruelty he had ever witnessed .
bethan mair ross pleaded guilty to neglect .
she received a life ban on the keeping of any animal , a fine of £ 500 and a further £ 300 costs .
when the dog was found , all his major bones were visible through the skin , and when weighed , he was 16.2kg - way below the normal weight of around 28kg .
" the sight of this young dog lying in the back yard was horrifying and will live with me for ever , " inspector barker said .
" there is no excuse for allowing an animal to starve to death .
the immense suffering this animal endured is heartbreaking . "
the rspca re-homes thousands of animals each year inspector christine mcneil was shocked when she was called to a house in porth , rhondda , and found star , a young saluki , severely underweight .
a vet said the normal weight of a young saluki should be about 19kg , but star weighed just 7.4kg.
the dog had been starved over a long period of time .
as well as being dehydrated and anaemic , she had a murmur on both heart valves .
michael jarman and gaynor mitchell pleaded guilty at pontypridd magistrates court in february 2003 to causing unnecessary suffering , and both were banned for keeping any animal for 10 years .
ms mitchell was fined £ 100 , mr jarman was ordered to pay costs of £ 250 and to complete 100-hours community punishment order .
fortunately , after two months in the care of the rspca , he condition had improved considerably and she had regained weight .
" she was without doubt the thinnest dog i have ever seen , " inspector mcneill said .
" to see her now you would n't know it was the same animal . "

the junction of victoria and albert street had to be dug up because of fears the road could collapse .
workmen uncovered the bridge , which crosses the markeaton brook , in june after the road started to subside .
the area has proved to be a tourist attraction and there have been calls for the council to leave it open , despite disruption to city traffic .
flooding problem " i hope they do n't fill it in completely ... but cover it over so people can still see some of it , " local historian derek palmer said .
" a bridge was first built at this location in 1540 , but this one definitely dates from at least 1787 , " he said .
the location of the problem means public transport has had to be diverted .
the council has been granted more than £ 200,000 by the government so they can work on the hole .
on tuesday the city council met to discuss whether it should be filled in and concreted over and have appointed a contractor to carry out the repair work .
