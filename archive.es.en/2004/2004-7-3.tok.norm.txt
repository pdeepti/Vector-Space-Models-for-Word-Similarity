even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .
it ’ s only a pity the german team can ’ t be there to see it . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece in final after sensational victory over czechs greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .

organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .

" everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .

england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .

even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .

even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .
hooliganism , the bane of tournaments both in europe and on the world stage in the past , made only small appearances at european championships . nothing compared to past tournaments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese riot police officers face english soccer fans the most severe incidents took place in the algarve region in the south of portugal , where thousands of fans set up camp in the resort town of albufeira .
riot police and mounted officers clashed with hundreds of fans on june 14 , many of them english , arresting 33 people .
england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .
some fans think they do n't have any other option . " these have become national showpieces , " said desmond mccabe , who was visiting his third soccer tournament with his family .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .

england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .

" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves .

" jan is better prepared than we expected him , better prepared than other years . " after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , the german has been runner-up a whopping five times .

" it 's very difficult to win .
there 're many , many things that could happen .
i could just flat-out lose the race to a better rider .
so i prefer to face it one day at a time . " armstrong said he would not be distracted by the controversy surrounding a new book by david walsh and pierre ballester that alleges he has doped in the past .

" it 's going to be the hardest tour yet , " the five-time champion from texas said , naming ullrich as his greatest rival .
" jan is better prepared than we expected him , better prepared than other years . " after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , the german has been runner-up a whopping five times .

" but i 'm not riding the tour to be second again , it 's to be first . " along with the armstrong and ullrich , american tyler hamilton , spaniard iban mayo and italian ivan basso are the other main contenders for the yellow jersey .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .

england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves .

those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .

even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .

defending tour de france champion lance armstrong will attempt a record sixth win when the world 's greatest cycling event starts on saturday .
can german star jan ullrich or another contender end his reign ? us postal team leader armstrong remains the favourite to win the tour when he saddles up for this saturday 's prologue , but the 32-year-old said there were plenty of other cyclists who could dethrone him this year . " it 's going to be the hardest tour yet , " the five-time champion from texas said , naming ullrich as his greatest rival .
" jan is better prepared than we expected him , better prepared than other years . " after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , the german has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . " being runner-up last year was a good result , i could have won but i made mistakes , " said ullrich .
" but i 'm not riding the tour to be second again , it 's to be first . " along with the armstrong and ullrich , american tyler hamilton , spaniard iban mayo and italian ivan basso are the other main contenders for the yellow jersey .
many of armstrong 's contemporaries have taken heart after seeing the usually dominant texan struggle to win last year . " last year 's race made all of the overall contenders a little more confident and lots of people are licking their lips and ready to attack , " hamilton said according to the reuters news agency . going for legend no rider has every managed to win the tour de france six times .
if armstrong manages it this time , he would move ahead of other legendary five-time winners like eddy merckx and miguel indurain . the three-week-long contest will start in the belgian city of liege and will wind 3,390 kilometers -lrb- 2,100 miles -rrb- throughout france , ending in paris on july 25 .
with challenging time trials and gruelling days in the alps ahead of him , armstrong said he was taking nothing for granted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong in paris just before winning the 2003 tour de france " it 's not a one-day race , " he said .
" it 's very difficult to win .
there 're many , many things that could happen .
i could just flat-out lose the race to a better rider .
so i prefer to face it one day at a time . " armstrong said he would not be distracted by the controversy surrounding a new book by david walsh and pierre ballester that alleges he has doped in the past .
" la confidential , the secrets of lance armstrong " does not present proof of the charges , but it has statements from armstrong 's masseuse emma o 'reilly . " extraordinary accusations must be followed with extraordinary proof and mr walsh and mr ballester have worked four or five years and they have not come up with extraordinary proof , " amstrong told the associated press . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .

i could just flat-out lose the race to a better rider .
so i prefer to face it one day at a time . " armstrong said he would not be distracted by the controversy surrounding a new book by david walsh and pierre ballester that alleges he has doped in the past .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .

england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .

even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .
it ’ s only a pity the german team can ’ t be there to see it . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece in final after sensational victory over czechs greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .
hooliganism , the bane of tournaments both in europe and on the world stage in the past , made only small appearances at european championships . nothing compared to past tournaments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese riot police officers face english soccer fans the most severe incidents took place in the algarve region in the south of portugal , where thousands of fans set up camp in the resort town of albufeira .
riot police and mounted officers clashed with hundreds of fans on june 14 , many of them english , arresting 33 people .
england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .

" everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .

england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .

those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .
hooliganism , the bane of tournaments both in europe and on the world stage in the past , made only small appearances at european championships . nothing compared to past tournaments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese riot police officers face english soccer fans the most severe incidents took place in the algarve region in the south of portugal , where thousands of fans set up camp in the resort town of albufeira .
riot police and mounted officers clashed with hundreds of fans on june 14 , many of them english , arresting 33 people .
england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .
some fans think they do n't have any other option . " these have become national showpieces , " said desmond mccabe , who was visiting his third soccer tournament with his family .
" they ca n't afford to get it wrong .

even though the german team is out of the european championships , there ’ s still plenty keeping the germans interested .
perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .
so , one way and another , with a german referee , a german trainer and even a german ball , sunday will be a major day in german soccer history .
it ’ s only a pity the german team can ’ t be there to see it . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece in final after sensational victory over czechs greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night .

perhaps that ’ s because they think the greeks , who are in the final , are really a german team . as the greeks won the match against the czech republic on thursday , the german television commentator johannes b. kerner couldn ’ t stop himself : one man had made it possible , he said .
this man : otto rehhagel . in the tabloid paper , the express , the headline was “ otto in the final . ”
yes , the germans seem to believe that the dramatic greek victory was really all down to the team ’ s trainer , otto rehhagel , a veteran of german soccer . so , aside from the night-time honking of the horns as the many greek communities celebrated their victory with a lap of honor around the streets of german cities , germans also felt a glow of satisfaction . otto rehhagel had made it ; as he said at one point : “ i found a team where everybody did what they wanted , and i turned them into a team where everybody does what they ’ re good at . ” so the final on sunday , when greece meets portugal , has a strong german interest .
will rehhagel beat the portuguese ? that ’ s what the germans want to know . a german referee , a german ball bildunterschrift : markus merk there are other german angles — the referee of sunday ’ s game , markus merk -lrb- photo -rrb- , is a dentist from the southwestern german town of kaiserslautern .
some portuguese media have already complained that “ otto rehhagel ’ s team ” will have an advantage as a result . in his inaugural speech on thursday , horst köhler , the new german president , pointed out that although the new seam-free soccer balls used at the championship might be made in asia , they were a high-tech product designed in germany , and that was good for german jobs . and , following the resignation of rudi völler as german trainer and the decision by ottmar hitzfeld not to take on the job , otto rehhagel ’ s name is being mentioned as a possible successor .
it was scarcely polite , but the interviewer asked him before even the sweat was dry after the game , whether he ’ d be interested in the job . come on , he said , it ’ s only a couple of minutes after the end of the game ; i ’ m the trainer here , my team has a right that i concentrate wholly on them .
which didn ’ t mean no to the top job in german soccer , of course .
but somehow the man ought to be allowed to finish this job before he starts on the next . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's shooting star cristiano ronaldo with the german-designed ball .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .
hooliganism , the bane of tournaments both in europe and on the world stage in the past , made only small appearances at european championships . nothing compared to past tournaments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese riot police officers face english soccer fans the most severe incidents took place in the algarve region in the south of portugal , where thousands of fans set up camp in the resort town of albufeira .
riot police and mounted officers clashed with hundreds of fans on june 14 , many of them english , arresting 33 people .
england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .
some fans think they do n't have any other option . " these have become national showpieces , " said desmond mccabe , who was visiting his third soccer tournament with his family .

soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons . after a promising tournament , the english national team lost a heartbreaking quarterfinal match last week in lisbon on a penalty shootout .
organizers were braced for the worst .
english fans , by far the biggest group to attend the three-week european soccer championships in portugal , already had a hand in rioting that led to injuries and arrests in the south of the country during the first week of the tournament .
now , police feared a bigger outbreak of hooliganism following the loss that eliminated the team from the tournament . instead , fans on both sides shook hands and exchanged compliments .
on the streets of lisbon , euphoric portuguese , flags wrapped around their waists , consoled sullen english fans , their faces still painted with st. george 's crosses . " everybody wants to be a winner , but in this game there are also losers , " said steve collins , who had driven 34 hours from manchester with his son just to see the game .
" you have to be gallant when you lose . " the sentiment is evidence of what analysts say is a new fan culture to emerge from the tournament in portugal .
hooliganism , the bane of tournaments both in europe and on the world stage in the past , made only small appearances at european championships . nothing compared to past tournaments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese riot police officers face english soccer fans the most severe incidents took place in the algarve region in the south of portugal , where thousands of fans set up camp in the resort town of albufeira .
riot police and mounted officers clashed with hundreds of fans on june 14 , many of them english , arresting 33 people .
england supporter gary mann , 46 , was sentenced to two years in a portuguese jail for inciting a riot , but english officials said he will not have to serve his term . the interior ministry deported more than 64 fans , including 41 english and five german citizens , according to official figures .
the five were in a group involved in a melee with dutch fans ahead of germany 's game against holland in porto on june 15 . " if we compare them to the previous tournament -lrb- in belgium and the netherlands -rrb- , i thought the numbers of arrests for public disorders would be relatively higher , " said paolo gomes , the deputy head of the committee responsible for tournament security , in a dw-world interview .
" there is already talk of a new fan culture in europe … where people are concentrating on the soccer itself , on living the moment , on enjoying themselves . " leaning on the advice of experts gomes said that the interior ministry did place a high priority on keeping hooligans from disturbing the tournament .
better cooperation with police forces from the countries participating in this year 's championships provided officials with comprehensive lists of violence-prone fans . bildunterschrift : portuguese police practiced rioting control in simulations leading up to the tournament . many were n't allowed to travel to portugal in the first place .
those that did were caught at the border and sent home . law enforcement specialists from each of the participating countries also joined their counterparts in portugal to keep an eye on violence-prone fans .
english officers trained in containing fan rioting helped train portuguese police . " we should not forget that we have gathered relevant experience -lrb- at club tournaments -rrb- in recent years , " gomes said . fans complain of police brutality some fans , however , said the portuguese police were a little too aggressive in stopping potential troublemaking . english fans told reporters that the situation in albufeira only got out of hand because police officers were jittery .
paul donahue , who was among those deported , told the bbc that he suffered broken ribs and other injuries from police brutality even though he was n't doing anything wrong .
" we just feel like we 've been made scapegoats , " donahue told the bbc . portuguese police deny they did anything wrong and that they will stick to the methods they have employed throughout the tournament .
some fans think they do n't have any other option . " these have become national showpieces , " said desmond mccabe , who was visiting his third soccer tournament with his family .

defending tour de france champion lance armstrong will attempt a record sixth win when the world 's greatest cycling event starts on saturday .
can german star jan ullrich or another contender end his reign ? us postal team leader armstrong remains the favourite to win the tour when he saddles up for this saturday 's prologue , but the 32-year-old said there were plenty of other cyclists who could dethrone him this year . " it 's going to be the hardest tour yet , " the five-time champion from texas said , naming ullrich as his greatest rival .
" jan is better prepared than we expected him , better prepared than other years . " after wining the tour de france himself in 1997 , the german has been runner-up a whopping five times .
three of those second places came behind a victory by armstrong , who beat him in 2003 by just 61 seconds . " being runner-up last year was a good result , i could have won but i made mistakes , " said ullrich .

the petitions are the first to be filed since a us supreme court ruling earlier this week said they could challenge their detention in us courts .
the center for constitutional rights , which is part of the legal action , says the petitions concern nine detainees out of nearly 600 still at guantanamo .
the petitions say the detention is illegal and demand the men 's release .
the detainees named include two britons , moazzem begg from birmingham and feroz abbasi from croydon in london , three french citizens and a turk , two arabs from jordan and iraq and a canadian .
the petitions come hours after the bush administration said it might release some of the prisoners .
bbc pentagon correspondent nick childs says it is increasingly clear that the administration was caught off-guard by monday 's ruling .
pentagon review by a margin of six to three , the court decided that the nearly 600 prisoners being held at guantanamo bay did have a legal right to challenge their captivity .
the ruling passes no judgement on the guilt or innocence of those being held .
moazzem begg 's father azmat welcomed the news , saying he was very worried about his son 's wellbeing after two-and-a-half years in detention .
he said : " he should be medically and physically examined and if he has done anything wrong , all right , take him to the court .
" if he has not done anything wrong , he should be released .
i do not know why they are keeping him there .
" he must be immediately released and our government should take full useful force to take him back rather than delay it . "
the pentagon spokesman noted that the us has already been setting up an annual review process for the nearly 600 prisoners being held at the us naval base on cuba .
under the system - due to begin soon - a panel of three military officers will carry-out case-by-case reviews to determine whether prisoners no longer pose a security threat and can be released .
the pentagon has already released more than 130 prisoners .
but the reviews have been criticised by campaigners because the prisoners will continue to be refused access to lawyers .
the supreme court ruling is being seen as the biggest legal setback to president george w bush since his war on terrorism began following the 11 september 2001 attacks .
detainees from 40 countries are currently being held at the cuba base .
most of them were captured in afghanistan in late 2001 during the us-led invasion to oust the taleban regime .
many have spent more than two years in captivity without being charged .

following a private tour of the south lanarkshire centre , mr blunkett said the uk government did not treat the detention of families lightly .
mr blunkett also praised the " dedicated and caring staff " at the former prison .
he said : " i made a commitment that i would visit dungavel removal centre and see it for myself . "
" i have done that today and i am satisfied that the conditions there are entirely satisfactory .
" i would also like to praise the dedicated and caring staff who do a good job under difficult circumstances . "
we do regrettably have to detain some families with children , usually just prior to their removal from the uk david blunkett mr blunkett said the detention of families was regrettable but necessary in order to run an efficient immigration system .
families were held at dungavel for an average of 11 days and there had been three children at the centre during his visit , he went on .
" the vast majority of the detainees in dungavel are adults who are awaiting removal , " he said .
" but , in order to maintain an effective immigration system , on occasions we do regrettably also have to detain some families with children , usually just prior to their removal from the uk .
" we do not detain families lightly and in the uk , families are on average detained at present for less than 11 days .
" when i visited dungavel on friday there were just three children in detention . "
' safe , caring environment ' mr blunkett also said there was " a considerable amount " of inspection at the centre , citing visits by the local independent monitoring board and immigration minister des browne .
the chief inspector for prisons , anne owers , the children 's commissioner for scotland , kathleen marshall , and members of the home affairs select committee , had also toured the centre , he added .
mr blunkett said ms owers had found dungavel to be " a safe , caring and respectful environment for detainees " in a report following her inspection .
i ca n't believe for one minute he -lsb- mr blunkett -rsb- has any understanding of what really goes on there rosie kane msp however scottish socialist msp rosie kane , a known critic of the centre , said : " as much as i welcome a visit by david blunkett to dungavel , i ca n't believe for one minute he has any understanding of what really goes on there .
" he needs to come with me on my visits and help mop up the tears from the terrified people locked up there who do n't have any legal representation .
" he needs to speak to the hungry , distressed children there who are refused food out of hours and have to watch their mother 's be taken to hospital in handcuffs . "
another long-standing critic of dungavel , glasgow-based human rights lawyer , aamer anwar , claimed mr blunkett was guilty of human rights abuses .
mr anwar said : " i think it 's an absolute disgrace , he has no compassion or humanity .
" to say there 's no problem with locking up men , women and children behind barbed wire who have committed no crime in what is supposedly a democratic country is an outrage .
" he is guilty of human rights abuses and the fact that he had to slip in to dungavel on the quiet because he knows there would be mass outcry and demonstrations if he made a public visit is a damning indictment of this labour government 's immigration policies . "

he said : " i made a commitment that i would visit dungavel removal centre and see it for myself . "
" i have done that today and i am satisfied that the conditions there are entirely satisfactory .
" i would also like to praise the dedicated and caring staff who do a good job under difficult circumstances . "
we do regrettably have to detain some families with children , usually just prior to their removal from the uk david blunkett mr blunkett said the detention of families was regrettable but necessary in order to run an efficient immigration system .
families were held at dungavel for an average of 11 days and there had been three children at the centre during his visit , he went on .
" the vast majority of the detainees in dungavel are adults who are awaiting removal , " he said .
" but , in order to maintain an effective immigration system , on occasions we do regrettably also have to detain some families with children , usually just prior to their removal from the uk .
" we do not detain families lightly and in the uk , families are on average detained at present for less than 11 days .
" when i visited dungavel on friday there were just three children in detention . "
' safe , caring environment ' mr blunkett also said there was " a considerable amount " of inspection at the centre , citing visits by the local independent monitoring board and immigration minister des browne .
the chief inspector for prisons , anne owers , the children 's commissioner for scotland , kathleen marshall , and members of the home affairs select committee , had also toured the centre , he added .
mr blunkett said ms owers had found dungavel to be " a safe , caring and respectful environment for detainees " in a report following her inspection .
i ca n't believe for one minute he -lsb- mr blunkett -rsb- has any understanding of what really goes on there rosie kane msp however scottish socialist msp rosie kane , a known critic of the centre , said : " as much as i welcome a visit by david blunkett to dungavel , i ca n't believe for one minute he has any understanding of what really goes on there .
" he needs to come with me on my visits and help mop up the tears from the terrified people locked up there who do n't have any legal representation .
" he needs to speak to the hungry , distressed children there who are refused food out of hours and have to watch their mother 's be taken to hospital in handcuffs . "
another long-standing critic of dungavel , glasgow-based human rights lawyer , aamer anwar , claimed mr blunkett was guilty of human rights abuses .
mr anwar said : " i think it 's an absolute disgrace , he has no compassion or humanity .
" to say there 's no problem with locking up men , women and children behind barbed wire who have committed no crime in what is supposedly a democratic country is an outrage .
" he is guilty of human rights abuses and the fact that he had to slip in to dungavel on the quiet because he knows there would be mass outcry and demonstrations if he made a public visit is a damning indictment of this labour government 's immigration policies . "

the appeal of driving recklessly endures driving and shooting have long been popular themes in video games , but what exactly is the appeal of these particular activities ?
martin edmondson , founder of reflections interactive software and creator of the driver games , thinks he knows .
he reckons one of the reasons is that they " allow you to recreate some of the classic movie moments from famous car chases , in an environment where you wo n't lose your licence .
" allowing the player to get out of the car and change to another vehicle is a natural extension of this . "

in some ways , it could seem as if edmonson is trying to hybridise gaming and movies .
" in many ways yes , and this came as a result of driver 's original inspiration , which is the car chase movies of the 70s - bullitt , the french connection , the driver and so on , " he says .
" the kind of people who play games these days are exactly the same people who are buying dvd films . "
film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been ...
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment martin edmondson , reflections interactive software discuss this story on bbc collective they expect more and more from games , and crave the same kind of production values they get in dvds , he thinks .
" games have previously been quite amateurish in their narrative or story-related visuals , but this is gradually changing , " edmondson continues .
" we have more professional scriptwriters , musicians , actors and even professional directors and editors becoming involved .
" years ago these tasks would be given to a programmer or artist in the studio with very mixed results , " he says .
but are games developers really so unsophisticated ?
do they really need to turn to a very different medium to " learn about production values and story-telling " ?
it is debatable : doubtless , there is a conflict of interests in the results when combining playing with viewing .
" it 's certainly true that the game provides breaks in the story-telling , " says edmondson .
" it 's also likely that you will only play a game for a few hours and not return to it until later - something that never happens when watching a film . "
it is a tricky balance , he says , but gamers have to accept that they are very different to films and that much of the flow of the experience has to be decided by the player .
" film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been .
they can see the crossover too , " says edmondson .
" ridley scott associates were genuinely keen and enthusiastic to become involved .
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment . "
which is all well and good , but it also smacks of that all-consuming monster , franchise culture , wherein standards are compromised in the name of creating a cross-medium brand that bulldozes its way into the consciousness .
losing the will personally , i have not played a game that has made me lose the will to live as rapidly as driver3 for a long while .

frankly , the on-foot controls are poor , the driving is unforgiving and the graphics involve hideous amounts of pop-up .
driver3 could have been so much better , but i suspect reflections got intoxicated by their filmmaking aspirations and the actual playability got overlooked .
i do not really care about a game with a flashy cast , nifty " camera " angles and a " film director " function when it is no fun to actually play .

the appeal of driving recklessly endures driving and shooting have long been popular themes in video games , but what exactly is the appeal of these particular activities ?
martin edmondson , founder of reflections interactive software and creator of the driver games , thinks he knows .
he reckons one of the reasons is that they " allow you to recreate some of the classic movie moments from famous car chases , in an environment where you wo n't lose your licence .
" allowing the player to get out of the car and change to another vehicle is a natural extension of this . "
high expectations the mention of movies is telling .
driv3r - driv-three-er ? - for example , seems very much to be a game with movie aspirations , with its reliance on narrative , its cut scenes and its voice cast -lrb- michael madsen , ving rhames -rrb- .
in some ways , it could seem as if edmonson is trying to hybridise gaming and movies .
" in many ways yes , and this came as a result of driver 's original inspiration , which is the car chase movies of the 70s - bullitt , the french connection , the driver and so on , " he says .
" the kind of people who play games these days are exactly the same people who are buying dvd films . "
film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been ...
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment martin edmondson , reflections interactive software discuss this story on bbc collective they expect more and more from games , and crave the same kind of production values they get in dvds , he thinks .
" games have previously been quite amateurish in their narrative or story-related visuals , but this is gradually changing , " edmondson continues .
" we have more professional scriptwriters , musicians , actors and even professional directors and editors becoming involved .
" years ago these tasks would be given to a programmer or artist in the studio with very mixed results , " he says .
but are games developers really so unsophisticated ?
do they really need to turn to a very different medium to " learn about production values and story-telling " ?
it is debatable : doubtless , there is a conflict of interests in the results when combining playing with viewing .
" it 's certainly true that the game provides breaks in the story-telling , " says edmondson .
" it 's also likely that you will only play a game for a few hours and not return to it until later - something that never happens when watching a film . "
it is a tricky balance , he says , but gamers have to accept that they are very different to films and that much of the flow of the experience has to be decided by the player .
" film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been .
they can see the crossover too , " says edmondson .
" ridley scott associates were genuinely keen and enthusiastic to become involved .
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment . "
which is all well and good , but it also smacks of that all-consuming monster , franchise culture , wherein standards are compromised in the name of creating a cross-medium brand that bulldozes its way into the consciousness .
losing the will personally , i have not played a game that has made me lose the will to live as rapidly as driver3 for a long while .
i do not have a problem , like some games commentators , with narrative-heavy games .
but i do have a problem with games that promise so much and fail so roundly .
watching its opening cut scenes , i was intrigued .
but then i started actually playing the thing .
frankly , the on-foot controls are poor , the driving is unforgiving and the graphics involve hideous amounts of pop-up .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- when games collide with movie makers bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 3 july , 2004 , 08:30 gmt 09:30 uk when games collide with movie makers what happens when the film industry gets more interested in video games , asks daniel etherington of bbc collective in his weekly games column .
driving and shooting have long been popular themes in video games , but what exactly is the appeal of these particular activities ?
martin edmondson , founder of reflections interactive software and creator of the driver games , thinks he knows .
he reckons one of the reasons is that they " allow you to recreate some of the classic movie moments from famous car chases , in an environment where you wo n't lose your licence .
" allowing the player to get out of the car and change to another vehicle is a natural extension of this . "
high expectations the mention of movies is telling .
driv3r - driv-three-er ? - for example , seems very much to be a game with movie aspirations , with its reliance on narrative , its cut scenes and its voice cast -lrb- michael madsen , ving rhames -rrb- .
in some ways , it could seem as if edmonson is trying to hybridise gaming and movies .
" in many ways yes , and this came as a result of driver 's original inspiration , which is the car chase movies of the 70s - bullitt , the french connection , the driver and so on , " he says .
" the kind of people who play games these days are exactly the same people who are buying dvd films . "
" film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been ...
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment " martin edmondson , reflections interactive software they expect more and more from games , and crave the same kind of production values they get in dvds , he thinks .
" games have previously been quite amateurish in their narrative or story-related visuals , but this is gradually changing , " edmondson continues .
" we have more professional scriptwriters , musicians , actors and even professional directors and editors becoming involved .
" years ago these tasks would be given to a programmer or artist in the studio with very mixed results , " he says .
but are games developers really so unsophisticated ?
do they really need to turn to a very different medium to " learn about production values and story-telling " ?
it is debatable : doubtless , there is a conflict of interests in the results when combining playing with viewing .
" it 's certainly true that the game provides breaks in the story-telling , " says edmondson .
" it 's also likely that you will only play a game for a few hours and not return to it until later - something that never happens when watching a film . "
it is a tricky balance , he says , but gamers have to accept that they are very different to films and that much of the flow of the experience has to be decided by the player .
" film production companies are far more interested in video games than they ever have been .
they can see the crossover too , " says edmondson .
" ridley scott associates were genuinely keen and enthusiastic to become involved .
they can see the rise of games as a serious complement to music and film as an accepted form of entertainment . "
which is all well and good , but it also smacks of that all-consuming monster , franchise culture , wherein standards are compromised in the name of creating a cross-medium brand that bulldozes its way into the consciousness .
losing the will personally , i have not played a game that has made me lose the will to live as rapidly as driver3 for a long while .
i do not have a problem , like some games commentators , with narrative-heavy games .
but i do have a problem with games that promise so much and fail so roundly .
watching its opening cut scenes , i was intrigued .
but then i started actually playing the thing .
frankly , the on-foot controls are poor , the driving is unforgiving and the graphics involve hideous amounts of pop-up .
driver3 could have been so much better , but i suspect reflections got intoxicated by their filmmaking aspirations and the actual playability got overlooked .
i do not really care about a game with a flashy cast , nifty " camera " angles and a " film director " function when it is no fun to actually play .

the bears are known to trek up to 20km -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- a night in their search for food , and are regularly seen rummaging through litter bins and skips in the quiet suburbs of foothill settlements .
they are now drawing crowds on warm evenings , and remote villages in particular are visited regularly by wild animals .
" suddenly i heard a great noise - a bear was trying to break into a stable where the sheep were closed in for the night , " one villager told bbc world service 's the carnivore trail programme .
" i shouted to my husband , ' gheorghie , wake up !
a bear is attacking the sheep ' . "
in this case , the bear was chased off by villagers awoken by the noise .
endangered species brown bears , being scavengers and omnivores , are quite able to live off the food that romanians throw out .
but there are increasing fears that they will soon become extinct in this part of the world .
romania is one of the very few countries in europe that permits limited bear hunting .
earlier this month , a number of people - including french president jacques chirac and actress bridgette bardot - wrote a letter to romania 's prime minister adrian nastase to voice their concerns about the fate of the bear .
bears will travel many miles a night to find food their letter was partially in response to the government 's decision to allow the shooting of 300 bears this year .
hunting-tourism has become big business in romania 's carpathian mountains , the last place in europe , apart from russia , where many large carnivores - bears , wolves and lynxes - can be found .
laszlo szeley-szabo , the president of the carpathian animal protection group the aves foundation , has also sent a report to mr nastase which detailed evidence that the bear population was down from the official figure of 6,300 to 2,500 .
" romania 's kill figures for the trophy-hunter market are way above a sustainable cull , " the aves foundation report argued .
" they endanger the species . "
the report goes on to say that official figures relied on evidence from local farmers ' sightings , and argued that different witnesses may be seeing the same bear at different points along its journey into the foothills .
the european union last year responded to the aves foundation 's concerns by pointing out that member states " have to ensure a favourable conservation status of natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of community interest " .
gunther verheugen , the eu commissioner supervising eu membership applications , has said that if romania joined the eu - as it hopes - eu laws would prohibit the bear hunting .
poacher threat the romanian government , however , says that its figures are accurate .
it also says that " foraging hungry bears are now causing serious damage to the livestock of people living in the small mountain villages of the carpathians " .
one carpathian shepherd told the carnivore trail that bears did sometimes take sheep , and that unless he could prove they had done so he would have to cover the cost of their loss himself .
however , he added that last year only a " handful " had been killed by bears .
romanian rubbish provides a tasty take-away but even were bear hunting to be banned in the future , the bears would still face another ongoing threat - poachers .
a number of poachers currently roam the mountains hunting the large carnivores , and their kills are not included in the quota .
some who have killed bears say that they were attacked and acted in self-defence , but studies of bear behaviour - which have shown they are wary of humans - indicate this may be unlikely .
" a man was recently attacked by a bear in the forest - but there is something fishy about the whole story , " one shepherd said .
" he refuses to explain what happened , or where it was .
he may have been a poacher .
bears are afraid of humans .
they do n't attack unless they 're provoked . "

the current primary school in st clement is split into two , with a main road running in between .
the education authority says that is a safety hazard and causes problems when teachers need to move the children between the buildings .
it also says the rooms in the old building are not big enough for the growing number of children that are taught there .
