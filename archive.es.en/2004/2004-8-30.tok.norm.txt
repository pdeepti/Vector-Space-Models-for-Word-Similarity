but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity .

former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?

yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.08.2004 schumacher rewrites the history books again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second on the day but without equal in terms of championship success it was not quite business as usual for michael schumacher on sunday .
he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service , andrea nahles , the head of the party 's health reform working group announced sunday .
the spd proposes to slap statutory insurance premiums on profits gained from capital investment as well as on germans at the top of the income scale who are presently allowed to opt out of state-run health schemes in favor of private insurance .
nahles said that the changes will achieve a reduction in insurance premiums by more than 1 percent and will keep them stable for up 15 years .
employers ' representatives have said the spd ’ s proposals are unlikely to lower premiums - currently at a record 14 percent of income - and therefore won ’ t reduce the high costs of labor in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said the plan would not be implemented before the next general election in 2006 . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale 26.08.2004 -pipe- germany gets new iraqi ambassador 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2004 fashion shoot challenges spain 's socialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's sensitivity to the gender balance has helped his popularity spain 's government has been hailed as unprecedently progressive for the high-level roles given to women .
but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2004 ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine is n't making his former colleagues happy after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder . the mass demonstrations against reforms in germany have dominated the political debate in recent weeks , but they are expected to reach a fever pitch on monday with the participation of lafontaine , the former leader of the social democratic party .
recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

as far as attempted auto theft goes , one german car thief really could be accused of falling asleep at the wheel . the 46-year-old would-be auto thief had selected his car of choice after checking out the vehicles stored at the multi-storey car park at hanover airport recently .
after successfully breaking into the car , however , the thief was apparently overcome with sleepiness . the owners of the car came back from holiday to find the man had made himself comfortable in their car , slumbering under blankets and propped up with cushions .
despite being arrested later by the police in possession of the tools he used to break into the car , the thief protested his innocence before being escorted away to face charges . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .

france 's president will join the talks on tuesday . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin will meet in the southern russian holiday resort of sochi on monday night for two days of talks on a series of political and economic issues . they ’ ll be joined on tuesday by french president jacques chirac who ’ s currently involved in a crisis management operation to free two french journalists held in iraq by militants demanding that france end its ban on muslim headscarves in schools . the meeting in the black sea resort will be the third mini-summit between the leaders of russia , france and germany after the emergence of a moscow-paris-berlin axis in the run-up to the war on iraq .
the three nations formed a coalition based on their strong opposition to us-led military intervention in iraq .
this time the gathering which starts on monday evening is overshadowed by two simultaneous plane crashes in russia last week . russian security officers found traces of explosives on both planes , which makes it likely that the crashes were caused by chechen terrorists , ahead of sunday 's elections in chechnya .
but german government spokesman thomas steg insisted that there ’ s no reason whatsoever to worry about security at the sochi meeting . security fears allayed " the russian president is the host at the sochi meeting , and we don ’ t have the slightest doubt that security measures will up to the mark , " steg told dw-radio .
" the plane crashes in russia last week which may have had a terrorist background don ’ t suggest a higher security risk for the mini-summit . " " there have been close contacts between security agents from our nations ahead of the summit , and you can rest assured that everything has been done to plug any potential security gaps so that the summit can go ahead as planned without any changes .

" it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 . " " it has to be said , though , " the spokesman added , " that talks will have an informal character in as far as there will be no official declarations at the end of the summit . " schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .
moscow has had several run-ins with the osce of late , claiming that the pan-european body concentrates too much on human rights and too little on security , notably fighting terrorism . chechnya and opec to be discussed the osce for its part has been at loggerheads with russia over the kremlin ’ s policy in the separatist republic of chechnya , and the way elections were held there on sunday will not be conducive to improving this troubled relationship .
there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .
however , putin will not be made an honorary doctor of hamburg university as originally planned , because more than 50 doctors had protested against the award , saying that the russian democracy under putin was assuming too many authoritarian traits . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining eu-russian relations the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .
but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws .
-lrb- june 19 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , moscow seek to boost bilateral ties berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout all change in bundesliga title race champions extend winning streak dortmund gives away win in final minutes sports -pipe- 30.08.2004 leverkusen go top as champions slip up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's 14th match without loss moved them into pole position bayer leverkusen 's 4-1 thrashing of bayern munich proved to be more than just an impressive result .
the victory , and werder bremen 's loss at wolfsburg , meant leverkusen went top of the league . bayer leverkusen had not beaten bayern munich for almost two years but changed that statistic in style after crushing felix magath 's side 4-1 on saturday to take top spot in the bundesliga . bayer take over from german champions werder bremen who dropped to third after falling to a shock 2-1 home reverse against vfl wolfsburg on sunday . pre-match hype in leverkusen surrounded the return of brazilians lucio , ze roberto and german international michael ballack , stars of bayer 's run to the 2002 champions league final , but all three had a miserable afternoon as bayern collapsed at the bayarena . two of leverkusen 's new stars , brazilian franca and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , stole the headlines with two goals apiece as bayer stretched their unbeaten run to 14 matches and proved they are genuine title contenders .
" the team played like i wanted it to today , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" franca and berbatov were outstanding and i am delighted with their performances because they scored two goals apiece and tracked back too . " ailton off in schalke defeat aside from lucio , ailton was another brazilian to have a bad day as he was sent off in schalke 04 's 2-0 loss against hansa rostock .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .

the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

if a two-thirds majority in the bundestag - the lower house of parliament - voted to amend the country 's constitution to allow for referendums , one could take place to decide on the eu document , government spokesman hans langguth said on monday .
but he ruled out a decision that would only allow an isolated referendum on the one issue .
both the opposition cdu and the fdp criticized proposing such legislation , calling the move populist and deceptive .
without the opposition 's support , the bill would not garner the necessary majority in parliament .

if a two-thirds majority in the bundestag - the lower house of parliament - voted to amend the country 's constitution to allow for referendums , one could take place to decide on the eu document , government spokesman hans langguth said on monday .
but he ruled out a decision that would only allow an isolated referendum on the one issue .
both the opposition cdu and the fdp criticized proposing such legislation , calling the move populist and deceptive .
without the opposition 's support , the bill would not garner the necessary majority in parliament .
social democratic party head franz müntefering announced on sunday his party would vet the legislation to change the german constitution in the fall . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

if a two-thirds majority in the bundestag - the lower house of parliament - voted to amend the country 's constitution to allow for referendums , one could take place to decide on the eu document , government spokesman hans langguth said on monday .
but he ruled out a decision that would only allow an isolated referendum on the one issue .
both the opposition cdu and the fdp criticized proposing such legislation , calling the move populist and deceptive .
without the opposition 's support , the bill would not garner the necessary majority in parliament .
social democratic party head franz müntefering announced on sunday his party would vet the legislation to change the german constitution in the fall . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the victory , and werder bremen 's loss at wolfsburg , meant leverkusen went top of the league . bayer leverkusen had not beaten bayern munich for almost two years but changed that statistic in style after crushing felix magath 's side 4-1 on saturday to take top spot in the bundesliga . bayer take over from german champions werder bremen who dropped to third after falling to a shock 2-1 home reverse against vfl wolfsburg on sunday . pre-match hype in leverkusen surrounded the return of brazilians lucio , ze roberto and german international michael ballack , stars of bayer 's run to the 2002 champions league final , but all three had a miserable afternoon as bayern collapsed at the bayarena . two of leverkusen 's new stars , brazilian franca and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , stole the headlines with two goals apiece as bayer stretched their unbeaten run to 14 matches and proved they are genuine title contenders .
" the team played like i wanted it to today , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" franca and berbatov were outstanding and i am delighted with their performances because they scored two goals apiece and tracked back too . " ailton off in schalke defeat aside from lucio , ailton was another brazilian to have a bad day as he was sent off in schalke 04 's 2-0 loss against hansa rostock .
last season 's top goalscorer has yet to open his account in the 2004/05 campaign and his indifferent season continued as he picked up a red card on the chime of half-time following a fracas with koakim persson and uwe mohrle . ailton left the arena auf schalke straight after his dismissal and needed to be called back by schalke 04 officials with the brazilian required to take a random drugs test .
he would have been deemed as having returned a positive result if he had not returned . ailton 's former club bremen needed just a point against wolfsburg to retain top spot but came unstuck in a 2-1 reverse at the weserstadion .

" we applied pressure late on but it was too late . " klose 's first bremen goal not enough german international thomas brdaric opened the scoring in the 46th minute , the first league goal bremen had conceded , before pablo thiam added a second after 53 minutes .
miroslav klose scored his first bundesliga goal in a bremen shirt on 71 minutes but it was in vain . borussia dortmund looked to be coasting to a home win against hanover 96 courtesy of czech republic midfielder tomas rosicky 's 29th minute strike .
however , 19-year old hanover defender per mertesacker had other ideas and grabbed a headed equalizer from a corner in the second minute of injury time to save the game for the visitors and record his first bundesliga goal . arminia bielefeld fell victim to bochum 's senegalese striker mamadou diabang late strike in injury time after bielefeld 's delron buckley appeared to have secured a draw after canceling out diabang 's first with a strike in the 87th minute .
bochum played with 10 men for half an hour after christoph preuss was sent off for collecting two yellow cards but still managed to complete a dramatic away victory . kuranyi hat-trick moves stuttgart into second vfb stuttgart occupy second place in the bundesliga after defeating kaiserslautern 3-2 with german international kevin kuranyi scoring a hat-trick to send kaiserslautern to the bottom of the table .
former germany striker carsten jancker and midfielder jochen seitz appeared to have done enough to earn kaiserslautern a draw until kuranyi 's third in the 81st minute . borussia mönchengladbach avoided an embarrassing defeat against freiburg thanks to a narrowly angled goal from mönchengladbach 's oliver nueville late in the second half which ensured a draw after freiburg took the lead through roda antar in the 28th minute . hertha berlin recorded another 1-1 draw against fsv mainz after going ahead through fredi bobic early in the second half .
but a scrappy game ended in a draw when jürgen kramny scored from a free kick 10 minutes later , leaving the berlin club still looking for their first win of the season . hamburg off the bottom with thrilling win hamburg coach klaus toppmoller was handed some breathing space with a thrilling 4-3 win over fc nuremberg .
hamburg had been knocked out of the intertoto cup , humbled by sc paderborn in the german cup and lost their opening two fixtures of the bundesliga campaign .

the victory , and werder bremen 's loss at wolfsburg , meant leverkusen went top of the league . bayer leverkusen had not beaten bayern munich for almost two years but changed that statistic in style after crushing felix magath 's side 4-1 on saturday to take top spot in the bundesliga . bayer take over from german champions werder bremen who dropped to third after falling to a shock 2-1 home reverse against vfl wolfsburg on sunday . pre-match hype in leverkusen surrounded the return of brazilians lucio , ze roberto and german international michael ballack , stars of bayer 's run to the 2002 champions league final , but all three had a miserable afternoon as bayern collapsed at the bayarena . two of leverkusen 's new stars , brazilian franca and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , stole the headlines with two goals apiece as bayer stretched their unbeaten run to 14 matches and proved they are genuine title contenders .
" the team played like i wanted it to today , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" franca and berbatov were outstanding and i am delighted with their performances because they scored two goals apiece and tracked back too . " ailton off in schalke defeat aside from lucio , ailton was another brazilian to have a bad day as he was sent off in schalke 04 's 2-0 loss against hansa rostock .
last season 's top goalscorer has yet to open his account in the 2004/05 campaign and his indifferent season continued as he picked up a red card on the chime of half-time following a fracas with koakim persson and uwe mohrle . ailton left the arena auf schalke straight after his dismissal and needed to be called back by schalke 04 officials with the brazilian required to take a random drugs test .
he would have been deemed as having returned a positive result if he had not returned . ailton 's former club bremen needed just a point against wolfsburg to retain top spot but came unstuck in a 2-1 reverse at the weserstadion .
" there was not enough movement , " said coach thomas schaaf .
" we applied pressure late on but it was too late . " klose 's first bremen goal not enough german international thomas brdaric opened the scoring in the 46th minute , the first league goal bremen had conceded , before pablo thiam added a second after 53 minutes .
miroslav klose scored his first bundesliga goal in a bremen shirt on 71 minutes but it was in vain . borussia dortmund looked to be coasting to a home win against hanover 96 courtesy of czech republic midfielder tomas rosicky 's 29th minute strike .
however , 19-year old hanover defender per mertesacker had other ideas and grabbed a headed equalizer from a corner in the second minute of injury time to save the game for the visitors and record his first bundesliga goal . arminia bielefeld fell victim to bochum 's senegalese striker mamadou diabang late strike in injury time after bielefeld 's delron buckley appeared to have secured a draw after canceling out diabang 's first with a strike in the 87th minute .
bochum played with 10 men for half an hour after christoph preuss was sent off for collecting two yellow cards but still managed to complete a dramatic away victory . kuranyi hat-trick moves stuttgart into second vfb stuttgart occupy second place in the bundesliga after defeating kaiserslautern 3-2 with german international kevin kuranyi scoring a hat-trick to send kaiserslautern to the bottom of the table .
former germany striker carsten jancker and midfielder jochen seitz appeared to have done enough to earn kaiserslautern a draw until kuranyi 's third in the 81st minute . borussia mönchengladbach avoided an embarrassing defeat against freiburg thanks to a narrowly angled goal from mönchengladbach 's oliver nueville late in the second half which ensured a draw after freiburg took the lead through roda antar in the 28th minute . hertha berlin recorded another 1-1 draw against fsv mainz after going ahead through fredi bobic early in the second half .
but a scrappy game ended in a draw when jürgen kramny scored from a free kick 10 minutes later , leaving the berlin club still looking for their first win of the season . hamburg off the bottom with thrilling win hamburg coach klaus toppmoller was handed some breathing space with a thrilling 4-3 win over fc nuremberg .
hamburg had been knocked out of the intertoto cup , humbled by sc paderborn in the german cup and lost their opening two fixtures of the bundesliga campaign .
however a late goal from german international benjamin lauth secured a first three points for hamburg and moved the 1983 european champions off bottom spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich mauled by marauding leverkusen bayern munich came to the bayarena on saturday looking to close the gap on werder bremen at the top of the league .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.08.2004 schumacher rewrites the history books again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second on the day but without equal in terms of championship success it was not quite business as usual for michael schumacher on sunday .
he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

france 's president will join the talks on tuesday . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin will meet in the southern russian holiday resort of sochi on monday night for two days of talks on a series of political and economic issues . they ’ ll be joined on tuesday by french president jacques chirac who ’ s currently involved in a crisis management operation to free two french journalists held in iraq by militants demanding that france end its ban on muslim headscarves in schools . the meeting in the black sea resort will be the third mini-summit between the leaders of russia , france and germany after the emergence of a moscow-paris-berlin axis in the run-up to the war on iraq .
the three nations formed a coalition based on their strong opposition to us-led military intervention in iraq .
this time the gathering which starts on monday evening is overshadowed by two simultaneous plane crashes in russia last week . russian security officers found traces of explosives on both planes , which makes it likely that the crashes were caused by chechen terrorists , ahead of sunday 's elections in chechnya .
but german government spokesman thomas steg insisted that there ’ s no reason whatsoever to worry about security at the sochi meeting . security fears allayed " the russian president is the host at the sochi meeting , and we don ’ t have the slightest doubt that security measures will up to the mark , " steg told dw-radio .
" the plane crashes in russia last week which may have had a terrorist background don ’ t suggest a higher security risk for the mini-summit .

it ’ s clear that the russian president has a vested interest in intensifying consultations with the leaders of two major countries within the european union , " steg said . " it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 .

" schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .

there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .

" the sochi meeting has no fixed agenda .
it ’ s clear that the russian president has a vested interest in intensifying consultations with the leaders of two major countries within the european union , " steg said . " it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 . " " it has to be said , though , " the spokesman added , " that talks will have an informal character in as far as there will be no official declarations at the end of the summit . " schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .
moscow has had several run-ins with the osce of late , claiming that the pan-european body concentrates too much on human rights and too little on security , notably fighting terrorism . chechnya and opec to be discussed the osce for its part has been at loggerheads with russia over the kremlin ’ s policy in the separatist republic of chechnya , and the way elections were held there on sunday will not be conducive to improving this troubled relationship .
there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .
however , putin will not be made an honorary doctor of hamburg university as originally planned , because more than 50 doctors had protested against the award , saying that the russian democracy under putin was assuming too many authoritarian traits . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining eu-russian relations the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2004 ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine is n't making his former colleagues happy after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder . the mass demonstrations against reforms in germany have dominated the political debate in recent weeks , but they are expected to reach a fever pitch on monday with the participation of lafontaine , the former leader of the social democratic party .
recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2004 fashion shoot challenges spain 's socialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's sensitivity to the gender balance has helped his popularity spain 's government has been hailed as unprecedently progressive for the high-level roles given to women .
but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .
he outlined plans to fight terrorism , pursue liberal domestic reforms and a pro-european foreign policy and pull spanish troops out of iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout all change in bundesliga title race champions extend winning streak dortmund gives away win in final minutes sports -pipe- 30.08.2004 leverkusen go top as champions slip up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's 14th match without loss moved them into pole position bayer leverkusen 's 4-1 thrashing of bayern munich proved to be more than just an impressive result .
the victory , and werder bremen 's loss at wolfsburg , meant leverkusen went top of the league . bayer leverkusen had not beaten bayern munich for almost two years but changed that statistic in style after crushing felix magath 's side 4-1 on saturday to take top spot in the bundesliga . bayer take over from german champions werder bremen who dropped to third after falling to a shock 2-1 home reverse against vfl wolfsburg on sunday . pre-match hype in leverkusen surrounded the return of brazilians lucio , ze roberto and german international michael ballack , stars of bayer 's run to the 2002 champions league final , but all three had a miserable afternoon as bayern collapsed at the bayarena . two of leverkusen 's new stars , brazilian franca and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , stole the headlines with two goals apiece as bayer stretched their unbeaten run to 14 matches and proved they are genuine title contenders .
" the team played like i wanted it to today , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" franca and berbatov were outstanding and i am delighted with their performances because they scored two goals apiece and tracked back too . " ailton off in schalke defeat aside from lucio , ailton was another brazilian to have a bad day as he was sent off in schalke 04 's 2-0 loss against hansa rostock .
last season 's top goalscorer has yet to open his account in the 2004/05 campaign and his indifferent season continued as he picked up a red card on the chime of half-time following a fracas with koakim persson and uwe mohrle . ailton left the arena auf schalke straight after his dismissal and needed to be called back by schalke 04 officials with the brazilian required to take a random drugs test .
he would have been deemed as having returned a positive result if he had not returned . ailton 's former club bremen needed just a point against wolfsburg to retain top spot but came unstuck in a 2-1 reverse at the weserstadion .
" there was not enough movement , " said coach thomas schaaf .
" we applied pressure late on but it was too late . " klose 's first bremen goal not enough german international thomas brdaric opened the scoring in the 46th minute , the first league goal bremen had conceded , before pablo thiam added a second after 53 minutes .
miroslav klose scored his first bundesliga goal in a bremen shirt on 71 minutes but it was in vain . borussia dortmund looked to be coasting to a home win against hanover 96 courtesy of czech republic midfielder tomas rosicky 's 29th minute strike .
however , 19-year old hanover defender per mertesacker had other ideas and grabbed a headed equalizer from a corner in the second minute of injury time to save the game for the visitors and record his first bundesliga goal . arminia bielefeld fell victim to bochum 's senegalese striker mamadou diabang late strike in injury time after bielefeld 's delron buckley appeared to have secured a draw after canceling out diabang 's first with a strike in the 87th minute .
bochum played with 10 men for half an hour after christoph preuss was sent off for collecting two yellow cards but still managed to complete a dramatic away victory . kuranyi hat-trick moves stuttgart into second vfb stuttgart occupy second place in the bundesliga after defeating kaiserslautern 3-2 with german international kevin kuranyi scoring a hat-trick to send kaiserslautern to the bottom of the table .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity .

the spd proposes to slap statutory insurance premiums on profits gained from capital investment as well as on germans at the top of the income scale who are presently allowed to opt out of state-run health schemes in favor of private insurance .
nahles said that the changes will achieve a reduction in insurance premiums by more than 1 percent and will keep them stable for up 15 years .
employers ' representatives have said the spd ’ s proposals are unlikely to lower premiums - currently at a record 14 percent of income - and therefore won ’ t reduce the high costs of labor in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.08.2004 schumacher rewrites the history books again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second on the day but without equal in terms of championship success it was not quite business as usual for michael schumacher on sunday .
he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

the spd proposes to slap statutory insurance premiums on profits gained from capital investment as well as on germans at the top of the income scale who are presently allowed to opt out of state-run health schemes in favor of private insurance .
nahles said that the changes will achieve a reduction in insurance premiums by more than 1 percent and will keep them stable for up 15 years .
employers ' representatives have said the spd ’ s proposals are unlikely to lower premiums - currently at a record 14 percent of income - and therefore won ’ t reduce the high costs of labor in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said the plan would not be implemented before the next general election in 2006 . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale 26.08.2004 -pipe- germany gets new iraqi ambassador radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .

under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .

the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

the spd proposes to slap statutory insurance premiums on profits gained from capital investment as well as on germans at the top of the income scale who are presently allowed to opt out of state-run health schemes in favor of private insurance .
nahles said that the changes will achieve a reduction in insurance premiums by more than 1 percent and will keep them stable for up 15 years .
employers ' representatives have said the spd ’ s proposals are unlikely to lower premiums - currently at a record 14 percent of income - and therefore won ’ t reduce the high costs of labor in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said the plan would not be implemented before the next general election in 2006 . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale 26.08.2004 -pipe- germany gets new iraqi ambassador 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .
" i 'm just very proud to have achieved this together with the team , which i think is extraordinary , " the driver said . it was the familiar winning synergy of driving skill and finely-tuned machinery which saw schumacher survive a chaotic start and do enough to win the title in belgium in an incident-packed race which saw four cars eliminated and several others damaged .
barrichello 's contribution recognized the german 's team mate rubens barrichello was the first to benefit from the opening lap activity , creeping up to third amid the on-track wreckage .
but despite hanging on to the last podium place at the chequered flag , it would all be in vain in terms of the championship race . barrichello has not been able to touch his team mate this season but has helped take ferrari to further greatness and has had a hand in assisting schumacher 's success .
together , both schumacher 's and barrichello 's dominant driving has also helped ferrari seal their sixth constructors ' title in hungary two weeks ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher wins sixth title early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan .

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "
" if you think what i have achieved here , how things started here and finally i can say i won a very important and a very prestigious number , a seventh championship here at spa . "
ready to become all-time great despite his famous reluctance to refer to the record books , schumacher 's name has already topped argentine great juan manuel fangio , who had won the most world crowns with five in the 1950s , and french legend alain prost , who was top of the pile for race wins with 51 in his career . he could still top late brazilian hero senna 's record of 65 career pole positions by the end of the year as he needs four more with four races remaining .
if not , he should do next year . schumacher has taken 82 race victories and 62 pole positions in a career that has spanned 208 races with jordan , benetton and ferrari but his greatest success has come in scarlet cars . a winning relationship he has been a ferrari driver since 1996 and his team have benefited greatly from the eight seasons the record breaking driver has been with them , a fact not lost on his crew on sunday who greeted schumacher with a pit board reading ‘ simply the best ’ when he crossed the line . schumacher would also be the first to heap praise on the cars and support he has counted on in that time .

france 's president will join the talks on tuesday . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin will meet in the southern russian holiday resort of sochi on monday night for two days of talks on a series of political and economic issues . they ’ ll be joined on tuesday by french president jacques chirac who ’ s currently involved in a crisis management operation to free two french journalists held in iraq by militants demanding that france end its ban on muslim headscarves in schools . the meeting in the black sea resort will be the third mini-summit between the leaders of russia , france and germany after the emergence of a moscow-paris-berlin axis in the run-up to the war on iraq .
the three nations formed a coalition based on their strong opposition to us-led military intervention in iraq .
this time the gathering which starts on monday evening is overshadowed by two simultaneous plane crashes in russia last week . russian security officers found traces of explosives on both planes , which makes it likely that the crashes were caused by chechen terrorists , ahead of sunday 's elections in chechnya .
but german government spokesman thomas steg insisted that there ’ s no reason whatsoever to worry about security at the sochi meeting . security fears allayed " the russian president is the host at the sochi meeting , and we don ’ t have the slightest doubt that security measures will up to the mark , " steg told dw-radio .
" the plane crashes in russia last week which may have had a terrorist background don ’ t suggest a higher security risk for the mini-summit . " " there have been close contacts between security agents from our nations ahead of the summit , and you can rest assured that everything has been done to plug any potential security gaps so that the summit can go ahead as planned without any changes . " war-zone reconstruction on agenda the government spokesman added that the gathering will most likely focus on post-war reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq , but will also deal with a number of european economic issues . " the sochi meeting has no fixed agenda .
it ’ s clear that the russian president has a vested interest in intensifying consultations with the leaders of two major countries within the european union , " steg said . " it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 . " " it has to be said , though , " the spokesman added , " that talks will have an informal character in as far as there will be no official declarations at the end of the summit . " schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .
moscow has had several run-ins with the osce of late , claiming that the pan-european body concentrates too much on human rights and too little on security , notably fighting terrorism . chechnya and opec to be discussed the osce for its part has been at loggerheads with russia over the kremlin ’ s policy in the separatist republic of chechnya , and the way elections were held there on sunday will not be conducive to improving this troubled relationship .
there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .

france 's president will join the talks on tuesday . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin will meet in the southern russian holiday resort of sochi on monday night for two days of talks on a series of political and economic issues . they ’ ll be joined on tuesday by french president jacques chirac who ’ s currently involved in a crisis management operation to free two french journalists held in iraq by militants demanding that france end its ban on muslim headscarves in schools . the meeting in the black sea resort will be the third mini-summit between the leaders of russia , france and germany after the emergence of a moscow-paris-berlin axis in the run-up to the war on iraq .
the three nations formed a coalition based on their strong opposition to us-led military intervention in iraq .
this time the gathering which starts on monday evening is overshadowed by two simultaneous plane crashes in russia last week . russian security officers found traces of explosives on both planes , which makes it likely that the crashes were caused by chechen terrorists , ahead of sunday 's elections in chechnya .
but german government spokesman thomas steg insisted that there ’ s no reason whatsoever to worry about security at the sochi meeting . security fears allayed " the russian president is the host at the sochi meeting , and we don ’ t have the slightest doubt that security measures will up to the mark , " steg told dw-radio .
" the plane crashes in russia last week which may have had a terrorist background don ’ t suggest a higher security risk for the mini-summit . " " there have been close contacts between security agents from our nations ahead of the summit , and you can rest assured that everything has been done to plug any potential security gaps so that the summit can go ahead as planned without any changes . " war-zone reconstruction on agenda the government spokesman added that the gathering will most likely focus on post-war reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq , but will also deal with a number of european economic issues . " the sochi meeting has no fixed agenda .
it ’ s clear that the russian president has a vested interest in intensifying consultations with the leaders of two major countries within the european union , " steg said . " it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 . " " it has to be said , though , " the spokesman added , " that talks will have an informal character in as far as there will be no official declarations at the end of the summit . " schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .
moscow has had several run-ins with the osce of late , claiming that the pan-european body concentrates too much on human rights and too little on security , notably fighting terrorism . chechnya and opec to be discussed the osce for its part has been at loggerheads with russia over the kremlin ’ s policy in the separatist republic of chechnya , and the way elections were held there on sunday will not be conducive to improving this troubled relationship .
there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .
however , putin will not be made an honorary doctor of hamburg university as originally planned , because more than 50 doctors had protested against the award , saying that the russian democracy under putin was assuming too many authoritarian traits . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining eu-russian relations the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .

france 's president will join the talks on tuesday . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin will meet in the southern russian holiday resort of sochi on monday night for two days of talks on a series of political and economic issues . they ’ ll be joined on tuesday by french president jacques chirac who ’ s currently involved in a crisis management operation to free two french journalists held in iraq by militants demanding that france end its ban on muslim headscarves in schools . the meeting in the black sea resort will be the third mini-summit between the leaders of russia , france and germany after the emergence of a moscow-paris-berlin axis in the run-up to the war on iraq .
the three nations formed a coalition based on their strong opposition to us-led military intervention in iraq .
this time the gathering which starts on monday evening is overshadowed by two simultaneous plane crashes in russia last week . russian security officers found traces of explosives on both planes , which makes it likely that the crashes were caused by chechen terrorists , ahead of sunday 's elections in chechnya .
but german government spokesman thomas steg insisted that there ’ s no reason whatsoever to worry about security at the sochi meeting . security fears allayed " the russian president is the host at the sochi meeting , and we don ’ t have the slightest doubt that security measures will up to the mark , " steg told dw-radio .
" the plane crashes in russia last week which may have had a terrorist background don ’ t suggest a higher security risk for the mini-summit . " " there have been close contacts between security agents from our nations ahead of the summit , and you can rest assured that everything has been done to plug any potential security gaps so that the summit can go ahead as planned without any changes . " war-zone reconstruction on agenda the government spokesman added that the gathering will most likely focus on post-war reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq , but will also deal with a number of european economic issues . " the sochi meeting has no fixed agenda .
it ’ s clear that the russian president has a vested interest in intensifying consultations with the leaders of two major countries within the european union , " steg said . " it ’ s expected that one of the central topics at the meeting will be how to shape the envisaged strategic partnership between russia and the enlarged european union with some of russia ’ s neighboring countries now also being members of the club of 25 . " " it has to be said , though , " the spokesman added , " that talks will have an informal character in as far as there will be no official declarations at the end of the summit . " schröder looks to closer european ties schröder , who recently adopted a russian toddler and who has cultivated close relations with both putin and chirac , said earlier this week that relations with russia were paramount for europe 's future . " the positive outlook we have for this continent will in the long run only succeed if the european union gains a truly strategic relationship or partnership with russia and vice versa , " schröder told rtl television . russian president vladimir putin is set to push for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to be reformed with a view to strengthening its role as a bridge between the east and the west .
the kremlin attaches great importance to the body as the only organization in which the united states , russia and the european union speak on an equal footing .
moscow has had several run-ins with the osce of late , claiming that the pan-european body concentrates too much on human rights and too little on security , notably fighting terrorism . chechnya and opec to be discussed the osce for its part has been at loggerheads with russia over the kremlin ’ s policy in the separatist republic of chechnya , and the way elections were held there on sunday will not be conducive to improving this troubled relationship .
there are also indications that the leaders of russia , france and germany will raise issues related to recent developments on the oil market with prices having been at record highs and worries over future supplies . schröder and putin will be able to continue their dialogue at bilateral government consultations in hamburg in mid-september .
however , putin will not be made an honorary doctor of hamburg university as originally planned , because more than 50 doctors had protested against the award , saying that the russian democracy under putin was assuming too many authoritarian traits . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining eu-russian relations the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .
but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws .
-lrb- june 19 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , moscow seek to boost bilateral ties berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2004 fashion shoot challenges spain 's socialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's sensitivity to the gender balance has helped his popularity spain 's government has been hailed as unprecedently progressive for the high-level roles given to women .
but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .
he outlined plans to fight terrorism , pursue liberal domestic reforms and a pro-european foreign policy and pull spanish troops out of iraq .
-lrb- april 16 , 2004 -rrb- spain 's socialists win elections anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .
led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity .

former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?

yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2004 ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine is n't making his former colleagues happy after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder . the mass demonstrations against reforms in germany have dominated the political debate in recent weeks , but they are expected to reach a fever pitch on monday with the participation of lafontaine , the former leader of the social democratic party .
recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

but after eight female ministers appeared in vogue magazine , questions have arisen as to its true nature . fashionable women across spain have a surprise in store when they visit their local hair and beauty salon .
as they reach across the coffee table for the latest issue of vogue , they 'll find an " exclusive " photo shoot .
but this ten page glamour spread does n't feature top models like claudia schiffer . instead , reclining in sartorial elegance on couches at government headquarters , are the eight female ministers in prime minister rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government , smiling awkwardly from the glossy pages .
the vogue exclusive - entitled " eight women for history " - has caused a storm of criticism . until now , no one has questioned the new socialist government 's determination to push for real gender equality . when the socialists came to power in march , the days of old-fashioned , spanish machismo appeared to be numbered . sensitive zapatero rang in the changes half of the members of the new government were women and within weeks new legislation was brought in to help counter domestic violence . prime minister zapatero even said that while " other people wear the trousers , i prefer to say that i bring sensitivity . "
but after the photos in vogue magazine , even socialist colleagues are now wondering whether the prime minister really is in touch with his feminine side .
former socialist minister cristina alberdi told dw-radio that , as a feminist all her life , she felt extremely disappointed .
pilar martinez , from the association for the promotion of women , agreed , saying , " it 's a way of behaving that is opposed to what the government appears to say and think . "
fashion shoot supports equality , says government but can a fashion magazine really undermine the cause of gender equality ?
on the contrary , a spokesperson for the government said , the message from the photo shoot is a progressive one , in favor of equality and in favor of women .
yolanda sacristán the director of spanish vogue , explained that the objective was to capture this unique moment in spain 's history when , for the first time , women really share the power of government .
sacristán said women should n't have to justify why they like to dress up .
and the eight ministers clearly enjoyed it .
deputy prime minister maría teresa fernández de la vega , who likes to wear , close fitting suits , in an oriental style , has argued that the vogue photo shoot is a valid way of getting socialist messages across ; cristina narbona , has professed a liking for unpretentious , practical clothes , as casual as possible , in her role as minister for the environment . danny wood -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new spanish pm vows to push reforms , crack down on terror jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .

the spd proposes to slap statutory insurance premiums on profits gained from capital investment as well as on germans at the top of the income scale who are presently allowed to opt out of state-run health schemes in favor of private insurance .
nahles said that the changes will achieve a reduction in insurance premiums by more than 1 percent and will keep them stable for up 15 years .
employers ' representatives have said the spd ’ s proposals are unlikely to lower premiums - currently at a record 14 percent of income - and therefore won ’ t reduce the high costs of labor in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said the plan would not be implemented before the next general election in 2006 . more briefs 30.08.2004 -pipe- letter bomb explodes in bavaria 27.08.2004 -pipe- four months probation for chancellor slap 27.08.2004 -pipe- german cannibal inspires new rammstein hit 27.08.2004 -pipe- law experts warn war on terror undermining human rights 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany 's fischer starts middle east tour 27.08.2004 -pipe- germany expels jordanian said linked to zarqawi 26.08.2004 -pipe- nazi holiday complex goes up for sale 26.08.2004 -pipe- germany gets new iraqi ambassador 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.08.2004 schumacher rewrites the history books again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second on the day but without equal in terms of championship success it was not quite business as usual for michael schumacher on sunday .
he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "

he was on the podium at the end of the belgian grand prix but in second place .
what was usual was the fact that he was celebrating another world title . michael schumacher 's record-extending seventh formula one world championship title had become an inevitability over the course of this season , but when it was eventually confirmed after his unfamiliar second place in the belgian grand prix on sunday , the magnitude of the german driver 's achievement put complaints of monotony in the shade . statistics , schumacher says , mean nothing to him but he can not have failed to notice his dominance this season has been the most impressive by a single driver in the entire history of the formula one world championship . in 1988 , two of the sports greatest drivers ayrton senna and alain prost together secured 15 race wins out of 16 for their mclaren-honda team but they were made to share their success .
schumacher has taken it all himself . schumacher has already broken his previous record of 11 wins in a season , set in 2002 , which itself surpassed his own previous best of nine , which he set in 1995 , 2000 and 2001 and shared with briton nigel mansell . unstoppable and inevitable the german supreme has won 12 of the 14 races so far with a run of metronomic performances that has seen him fail to finish just once in the last 27 races when he crashed out in monaco in may .
from melbourne to malaysia , montreal to magny cours , come rain or shine , schumacher has been virtually unstoppable ever since he declared he would be winning for fun this season . and on sunday at spa-francorchamps , the circuit where the young schumacher first entered the formula one scene some 13 years ago , the german 's seventh , and fifth consecutive , world title also heralded a milestone for his team - the 700th formula one race undertaken by ferrari .
“ it ’ s the 700th grand prix for ferrari , it ’ s my seventh win in the championship and it ’ s the right number for us , " schumacher told the post-race press conference .
“ it is very special , we are here in spa , which does mean a lot to me , the circuit , the place . "

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .
but the biggest event is expected in leipzig , site of the 1989 monday demonstrations that led to the fall of the berlin wall and where lafontaine is expected to address the crowds monday .
a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

a thorn in the spd 's side his presence has angered members of the spd , who still see his sudden 1999 resignation as schröder 's finance minister and his recent and antagonistic return to politics as absolute betrayal .
rather than offering any reasons for quitting at the time , lafontaine just wrote schröder a note stating : " dear mr. chancellor , i hereby resign as federal minister of finance .
yours sincerely , oskar lafontaine . "
" anyone who took leave in such an embarrassing way should just be humble and quiet , " said johannes kahrs , an spd politician .
the deputy chairman of the spd 's parliamentary group , michael müller , openly warned lafontaine that in pursuing " leftist politics " he should avoid agitating people , " otherwise they might swing to the right , " he said .
in recent weeks , lafontaine has emerged as an outspoken critic of the labor market reforms , and he 's even threatened to join a leftist break-away party if schröder does n't abandon his current reform measures .
though lafontaine holds little sway with schröder 's cabinet , spd officials fear that if he leaves the party , he could take members of the party 's left-wing faction with him .
but with turnout at last week 's marches of less than half the 150,000 expected by organizers , it 's hard to say whether lafontaine is joining a movement that is growing or petering out .
politicians in both the government and opposition are hoping for the latter , since the protests are fueling the popularity of the the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to east germany 's former communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25,000 people march in leipzig against planned labor market reforms with a view to monday 's demonstrations , opposition leader angela merkel of the christian democratic union , expressed her understanding for the protests in eastern germany .
at the same time , she warned against abusing the monday demonstrations for political gain .
" many people have very big worries and fear , " she said .
merkel also said the government needed to make more of an effort to listen to the people of eastern germany .
schröder defends proposals for his part , chancellor schröder has called on the protesters to be open to dialog with the government .
in a public television interview on sunday night , schröder warned protesters that they should be prepared to speak and not drown the chancellor out with whistles .
at several appearances last week , schröder was greeted with a chorus of boos and whistles and even a hail of eggs on two occasions .
schröder also defended the labor market reforms that triggered the demonstration as well as recent government proposals aimed at reducing the pain of the reforms for individuals .
under the so-called hartz iv reforms , the government plans to merge unemployment and welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed - a move expected to dramatically reducing the government entitlement for many jobless germans .
to offset the lost money , the government has proposed jobs that would pay nominal wages but would not be calculated against a jobless person 's welfare payments .
the jobs could mean as much as € 800 to € 1,000 in additional money for the long-term unemployed receiving welfare benefits .
critics have warned that the reforms threaten to push thousands of germans into poverty .
but on monday , the german association of municipalities dismissed those claims as untrue .
in a newspaper interview , the association 's director , gerd landsberg , said that a long-term unemployed couple with two children would actually get more money each month after the reforms than they did before .
he also said the reforms would improve the situation for young german workers who , for the first time , would have laws on the books requiring that jobs be created for them . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

recently , lafontaine has re-emerged from self-imposed political exile to become one of the most vociferous critics of the labor market reforms and welfare cuts championed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
when he joins the protests this week , he 'll be the most prominent political figure in the monday demonstration movement .
tens of thousands are expected to participate in the protests .
most of the action is expected to center on the states formerly belonging to east germany , where the unemployment rate remains staggeringly high .
in economically depressed saxony-anhalt , demonstrations are planned in more than a dozen cities .
eleven protest marches have been registered in thuringia and two marches are planned for berlin .

a new report says the east has enjoyed major economic growth . eastern germany has the highest unemployment rate in the country , the greatest dissatisfaction with the government 's reform course , and it 's also the center of monday demonstrations that have been drawing tens of thousands onto the streets to protest labor market reforms .
but as a region , it 's not as economically hopeless as it may seem .
german economic forecasters say the prospects for growth in the east are better than you may think .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel published excerpts of an unreleased study by germany 's reconstruction loan corporation -lrb- kfw -rrb- , a state-owned bank that supports small and medium-sized businesses , community investments and other projects designed to aid economic growth .
the report found that developments in the east have been much better than they have been represented .
the east , the report said , experienced much bigger growth than the west , but that increase had been overshadowed by the collapse of the construction industry .
the report said the construction crisis was the only reason that the eastern economy was limping behind .
" the situation is not nearly as bad as it is being presented , " joachim ragnitz of the institute for economic research in halle told the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
the economist said that cities like leipzig , dresden and chemnitz have tremendous growth potential in tourism as well as other industries like semiconductor , automobile or heavy machinery production .
3.7 annual growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the prescriptions in chancellor gerhard schröder 's " book on growth " appear to be working .
according to der spiegel , the report stated that from 1992 to 2003 , growth in the east increased 3.7 percent annually , compared to an anemic 1.2 percent in the west , if cleansed of the construction industry figures .
but the real success story , the report concluded , has been east german industry , which is drumming up greater revenues abroad than domestically .
" that means the manufacturing industry in the new states has become absolutely competitive , " the report stated .
major eastern german cities like dresden have succeeded during the past decade in attracting a number of blue chip companies .
in dresden , for example , volkswagen and us chipmaker amd have set up shop .
taken together with their suppliers , plus other high-tech companies , they have created thousands of jobs .
the chief economist at german insurance giant allianz has also recently been quoted stating that industry has been faring better in the eastern states than the west for some time now .
" now there 's a good foundation for a future in which many suppliers and service providers will move into the region and make it more competitive , " he said .
heise has also said he believes the gap between eastern and western germany will close in the coming years .
" for that reason , there 's going to be a lot more investment here in the coming years . "
artificial growth ?
yet despite success stories like dresden , the eastern german economy is still saddled with problems .
in germany 's western states , joblessness is about 8.5 percent , but in the east that figure is nearly double .
" it 's doubtful that eastern germany is showing a self-sustaining upswing , " thorsten polleit , chief economist at the british investment bank barclays capital told deutsche welle .
" the economic expansion is , in some regions , largely bolstered by state subsidies .
the need for reforms there is immense , especially , if they want to generate lasting jobs and growth . "
but other economists , including marcel thum of the ifo institute for economic research in dresden said structural reforms , including controversial labor market reforms , currently being carried out by the german government would also contribute to the growth of the eastern german economy .
" there are also going to be winners , " he told the web site tagesschau.de , " because people are going to be able to get jobs quicker in the near future . "
for workers with little training or lacking a higher education , he said new jobs in the service sector would create new opportunities . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : ex-spd leader to speak at monday protests after five years in political exile , former social democratic party leader oskar lafontaine will return to the political stage monday by attacking the economic reforms of his erstwhile partner , chancellor schröder .

buying abbey is seen as the last major merger opportunity within the british banking sector , which has undergone a wave of consolidation in the past ten years .

but video games with thought-provoking or political messages have emerged as a way of making those who play them a little more aware .
italy 's commercial capital , milan , is a city steeped in history and wealth .
it seems an unlikely place for a revolution .
but venture down a side street off the tourist map and the centro sociale la pergola can be found , a gathering point for a group of milan 's young radicals .
many of them are media professionals for whom the net has become an essential tool for political organisation .
" it 's because it 's a many-to-many medium , whereas traditional politics is done one-to-many - from gates to many , from murdoch to many , from berlusconi to many and so on , " said alex foti , from political activist group chainworkers .
" it is a way of harnessing the wisdom and vitality of the crowds , " he explained to bbc 's click online programme .
" social research has proved that groups , when confronted with well-defined problems , show a marked interest in them . "
the net allows the centro to organise political demonstrations cheaply and easily .
online instead for activists who can not take to the streets , the organisation 's website , molleindustria , or " soft industry " , has offered them the virtual equivalent .
there , they can take part in an online mayday parade which allows people to add to the throng and stylise their own marching demonstrator in an avatar form .
molleindustria is best known for its video games .
in line with its radical politics , the aim of its games is to highlight what its creators believe is most unfair about global capitalism and the modern labour market .
their online game , tamatipico , gives players their very own employee whom they have to keep happy to maintain production .

" we do n't think it 's enough to simply change the graphics ' look , or to change the characters in order to give a different message , " games designer paulo pedercini explained .
" the real meaning of a video , its ideology , is expressed mainly through the internal rules of the game , its structure and mechanisms . "
sombre simplicity this approach is best illustrated by another group from uruguay called newsgaming .
they have produced a shockwave-based game called september 12th .
in its frightening logic , players hunt down terrorists , but with clumsy missiles , collateral damage is impossible to avoid .
by contrast , their game madrid , if it can be called a game , is sombre in its simplicity .
the rules require players to click on the candles so they burn brighter .
but like all remembrance , the flames eventually fade .
the producers of these games are developing a sort of gaming counter-culture , seeing themselves as the latest in a line of political satirists playfully poking fun at passers-by or at those in power .
one of the main targets of such games is the us because of the internationalisation of its culture and more recently the war against terrorism .
but americans themselves , indeed none other than the republican party , are using video games to score political points .
the republicans ' version of space invaders is tax invaders .
it depicts republican president george w bush as the only hope in the battle against high taxes .
video games are normally a form of escape , a way to tune out from the troubles of the world .
however , the producers of this new breed of game have shown they can also act as an effective vehicle for political expression .

it follows a warning from cardinal keith o 'brien that the scottish executive faces a massive revolt over the strategy .
he claimed it would mean detailed sex education for nursery pupils and wider access to contraception .
first minister jack mcconnell said that no such plans have been put in place .
but the mab said it shared the same concerns as the cardinal .
osama saeed , the association 's scottish spokesperson , said : " there is a feeling that morals have been eroded unchecked for too many years and it is welcome that a proper debate be had about what is healthy in regards to the education of our children and how our future generations will be shaped .
" we look forward to supporting cardinal o 'brien in his efforts to defeat these proposals in the coming period . "
consultation document : enhancing sexual wellbeing in scotland mr mcconnell said : " there is no suggestion that there should be sex education for very young children in scotland and it is wrong to suggest that is the case . "
he also said there was no truth in the claims that the executive would hand out the morning after pill in scotland 's schools .
the cardinal has appealed to the executive to reject any approach which targets primary and pre-school children and he said any strategy which does , amounts to " child abuse " .
a consultation by the executive on sex education plans ends next month .
sex education the cardinal suggests that we are going to have sex education for under fives which i can absolutely guarantee any parent that is simply not going to happen jack mcconnell first minister a sexual health strategy will then be drawn up by health minister malcolm chisholm .
in the sunday times newspaper , the cardinal said that if sex education plans were introduced to nursery and primary children , parents in the roman catholic church would revolt .
he warned that the issue could become bigger than the section 28 debate over the issue of teaching about homosexuality in schools .
he told the newspaper : " the section 28 debate could become a mere flicker compared to the protests of parents determined to preserve their children 's innocence and protect their childhood .
" parents are rightly appalled at the idea of pre-pubescent , far less pre-school children , being provided with graphic and intimate sexual instruction .
" should such material be used it would amount to the state sponsored sexual abuse of minors . "
the church is already in discussion with other religious bodies to present a united front against the proposals .
and the cardinal will be asking catholic head teachers to oppose the strategy as well as ask the public to write to their msps .
' great ambassador ' mr mcconnell said : " i want to reassure everybody that any policy that is introduced in scotland will be based firmly , fundamentally at its very core on respect between young boys and girls , on teaching youngsters to respect each other .
" it will encourage them to have decent relationships and teach them that it is not necessary in order to have a good relationship as a teenager to get involved in sexual activity . "
he added : " i have a great respect for cardinal o 'brien , i think he is a great ambassador for scotland and he is a great leader of scotland 's roman catholics .
" he mentions the morning after pill being given to teenagers .
but we have made it absolutely clear that must not happen in schools to those who are under that age of 16 and that is a policy that is being properly administered across scotland .
" he also suggests that we are going to have sex education for under fives which i can absolutely guarantee any parent that is simply not going to happen . "

the new job of bin inspector at mansfield district council in notts has been taken by alan wilson .
he will join rubbish lorry crews but instead of throwing wheelie bin contents into the carts he will open them up and look inside .
he said : " this might not be everyone 's cup of tea but it is actually quite a challenge . "
mr wilson will check what residents in mansfield are putting in their green wheelie bins and in blue recycling bins - which are for plastic bottles , glass , cardboard and cans .
the aim of his job is to improve the recycling rate of the council .
putting the wrong kind of rubbish in bins can cause whole lorries of recyclable material being buried in the ground instead of being re-used .
mr wilson worked for the mansfield shoe company for 29 years until it closed earlier this year .
he has also been the pa announcer for mansfield football club for the past 15 years .
" i am checking for contamination and when i do find anything i will advise residents of where they are going wrong , " said mr wilson .

since then the family have been feeding the bird and the couple 's grandchildren jordan , paige and megan have a new pet .
the family are trying to find its owner but say if no-one comes forward they would like to keep the bird .
stan wainwright said : " we saw it monday morning .
it came through the paddock at the rear of the field . "
we would like to take it - my grandchildren love it " stan wainwright " we rang the police up but they did n't know anything about it .
" someone 's told us it could be a rhea of the ostrich family .
that is all we know about it . "
the wainwrights , who already keep 11 geese , have made appeals in local newspapers and on bbc radio nottingham to try to trace the owner but have not had any replies .
" it could have been abandoned , " said mr wainwright .
" if that is the case we would like to take it .
my grandchildren love it .
" we would keep it here as we have plenty of room . "

a colony of heath fritillary butterflies has been found on dunster heath .
but experts fear they may not settle and breed because a nearby conifer plantation blocks out too much light .
so staff from defra will clear 20 acres of trees over the coming months , the government department said .
the heath fritillary , distinguished by its dusky wing colours , is restricted to a few specialised habitats .
it flies close to the ground and has historically been linked with the traditional practice of woodland coppicing .
it is now one of britain 's rarest butterflies .
