graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .

" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress .
-lrb- march 9 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .
if he does n't get elected for a third term in 2006 , then schröder might just see himself forced to become an ordinary citizen again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a man to dye for german chancellor gerhard schröder has taken a news agency to court over the color of his hair .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.04.2004 pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welteke now regrets his actions .
amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .
whether it 's illegal is secondary . finding enlightenment in the loo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , russia german graffiti researcher axel thiel has concentrated on the constantly changing medium of street art for nearly 30 years .
the 55-year-old observes the scene with " interest from above , " as he put it . " i hit on it when i was sitting on the toilet at the university of kassel and saw all the graffiti . "
since that scatological epiphany he has been documenting , archiving and trying to " objectivize " the street art discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghent , belgium thiel vehemently opposes " criminalizing " the " young , highly-creative " street art scene , whether the people pasting stickers or spraying words or images .
in the end , it only serves the " paint industry . "
thiel reckons that $ 70 billion per year are spent on removing graffiti worldwide . cheaper than spraying thiel also sees the turn to stickers as a reaction to pressure from criminal prosecution .
graffiti sprayers have faced claims for compensation of up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- .
" someone who gets caught gluing can expect much more harmless prosecution , " thiel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian hundertmark , otherwise known as c100 one of these artists is c100 , alias christian hundertmark -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2003 , he published the first book about the new enthusiasm for pasting posters .
" the art of rebellion " introduces portraits of the work of 70 of the sometimes publicity-shy artists , most of whom work under a pseudonym .
they are between 29 and 35 years old , and most are former sprayers who searched for a new form of expression and found one . hundertmark , 29 , is one of these " grown-up " graffiti artists himself .
he 's even a sort of prototype of the sticker artist : he studied graphic design , works for a munich graphic design agency and has few ideological fears of the " serious " art scene .
" those are perhaps the main differences to graffiti - that everything is seen in a much more laid-back way and the people can do more than just spray their names , " he said . welcome success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg , germany despite the proud subversiveness , commercial success is also welcome .
recently " obey the giant , " one of the scene 's stars , was arrested for pasting stickers .
but the american 's work long ago found its way into upscale - and expensive - art galleries . " since the street art people are mainly already a bit older than 19 , they know how to brand themselves , " c100 says .
when it comes to success , hundertmark is n't entirely atypical either .
the first edition of his book has long been sold-out ; he has assembled a worldwide network ; and he 's now organizing an exhibition for galleries in london and munich . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2004 not all that 's " green " glitters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : german politicians greeted wijaya upon his arrival .
three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .

" the aim is to get a decision by the supreme court on whether u.s. courts are responsible for the examination of the detention of foreigners in the cuban camp , " kurnaz 's german lawyer bernhard docke explained .
docke , who has been representing kurnaz for the past two years , said the step , though unusual was necessary .
the court is set to take up the matter on april 20 , a decision is expected by the end of june .
kurnaz traveled in october 2001 from bremen to pakistan , where he was seized by the americans as an alleged taliban fighter .
the last that his family in bremen heard from him was a postcard in march 2002 .
the indefinite detention of hundreds of prisoners at guantanamo bay by the u.s. and their ambiguous legal situation has attracted worldwide criticism . more briefs 07.04.2004 -pipe- opposition : schröder indirectly responsible for iraq war 06.04.2004 -pipe- prosecutors investigate bundesbank scandal 06.04.2004 -pipe- court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

he even attempted some rud -lrb- e -rrb- imentary german . it was asking for trouble : take one american rapper with a penchant for scandal and offensive language and add one german television show which actively encourages such behavior as a form of entertainment .
the result ?
german viewers being treated to the sight of u.s. star eminem dropping his trousers and cursing , much to the delight of tv total presenter stefan raab . it all started so innocently , well , as innocently as it could possibly be when it comes to an appearance from the controversial rapper as his crew d12 .
after performing their latest single on the prosieben entertainment show , eminem turned his back to the cameras and nonchalantly dropped his baggy jeans , exposing his behind to an audience of millions .
sensing the chance to grab a slice of scandal for itself , tv total producers lingered on the rapper 's backside for a good few seconds before it was safely encased once more in denim . not content with one example of mr. mathers ' mooning skills , presenter raab then asked young marshall back to repeat the feat .
happy to oblige , eminem returned once more and repeated the airing of his nether regions for the german public .
this time however , obviously aware that a bit of a flash is nowhere near his usual standard of shocking behavior , the rapper accompanied his second performance with a tirade of abuse in the german tongue . reveling in the freedom that german television had afforded him in comparison to the restraint of tv in his home country , the american star later commented , " we love your country !

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .
whether it 's illegal is secondary . finding enlightenment in the loo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , russia german graffiti researcher axel thiel has concentrated on the constantly changing medium of street art for nearly 30 years .
the 55-year-old observes the scene with " interest from above , " as he put it . " i hit on it when i was sitting on the toilet at the university of kassel and saw all the graffiti . "
since that scatological epiphany he has been documenting , archiving and trying to " objectivize " the street art discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghent , belgium thiel vehemently opposes " criminalizing " the " young , highly-creative " street art scene , whether the people pasting stickers or spraying words or images .
in the end , it only serves the " paint industry . "
thiel reckons that $ 70 billion per year are spent on removing graffiti worldwide . cheaper than spraying thiel also sees the turn to stickers as a reaction to pressure from criminal prosecution .
graffiti sprayers have faced claims for compensation of up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- .
" someone who gets caught gluing can expect much more harmless prosecution , " thiel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian hundertmark , otherwise known as c100 one of these artists is c100 , alias christian hundertmark -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2003 , he published the first book about the new enthusiasm for pasting posters .
" the art of rebellion " introduces portraits of the work of 70 of the sometimes publicity-shy artists , most of whom work under a pseudonym .
they are between 29 and 35 years old , and most are former sprayers who searched for a new form of expression and found one . hundertmark , 29 , is one of these " grown-up " graffiti artists himself .
he 's even a sort of prototype of the sticker artist : he studied graphic design , works for a munich graphic design agency and has few ideological fears of the " serious " art scene .
" those are perhaps the main differences to graffiti - that everything is seen in a much more laid-back way and the people can do more than just spray their names , " he said . welcome success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg , germany despite the proud subversiveness , commercial success is also welcome .
recently " obey the giant , " one of the scene 's stars , was arrested for pasting stickers .
but the american 's work long ago found its way into upscale - and expensive - art galleries . " since the street art people are mainly already a bit older than 19 , they know how to brand themselves , " c100 says .
when it comes to success , hundertmark is n't entirely atypical either .
the first edition of his book has long been sold-out ; he has assembled a worldwide network ; and he 's now organizing an exhibition for galleries in london and munich . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .

man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .

he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .

he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .
if he does n't get elected for a third term in 2006 , then schröder might just see himself forced to become an ordinary citizen again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a man to dye for german chancellor gerhard schröder has taken a news agency to court over the color of his hair .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

" but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .

" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .

" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.04.2004 gerhard schröder : from rags to political riches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drive and single-minded ambition got him to the top .
german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress .
-lrb- march 9 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.04.2004 pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welteke now regrets his actions .
amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

" the aim is to get a decision by the supreme court on whether u.s. courts are responsible for the examination of the detention of foreigners in the cuban camp , " kurnaz 's german lawyer bernhard docke explained .
docke , who has been representing kurnaz for the past two years , said the step , though unusual was necessary .
the court is set to take up the matter on april 20 , a decision is expected by the end of june .
kurnaz traveled in october 2001 from bremen to pakistan , where he was seized by the americans as an alleged taliban fighter .
the last that his family in bremen heard from him was a postcard in march 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2004 challenging the european language elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odd man out : gerhard schröder tunes into chirac and blair 's unwillingness to speak german .
the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?
dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .

bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .

" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.04.2004 the man behind the chancellorship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marriage # 4 - not a political liability , it would seem .
four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .
if he does n't get elected for a third term in 2006 , then schröder might just see himself forced to become an ordinary citizen again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a man to dye for german chancellor gerhard schröder has taken a news agency to court over the color of his hair .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "

this comment was described as " stunning in its hypocrisy " by the party of the european socialists , which criticized the recent deal made between the epp and its eurosceptic wing , the british conservatives , which allows the latter to pursue their anti-european agenda .
this deal is currently subject to an examination in the european parliament , after socialist leader , enrique barón crespo asked the european parliament president pat cox to check whether it was in conformity with rules which state that political groups can be formed by members who have " political affinity . "
this rule ensures that groups are not just formed to be entitled to funding or receive staff , but share common political values and goals .
whether the deal struck by the epp is legitimate will be known later on this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.04.2004 pressure mounts on bank chief to quit over perks scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welteke now regrets his actions .
amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

he even attempted some rud -lrb- e -rrb- imentary german . it was asking for trouble : take one american rapper with a penchant for scandal and offensive language and add one german television show which actively encourages such behavior as a form of entertainment .
the result ?
german viewers being treated to the sight of u.s. star eminem dropping his trousers and cursing , much to the delight of tv total presenter stefan raab . it all started so innocently , well , as innocently as it could possibly be when it comes to an appearance from the controversial rapper as his crew d12 .
after performing their latest single on the prosieben entertainment show , eminem turned his back to the cameras and nonchalantly dropped his baggy jeans , exposing his behind to an audience of millions .
sensing the chance to grab a slice of scandal for itself , tv total producers lingered on the rapper 's backside for a good few seconds before it was safely encased once more in denim . not content with one example of mr. mathers ' mooning skills , presenter raab then asked young marshall back to repeat the feat .
happy to oblige , eminem returned once more and repeated the airing of his nether regions for the german public .
this time however , obviously aware that a bit of a flash is nowhere near his usual standard of shocking behavior , the rapper accompanied his second performance with a tirade of abuse in the german tongue . reveling in the freedom that german television had afforded him in comparison to the restraint of tv in his home country , the american star later commented , " we love your country !

" the aim is to get a decision by the supreme court on whether u.s. courts are responsible for the examination of the detention of foreigners in the cuban camp , " kurnaz 's german lawyer bernhard docke explained .
docke , who has been representing kurnaz for the past two years , said the step , though unusual was necessary .
the court is set to take up the matter on april 20 , a decision is expected by the end of june .
kurnaz traveled in october 2001 from bremen to pakistan , where he was seized by the americans as an alleged taliban fighter .
the last that his family in bremen heard from him was a postcard in march 2002 .
the indefinite detention of hundreds of prisoners at guantanamo bay by the u.s. and their ambiguous legal situation has attracted worldwide criticism . more briefs 07.04.2004 -pipe- opposition : schröder indirectly responsible for iraq war 06.04.2004 -pipe- prosecutors investigate bundesbank scandal 06.04.2004 -pipe- court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2004 not all that 's " green " glitters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : german politicians greeted wijaya upon his arrival .
three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress .
-lrb- march 9 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

" the aim is to get a decision by the supreme court on whether u.s. courts are responsible for the examination of the detention of foreigners in the cuban camp , " kurnaz 's german lawyer bernhard docke explained .
docke , who has been representing kurnaz for the past two years , said the step , though unusual was necessary .
the court is set to take up the matter on april 20 , a decision is expected by the end of june .
kurnaz traveled in october 2001 from bremen to pakistan , where he was seized by the americans as an alleged taliban fighter .
the last that his family in bremen heard from him was a postcard in march 2002 .
the indefinite detention of hundreds of prisoners at guantanamo bay by the u.s. and their ambiguous legal situation has attracted worldwide criticism . more briefs 07.04.2004 -pipe- opposition : schröder indirectly responsible for iraq war 06.04.2004 -pipe- prosecutors investigate bundesbank scandal 06.04.2004 -pipe- court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .

" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .

inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .

fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .

the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .

these include the regional chairmanship of the spd , the office of development senator of berlin as well as elector for the upcoming presidential elections .
the 51-year-old said the move was n't an admission of guilt , but rather was necessary to limit further damage to the city of berlin .
berlin 's public prosecutor is currently investigating strieder for his role in the controversial financing of a berlin entertainment center , the tempodrom .
strieder , together with berlin 's finance secretary thilo sarrazin , is suspected of having authorized the channeling of millions of city funds towards the tempodrom without a corresponding permission from the city state 's parliament .
a lawyer and former mayor of the berlin district of kreuzberg , strieder has led the berlin spd since 1999 . more briefs 07.04.2004 -pipe- lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court 07.04.2004 -pipe- opposition : schröder indirectly responsible for iraq war 06.04.2004 -pipe- prosecutors investigate bundesbank scandal 06.04.2004 -pipe- court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

he even attempted some rud -lrb- e -rrb- imentary german . it was asking for trouble : take one american rapper with a penchant for scandal and offensive language and add one german television show which actively encourages such behavior as a form of entertainment .
the result ?
german viewers being treated to the sight of u.s. star eminem dropping his trousers and cursing , much to the delight of tv total presenter stefan raab . it all started so innocently , well , as innocently as it could possibly be when it comes to an appearance from the controversial rapper as his crew d12 .
after performing their latest single on the prosieben entertainment show , eminem turned his back to the cameras and nonchalantly dropped his baggy jeans , exposing his behind to an audience of millions .
sensing the chance to grab a slice of scandal for itself , tv total producers lingered on the rapper 's backside for a good few seconds before it was safely encased once more in denim . not content with one example of mr. mathers ' mooning skills , presenter raab then asked young marshall back to repeat the feat .
happy to oblige , eminem returned once more and repeated the airing of his nether regions for the german public .
this time however , obviously aware that a bit of a flash is nowhere near his usual standard of shocking behavior , the rapper accompanied his second performance with a tirade of abuse in the german tongue . reveling in the freedom that german television had afforded him in comparison to the restraint of tv in his home country , the american star later commented , " we love your country !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2004 not all that 's " green " glitters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : german politicians greeted wijaya upon his arrival .
three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .
if he does n't get elected for a third term in 2006 , then schröder might just see himself forced to become an ordinary citizen again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a man to dye for german chancellor gerhard schröder has taken a news agency to court over the color of his hair .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .

" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .

expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .

bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

-lrb- february 24 , 2004 -rrb- deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

" but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .
whether it 's illegal is secondary . finding enlightenment in the loo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , russia german graffiti researcher axel thiel has concentrated on the constantly changing medium of street art for nearly 30 years .
the 55-year-old observes the scene with " interest from above , " as he put it . " i hit on it when i was sitting on the toilet at the university of kassel and saw all the graffiti . "
since that scatological epiphany he has been documenting , archiving and trying to " objectivize " the street art discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghent , belgium thiel vehemently opposes " criminalizing " the " young , highly-creative " street art scene , whether the people pasting stickers or spraying words or images .
in the end , it only serves the " paint industry . "
thiel reckons that $ 70 billion per year are spent on removing graffiti worldwide . cheaper than spraying thiel also sees the turn to stickers as a reaction to pressure from criminal prosecution .
graffiti sprayers have faced claims for compensation of up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- .
" someone who gets caught gluing can expect much more harmless prosecution , " thiel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian hundertmark , otherwise known as c100 one of these artists is c100 , alias christian hundertmark -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2003 , he published the first book about the new enthusiasm for pasting posters .
" the art of rebellion " introduces portraits of the work of 70 of the sometimes publicity-shy artists , most of whom work under a pseudonym .
they are between 29 and 35 years old , and most are former sprayers who searched for a new form of expression and found one . hundertmark , 29 , is one of these " grown-up " graffiti artists himself .
he 's even a sort of prototype of the sticker artist : he studied graphic design , works for a munich graphic design agency and has few ideological fears of the " serious " art scene .
" those are perhaps the main differences to graffiti - that everything is seen in a much more laid-back way and the people can do more than just spray their names , " he said . welcome success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg , germany despite the proud subversiveness , commercial success is also welcome .
recently " obey the giant , " one of the scene 's stars , was arrested for pasting stickers .
but the american 's work long ago found its way into upscale - and expensive - art galleries . " since the street art people are mainly already a bit older than 19 , they know how to brand themselves , " c100 says .
when it comes to success , hundertmark is n't entirely atypical either .
the first edition of his book has long been sold-out ; he has assembled a worldwide network ; and he 's now organizing an exhibition for galleries in london and munich . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .

the german government is pushing for the german language to be accepted as an official european union tongue as expansion nears and the number of german-speaking citizens in the eu is set to grow . the american writer mark twain once wrote that a gifted person could learn english in 30 hours , french in 30 days and german in 30 years .
" if it is to remain as it is , " twain wrote about the german language , " it ought to be gently and reverently set aside amongst the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
the government in berlin does not agree .
with the european union set to expand by a further 10 nations at the beginning of may , germany 's leaders see an opportunity to spread the word that german is a spoken language worthy of the second spot behind english as the eu 's lingua franca .
the federal government is preparing to make a very strong case for german to be one of the european " super-tongues " with an impressive array of statistics and the support of committed linguists to shore up the bid for recognition at eu level .
in a resolution last thursday , the bundestag or the lower house of parliament called on the government to push for german as a third principal eu language .
a similar resolution was passed in the bundesrat or upper house last month .
expansion brings more germans speakers to the eu german is the world 's 12th most widely spoken language and the most prevalent in europe after russian , with some 100 million native speakers .
when the eu expands to 25 states in may , the new members will bring many more german-speaking citizens into the fold .
in the ten accession countries joining the eu on may 1 , german is spoken by twice as many people as french .
however , english remains the second language of the majority of those joining .
within the existing 15-member bloc , german is the native language of nearly one in four people , eclipsing english , french and italian , which are spoken by only 16 percent each .
however , the task of convincing the european union to upgrade german to the status of official eu language will be a difficult one .
german has long been dogged by an image problem due to the complexity of its structure , the seemingly tough grammar and the harsh sounds of its words .
german is also far from being used , like english , at the workplace worldwide .
bloc legislators favor english and french for some in germany it is clear that the european union is settled on english and french as the main languages in the bloc despite the evidence that shows the surprising reach of german among the new states .
olav gutting , a legislator who campaigns for his native tongue , has lamented that only three percent of the bloc 's external communications is published in german , despite germans comprising the biggest group in the european parliament .
professor rudolf horberg , chairman of the society for the german language , agreed it was no good trying to beat english but german could position itself as a second foreign language of choice , especially in new eu countries .
" we 're living in a globalized world , we need a common language and english is it , " he told the afp news agency .
" in france they have an illusion that it could be french , but that time has long gone . "
he said his main concern for german was in science .
" if a scientist thinks he 's discovered something , or wants to say something , he does it in english , otherwise it would n't even be read . "
however a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry was quick to stifle any talk of a language battle at the eu .
" we do n't see german to be in competition with english , " the spokesperson told afp .
" learning a language is a way toward mutual understanding of two worlds , two cultures . "
but it seems that those germans who are willing to promote their language on an eu level are prepared to put up a good fight and have a growing army of supporters elsewhere in the world .
a recent government study shows that 20 million people abroad are currently learning german , a sign that there are people who are willing to take up the language challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should german be cleansed of " denglish " ?

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .
experts believe that the bank 's executive board now needs to speedily clear up the case in order to limit the amount of damage it might wreck on the bank 's image .
but that is not likely to prove easy .
for while the bundesbank 's employment contract requires board members to behave ethically , there is no explicit code of conduct .
the bank has also said that welteke could not have breached the so-called civil-service law , barring the acceptance of gifts , because he was technically not a civil servant .
however , as member of the governing council of the european central bank , welteke has to toe the ecb ethics code , which clearly stipulates that members can not accept benefits , rewards , remunerations or gifts in excess of a customary or negligible amount .
scandal stokes public anger the perks scandal has also touched a raw nerve in germany , where public anger is mounting over reports of corporate kickback and massive executive bonuses .
recently chancellor gerhard schröder also lashed out against greedy top managers in response to the mannesmann case over multi-million euro corporate payouts .
even as calls grow louder for welteke 's resignation , economists have begun speculating about successors with caio koch-weser , deputy finance minister , and ingrid matthäus-maier , board member at development bank kfw tipped as possible candidates . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann trial edges closer to collapse a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator .

amid a legal probe and media hostility , calls are growing louder for germany 's embattled bundesbank chief ernst welteke to resign over his acceptance of a luxury hotel stay paid for by a bank he regulates . speculation is mounting in germany that the corporate hospitality scandal concerning bundesbank president ernst welteke , the highest-paid civil servant -lrb- € 350,000 or $ 423,000 yearly -rrb- in the country , could finally claim his scalp .
on wednesday , the executive board of the bundesbank is to meet to decide the future of their president . welteke , a respected central banker and a member of the governing council of the european central bank , is under fire for the acceptance of controversial perks two years ago . the scandal first came to light when news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that welteke had spent four nights with his family in berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel during celebrations of the euro 's launch on january 1 , 2002 at the invitation of the dresdner bank . he seems to have ignored potential conflicts of interest given that the bundesbank is one of the bodies that regulates the commercial german banking sector .
the dresdner bank picked up the € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- hotel bill . under fire from all sides welteke initially reacted angrily to the allegations , countering that his conduct could in no way be deemed improper and instead accused the media of " criticism and misunderstandings . " but he has since changed his stance believed to be prompted by an increasingly hostile media , an apparent lack of political backing and the initiation of a legal probe into the matter by frankfurt 's public prosecutor . the country 's mass-selling bild tabloid on tuesday cheekily offered to pay welteke and his family to spend two weeks in majorca if he agreed to resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel even politicians of the ruling social democratic party , of which welteke is a member , have withheld their support for him .
german finance minister hans eichel said it was up to the bundesbank to review the case , but added that the conduct would have been unacceptable if welteke had been a government minister . on wednesday , a government spokesman also indirectly hinted that welteke 's resignation might be the right thing to do .
" it 's understandable and appropriate if welteke publicly asks himself whether he can expose his family , himself , his office and the institution of the bundesbank to further public debate , " thomas steg told reporters , referring to earlier remarks made by welteke . welteke adopts contrite tone welteke has since paid back the dresdner bank for two nights of the stay , while the bundesbank has footed the remaining costs .
the banker has also confirmed that he , his wife and their three-year-old son , as well as his 25-year-old son and his son 's girlfriend , had stayed in the hotel . on tuesday , welteke issued an extensive apology and said he had asked the bundesbank to look into the case " comprehensively " and " without prejudice . "
the banker added , " i deeply regret that in connection with the invitation by dresdner bank and my first reaction to public commentary about it , the impression has arisen that i would not abide by the high standards to which the bundesbank is obligated as a n independent institution . "
controversy threatens bundesbank image the scandal however has deeply embarrassed the bundesbank , which has a reputation for independence from the government and the other commercial banks it regulates .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed .

three years ago , indonesian-born harianto wijaya was the first to come to germany with a special green card for highly-skilled computer experts .
now - disappointed - he 's leaving .
deutsche welle spoke with him . in august 2001 , 25-year-old-indonesian-born harianto wijaya arrived in germany to much fanfare .
newspaper photographers were on hand to capture the moment , as german politicians greeted wijaya personally , shaking his hand and smiling pretty for the cameras .
he was the first foreigner to arrive in germany as part of a special program to give 20,000 highly skilled computer and technology experts green cards .
" i feel totally happy , " said wijaya , who studied in germany .
german chancellor gerhard schröder got the ball rolling in 2000 , when he proposed the scheme to attract skilled workers from abroad .
at the time , the computer sector was booming , and experts estimated an additional 70,000 workers would be needed to keep it going - a demand the home-grown german labor market could not meet .
thus , thousands would be recruited from oversees , namely from asian cities like bangalore , india .
" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .

" the chance of a lifetime , " proclaimed billboards advertising the program . the it sector falls on hard times in the first three years of the program , an estimated 15,000 it-specialists took germany up on its offer .
but the euphoria soon passed .
the technology sector fell on hard times , and that also affected the green card holders .
in a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs , many lost their jobs .
in fact , in munich , a city with a heavy concentration of tech companies , one in seven green card holders became unemployed . there 's the rub : without a job , green card holders were not granted residency .
sadly , many soon learned this first hand .
fortunately for wijaya , he was spared .
his company , a small software firm , was a success , thanks partly to his hard work .
but now wijaya is facing another problem many green card holders are familiar with : his original green card was limited to five years , and five years only .
that means wijaya , despite his contributions to the germany economy , will have to pack his bags . sorry , but five year 's the deal harianto wijaya also finished his ph.d. while living in germany , but he wo n't be able to apply the added expertise to the benefit of a germany company .
" all you get is five years , " he now says with resignation .
" when people like me , work for three years in research , and then realize they 'll have to leave , that hurts a little . " five years and not a day more - that was not how things were supposed to be .
the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens planned to push through a sweeping new immigration law in 2001 , which included provisions allowing the green card holders to extend their stay in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency . however , the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament representing the states and dominated by the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition , rejected the legislation in june , sending representatives from both sides of the political spectrum back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise .
months later , they are still working on it , and the highly sensitive issue has proven to be a political minefield . off to america even if , as hoped , the governing coalition and opposition manage to reach a compromise soon , it will be too late for harianto wijaya .
he 's already packed his bags and applied for another green card , this one an unlimited one for the united states . " i have to laugh , because i studied in germany and made it all the way to finishing a ph.d. , " he says .
" i also have german work experience , and now with this german work experience , i 'll have an easier time finding work in the u.s. , as the americans respect the germans .
so , maybe i wo n't cry about it , but i am disappointed . " meanwhile , wijaya 's green card has become a historical document and is archived at the german house of history -lrb- " haus der geschichte " -rrb- in bonn - a symbol of missed opportunity . sybille golte -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german immigration talks to include security concerns german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress .
-lrb- march 9 , 2004 -rrb- german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .
-lrb- june 20 , 2003 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.04.2004 gerhard schröder : from rags to political riches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drive and single-minded ambition got him to the top .
german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .
schröder has denied it , saying he will continue the course and even seek a third term in 2006 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no respite in sight for german chancellor there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

german chancellor gerhard schröder turns 60 on wednesday and can look back on an astoundingly successful rise to the political peak that could have been pulled from the pages of a novel .
the story 's end is less certain . in one of the better known anecdotes about gerhard schröder , the ambitious young politician is climbing up on the railing outside the chancellery of the then-capital bonn - perhaps after a drink or two nearby - while shouting " i want to get in there ! "
the story , whether true or apocryphal , illustrates well the fact that schröder has made it to the very top of german politics , and indeed , into the chancellery , thanks to driving ambition and single-minded purpose .
this is not a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth and groomed for greatness from early on .
in fact , his childhood and upbringing were anything but auspicious .
difficult start he was born on april 7 , 1944 , in mossenberg , in lower saxony , into war and biting poverty .
his father , who he never met , was an unskilled laborer who was killed in romania while serving in the german army .
his mother , a cleaning woman , had six children to raise and little money to do it with .
breaking out of that world was not easy .
after schröder graduated from secondary school he worked in a hardware shop and as a construction worker .
determined to make a name for himself , he later went back to night school to get his abitur , the degree which would enable him to attend university .
he enrolled at the university of göttingen in 1966 and got his law degree in 1970 .
he opened a law practice in hanover in 1976 .
influenced by the strong social democratic ideals of his mother and his idol , social democrat and german chancellor willy brandt , schröder began to get more involved in party politics , although he had already joined the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in 1963 .
in 1978 , he became head of its youth organization , the young socialists .
for a time , he embraced leftist politics and causes , making a name for himself as a defender of then left-wing terrorist horst mahler and taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
but it was also during this time that schröder began to develop a penchant for cigars and expensive suits , qualities that earned him little admiration from more left-leaning members of the spd . but such tastes coincided with his journey from the left wing to a more centrist position within the party .
in 1980 he was elected to the german parliament and in 1986 , he became head of the spd parliamentary group in the state legislature in lower saxony .
" comrade boss " during the next four years , schröder learned how to maneuver through the halls of power , and how to package political content for easy media consumption - skills that turned out to be essential to his later success .
in 1990 , he unexpectedly defeated ernst albrecht , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , who was weakened by scandal .
during his two-term leadership , schröder put such a stamp on the state that even today , he is indelibly linked with it .
while he governed for a while with the environmentalist green party , the always independent schröder was not shy about sidling up to business interests .
he had many friends among the heads of corporate germany - in the automotive and steel industries , shipyards , airlines and utilities .
that , along with his slick media savvy and roguish charm - not to mention the expensive cigars - earned him the distrust of the spd 's left wing and his one-time coalition partners , the greens .
he earned a reputation as a narcissist and some spd members derided him as " comrade boss . "
new middle schröder went on to conquer the chancellery in 1998 , promising to end 16 years of " stagnation " under helmut kohl and to rule from the " new middle , " a version of the third way made popular by former u.s. president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair .
his first four years in office , however , were mixed in terms of success .
he had the misfortune to be in the driver 's seat during the global economic downturn after the strong growth of the late 1990 's .
he could not fulfil his promise of creating more jobs during his first term and at the time of his re-election campaign , the german jobless rate had topped four million .
but he did manage to eke out a re-election victory - if only by the skin of his teeth - in 2002 , thanks largely to devastating floods in eastern germany one month before the election and his strong opposition to the pending iraq war .
still , at times it appears that schröder enjoys focusing on global affairs instead of messy domestic problems , like welfare and labor reform .
as the first german chancellor to grow up after world war ii , schröder has not been afraid to push for a more active role for germany on the world stage .
he openly opposed long-time ally the united states by refusing to support the invasion of iraq , and he is now campaigning for a permanent seat on the united nations security council for germany , something that none of his predecessors would have ever considered doing .
charmed life over ?
however , two years into his second term , schröder is facing near record low popularity levels and his party is losing members as he 's been hit by a stubborn economic slowdown and a series of reform measures that is proving unpopular with grassroots members of his own spd .
he recently handed over the leadership of the party to a deputy who enjoys more support from the rank and file .
media reports often speculate if schröder 's charmed political trajectory has reached its apogee and if the besieged chancellor might be considering leaving his post before his term is up .

in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .

it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .

four wives , three divorces , media flaps about hair dye and marital discord - chancellor gerhard schröder 's soap opera personal life sometimes threatens to overshadow his activities in office .
germans do n't seem to care . in the united states , bill clinton 's brief dalliance with intern monica lewinsky came close to costing him his office .
in germany , the populace elected a man to lead their country who had left his wife for a woman 19 years his junior .
it happened in 1997 , when gerhard schröder , then premier of the state of lower saxony , was thrown out of the house by wife number three , hilu .
he had just admitted to her that he had been having an affair for eight weeks with a journalist in munich .
that woman , doris köpf , became wife number four .
schröder 's private life has been remarkable , or as some might see it , remarkably messy .
his childhood was poor and he had to go to work at an early age , only finishing his secondary education at night .
still , his determination and drive helped him climb steadily up the ranks of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , finally winning the chancellorship in 1998 .
but on the way , he divorced three times , alienated many in his own party , and gained the reputation of a man driven by polls and popularity rather than by principle .
man of the media he learned early on about the power of print and broadcast media and how to use it to package himself in a way appealing to voters , to test ideas and push national debates in the direction he wanted .
he works tirelessly on his image , according to jürgen hogrefe , who has written a biography of the german leader .
always the political animal , schröder even consulted manfred güllner of the forsa polling institute about whether the separation from his third wife hilu would hurt him politically .
only after güllner said it would n't did he go ahead and file for divorce . early in his career schröder realized that the way to break through and get to the top of the spd was to cause a commotion and get his name on the evening news .
in 1981 , he became the first member of parliament to deliver a speech without wearing a tie .
it caused a sensation .
" in a media democracy , it is not necessarily an insult to be called a ' media chancellor ' , " schröder said in hogrefe 's book .
but his media splashes are n't always positive ones .
in 2002 , schröder was outraged when the ddp news agency reported that he dyed his hair .
his lawyer demanded the agency retract the statement and ended up taking ddp to court .
in the end , schröder won , but in doing so he revealed that his skin was n't quite as thick as most thought it to be .
he tussled with the media later that year when a provincial newspaper reported that the marriage to dorris was going through some tough times .
the märkische oderzeitung reported that the chancellor and his wife were increasingly estranged and sleeping apart , despite their close political relationship .
schröder again went to court , claiming the paper was intruding into his private life .
man of the people despite his penchant for cigars and italian-made suits , schröder likes to cultivate the image of being a down-to-earth , hard-working man .
and , weighed down as he is with alimony payments to three ex-wives on a salary of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- a year , in fact schröder does n't have the money to play the high roller .
he spends his weekend driving around in an aging volkswagen , lives in an unspectacular townhouse in hanover when he 's not in the modest apartment in the chancellery in berlin , and puts doris on low-cost flights when they go on vacation .

graffiti is so yesterday .
these days any self-respecting metropolis has stickers and other types of " new street art " plastered everywhere . if you 've happened to walk through one the world 's leading cities recently , almost inevitably you 've noticed there 's been some serious redecorating : stickers and posters made of printed , sprayed or painted paper , seem to have spread like a bad rash all over electrical poles , walls and lamp posts .
dubbed " post-graffiti , " " urban art , " or " new street art , " the idea is to not just take a can of spray paint and leave your name somewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stockholm , sweden most culture gurus would agree that avant-garde art is meant to provoke , annoy , amuse or at least cause some sort of reaction .
inasmuch , street art could n't be more effective .
some city dwellers see stickers , as well as spray-painted graffiti , as simple defacement - or often as property damage that has to be removed at great expense and passed on for the police to follow up . but for practitioners of street art , it 's a -lrb- sub- -rrb- cultural freedom movement .
" reclaim the streets " is the classic slogan , tinged with a dash of anarchistic pathos . accordingly , most urban art guerillas believe their work should n't just lie dormant in museums and galleries .
instead it should be in public and freely accessible for everyone - and create a contrast to the images and messages of the advertising world .
whether it 's illegal is secondary . finding enlightenment in the loo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , russia german graffiti researcher axel thiel has concentrated on the constantly changing medium of street art for nearly 30 years .
the 55-year-old observes the scene with " interest from above , " as he put it . " i hit on it when i was sitting on the toilet at the university of kassel and saw all the graffiti . "
since that scatological epiphany he has been documenting , archiving and trying to " objectivize " the street art discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghent , belgium thiel vehemently opposes " criminalizing " the " young , highly-creative " street art scene , whether the people pasting stickers or spraying words or images .
in the end , it only serves the " paint industry . "
thiel reckons that $ 70 billion per year are spent on removing graffiti worldwide . cheaper than spraying thiel also sees the turn to stickers as a reaction to pressure from criminal prosecution .
graffiti sprayers have faced claims for compensation of up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- .
" someone who gets caught gluing can expect much more harmless prosecution , " thiel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian hundertmark , otherwise known as c100 one of these artists is c100 , alias christian hundertmark -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2003 , he published the first book about the new enthusiasm for pasting posters .
" the art of rebellion " introduces portraits of the work of 70 of the sometimes publicity-shy artists , most of whom work under a pseudonym .
they are between 29 and 35 years old , and most are former sprayers who searched for a new form of expression and found one . hundertmark , 29 , is one of these " grown-up " graffiti artists himself .
he 's even a sort of prototype of the sticker artist : he studied graphic design , works for a munich graphic design agency and has few ideological fears of the " serious " art scene .
" those are perhaps the main differences to graffiti - that everything is seen in a much more laid-back way and the people can do more than just spray their names , " he said . welcome success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiburg , germany despite the proud subversiveness , commercial success is also welcome .
recently " obey the giant , " one of the scene 's stars , was arrested for pasting stickers .
but the american 's work long ago found its way into upscale - and expensive - art galleries . " since the street art people are mainly already a bit older than 19 , they know how to brand themselves , " c100 says .
when it comes to success , hundertmark is n't entirely atypical either .
the first edition of his book has long been sold-out ; he has assembled a worldwide network ; and he 's now organizing an exhibition for galleries in london and munich . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .
exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors .
-lrb- feb .
17 , 2004 -rrb- government , opposition split over graffiti to some it ’ s art , to others it ’ s a nuisance .
to the opposition conservatives in germany ’ s lower chamber of parliament , the bundestag , graffiti is nothing less than a crime that needs a tough punishment .

one 44-year-old woman talks frankly to bbc news online 's lucy wallis about her battle with overeating , laxative abuse and how her obsession with food nearly killed her .
for me , compulsive overeating was like a slow suicide .
it would have been quicker if i had gone out and stood in front of a bus .
food can be massively addictive .
it 's a friend , a sedative .
when you 've done well , when you 've done badly , it 's always there for you .
i first remember becoming aware that i was overweight from the age of nine-years-old .
my family started to make comments about my size and did n't realise how devastated i felt .
i would binge on food until , by the age of 22 , i was a dress size 18-20 .
i 'm 5ft 6 .
i struggled to lose weight throughout my teenage years .
at 15-years-old , i started taking laxatives .
overdosing on laxatives has caused permanent irreversible damage to my bowel and i have been diagnosed with what 's called a spastic colon .
if ... we do n't stop eating is a bbc drama showing what may happen if we keep overeating wednesday , 7 april , 2004 at 2100 bst on bbc two despite seeing numerous medical experts , there is nothing that can be done to repair the damage and if i ever start to bleed internally i have to go straight to hospital as it could prove fatal .
compulsive overeating is a battle of wills between the mind and the body .
you become so mentally sick of food .
your body says one thing and your mind another .
one of them has to break down and if your mind wins , you end up bingeing on food .
fear and despair in my twenties , my overeating got worse .
i would binge on carrier bags full of food or would constantly graze on food throughout the day .
when i was bingeing i felt out of control , despair , fear and absolute incomprehension that i could do this .
you ruthlessly cram food into your mouth .
i am the type of person that could never eat just one chocolate from a box this cycle of bingeing meant i had become so ill that i had no social ability .
i was n't interested in relationships .
i lost my ambition and had to leave work because i was unable to concentrate and function properly .
i gave up a great career opportunity when i left work .
i also sold my car because i did n't have the nerve or the concentration to drive .
my family were devastated and could n't cope and my sisters withdrew from me .
i would throw my friends out of the house when they tried to help me .
food had become a master rather than a servant .
the illness had taken over and i had become a one person world , where all you can think about is yourself and the bingeing and obsessing .
i tried therapy and numerous diets throughout my life , but nothing seemed to work .
at the age of 30 , i was in total despair after all my failed efforts to control my eating .
i had to increase my use of laxatives as my bowel damage got worse and my weight dropped from 14 stone to six and a half stone .
this weight loss was only temporary and the emotional overeating shortly returned .
turning point i have been hospitalised a couple of times because i could not function properly .
i was also diagnosed with me or chronic fatigue syndrome , which i believe was made worse because my immune system had been so run down .
the turning point for me came when i suddenly realised you either die or get well .
you reach a point when you know food is killing you and you just want freedom .
you feel lonely , depressed , like you are sinking in quicksand .
i had a friend who was going to overeaters anonymous , a help group which offers a 12 step programme of recovery from compulsive overeating .
i do n't want to go back , but i know that door is always open i watched people i met there who had the strength not to binge and had achieved peace of mind .
i became willing to retrain my ideas about food and created set meal times at - 8am , 12pm , a snack at 4pm and a meal in the evening .
the philosophy is three meals and a life in-between .
it was hard to get from meal to meal at first without eating as food had become a drug to me , but now i do n't even need the 4pm snack .
i also now avoid trigger foods altogether , or foods that i ca n't resist , such as those with high levels of sugar in them .
i have an addictive personality and am the type of person that could never eat just one chocolate from a box .
you have to realise for yourself that something is wrong and that this is a progressive illness .
hope i now have n't binged for seven years .
i am a lot fitter and go swimming and play badminton .
i can go out for meals and go on holiday .
i am also now in my sixth year of a relationship and in full-time employment , which is nothing short of a miracle !
i do n't want to go back , but i know that door is always open .
i believe if the compulsive overeating came back it would take me for good this time .
everyone is aware that the problems with obesity are escalating at an alarming rate and there is great concern .
but there is hope that you can break the cycle and achieve piece of mind .
if you have been affected by the issues raised here , you can contact overeaters anonymous on 07000 784985 .

i also sold my car because i did n't have the nerve or the concentration to drive .
my family were devastated and could n't cope and my sisters withdrew from me .
i would throw my friends out of the house when they tried to help me .
food had become a master rather than a servant .
the illness had taken over and i had become a one person world , where all you can think about is yourself and the bingeing and obsessing .
i tried therapy and numerous diets throughout my life , but nothing seemed to work .
at the age of 30 , i was in total despair after all my failed efforts to control my eating .
i had to increase my use of laxatives as my bowel damage got worse and my weight dropped from 14 stone to six and a half stone .
this weight loss was only temporary and the emotional overeating shortly returned .
turning point i have been hospitalised a couple of times because i could not function properly .
i was also diagnosed with me or chronic fatigue syndrome , which i believe was made worse because my immune system had been so run down .
the turning point for me came when i suddenly realised you either die or get well .
you reach a point when you know food is killing you and you just want freedom .
you feel lonely , depressed , like you are sinking in quicksand .
i had a friend who was going to overeaters anonymous , a help group which offers a 12 step programme of recovery from compulsive overeating .
i do n't want to go back , but i know that door is always open i watched people i met there who had the strength not to binge and had achieved peace of mind .
i became willing to retrain my ideas about food and created set meal times at - 8am , 12pm , a snack at 4pm and a meal in the evening .
the philosophy is three meals and a life in-between .
it was hard to get from meal to meal at first without eating as food had become a drug to me , but now i do n't even need the 4pm snack .
i also now avoid trigger foods altogether , or foods that i ca n't resist , such as those with high levels of sugar in them .
i have an addictive personality and am the type of person that could never eat just one chocolate from a box .
you have to realise for yourself that something is wrong and that this is a progressive illness .
hope i now have n't binged for seven years .
i am a lot fitter and go swimming and play badminton .
i can go out for meals and go on holiday .
i am also now in my sixth year of a relationship and in full-time employment , which is nothing short of a miracle !
i do n't want to go back , but i know that door is always open .
i believe if the compulsive overeating came back it would take me for good this time .
everyone is aware that the problems with obesity are escalating at an alarming rate and there is great concern .
but there is hope that you can break the cycle and achieve piece of mind .

the town council believes large casino hotels could regenerate the resort .

captain albert armitage poured his thoughts into a diary during the voyage of the discovery to the antarctic from 1901 to 1904 .
in it he speaks of his enthusiasm early on for working with scott but later he writes of rivalry between them .
the book is now to be auctioned and a campaign launched to keep it in the uk .
rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in cambridge , is trying to raise the estimated £ 40,000 to keep the diary for future generations .
the book , still almost perfect inside , has been held privately for a century . "
in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional " rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in the diary captain armitage says he was proud to be serving under captain scott on their journey , fraught with danger and discovery , to the unknown continent .
" it is very agreeable to be associated with captain scott who is at once both clear-headed , amiable and considerate , " he wrote on 30 october 1902 .
later he recorded tense conversations with scott in minute detail , revealing a bitter rivalry between the two polar explorers .
" in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional , " mr headland said .
" he 's writing things as they occur at the time which , on reflection 24 hours or a week or so later , might be construed a little differently . "
rupert powell , of bloomsbury auctions , said he was not surprised by the interest the diary was generating .
" there are not a huge amount of works written about the antarctic - certainly not from the golden age back in the early 20th century . "
but the diarist has taken some of his secrets to his grave .
at one point he wrote : " when the captain went to turn in i went to the cabin to ask the reason for his unfriendly manner towards me .

captain albert armitage poured his thoughts into a diary during the voyage of the discovery to the antarctic from 1901 to 1904 .
in it he speaks of his enthusiasm early on for working with scott but later he writes of rivalry between them .
the book is now to be auctioned and a campaign launched to keep it in the uk .
rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in cambridge , is trying to raise the estimated £ 40,000 to keep the diary for future generations .
the book , still almost perfect inside , has been held privately for a century .
in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in the diary captain armitage says he was proud to be serving under captain scott on their journey , fraught with danger and discovery , to the unknown continent .
" it is very agreeable to be associated with captain scott who is at once both clear-headed , amiable and considerate , " he wrote on 30 october 1902 .
later he recorded tense conversations with scott in minute detail , revealing a bitter rivalry between the two polar explorers .
" in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional , " mr headland said .
" he 's writing things as they occur at the time which , on reflection 24 hours or a week or so later , might be construed a little differently . "
scott at mount erebus -lrb- image by scott polar research unit -rrb- rupert powell , of bloomsbury auctions , said he was not surprised by the interest the diary was generating .
" there are not a huge amount of works written about the antarctic - certainly not from the golden age back in the early 20th century . "
but the diarist has taken some of his secrets to his grave .
at one point he wrote : " when the captain went to turn in i went to the cabin to ask the reason for his unfriendly manner towards me .

captain albert armitage poured his thoughts into a diary during the voyage of the discovery to the antarctic from 1901 to 1904 .
in it he speaks of his enthusiasm early on for working with scott but later he writes of rivalry between them .
the book is now to be auctioned and a campaign launched to keep it in the uk .
rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in cambridge , is trying to raise the estimated £ 40,000 to keep the diary for future generations .
the book , still almost perfect inside , has been held privately for a century .
in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional rob headland , of the scott polar research institute in the diary captain armitage says he was proud to be serving under captain scott on their journey , fraught with danger and discovery , to the unknown continent .
" it is very agreeable to be associated with captain scott who is at once both clear-headed , amiable and considerate , " he wrote on 30 october 1902 .
later he recorded tense conversations with scott in minute detail , revealing a bitter rivalry between the two polar explorers .
" in such a case a diary tends to be almost a man 's confessional , " mr headland said .
" he 's writing things as they occur at the time which , on reflection 24 hours or a week or so later , might be construed a little differently . "
scott at mount erebus -lrb- image by scott polar research unit -rrb- rupert powell , of bloomsbury auctions , said he was not surprised by the interest the diary was generating .
" there are not a huge amount of works written about the antarctic - certainly not from the golden age back in the early 20th century . "
but the diarist has taken some of his secrets to his grave .
at one point he wrote : " when the captain went to turn in i went to the cabin to ask the reason for his unfriendly manner towards me .

for the first time in its 58 year history , the north wales festival 's turnover exceeded £ 1m last year .
in 2000 and 2001 the eisteddfod 's organisers had been operating at a financial loss .
the news comes days after wales ' national eisteddfod said it could be in jeopardy because of serious concern over its finances .
their shadow governing body met in aberystwyth on saturday and said this year 's festival in newport , south wales , was already showing signs of losing a large amount of money .
finances the festival is running at an annual loss of £ 130,000 .
organiser 's of the llangollen eisteddfod say in 2003 they had a surplus of £ 109,321 but as a charity this was not profit but money that will be re-invested into the festival .
they have managed to turn things around by staging more well-known artists such as shirley bassey .
their expenses have increased as a result but they are finding it easier to recoup the money .
" lesley garrett turned the eisteddfod around and then shirley bassey , " said spokesman nigel davies .
" the eisteddfod realised that you have to give people what they want to see ... -lsb- that means -rsb- going for the artists that will sell the tickets , " he added .
in 2000 the eisteddfod saw a net loss of £ 268,707 and 2001 saw a loss of £ 232,680 .
shirley bassey performed to a sell-out crowd in llangollen established in 1947 , the musical eisteddfod is one of the highlights of the welsh cultural calendar .
the july eisteddfod is a major event in the music calendar , attracting 80,000 visitors each year .
this year former choirboy aled jones will take to the stage for the first time in his 20-year career .
anglesey-born jones will appear on stage for the 58th festival with the opera babes on friday 9 july .
the week-long event starts on 6 july .
west end star michael ball , whose family roots are in the south wales valleys , will top the bill on 11 july , the final night of the event .
organisers say ticket sales are already outstripping those of 2003 which , in itself , was a record breaking year .

for the first time in its 58 year history , the north wales festival 's turnover exceeded £ 1m last year .
in 2000 and 2001 the eisteddfod 's organisers had been operating at a financial loss .
the news comes days after wales ' national eisteddfod said it could be in jeopardy because of serious concern over its finances .
their shadow governing body met in aberystwyth on saturday and said this year 's festival in newport , south wales , was already showing signs of losing a large amount of money .
finances the festival is running at an annual loss of £ 130,000 .
organiser 's of the llangollen eisteddfod say in 2003 they had a surplus of £ 109,321 but as a charity this was not profit but money that will be re-invested into the festival .
they have managed to turn things around by staging more well-known artists such as shirley bassey .
their expenses have increased as a result but they are finding it easier to recoup the money .
" lesley garrett turned the eisteddfod around and then shirley bassey , " said spokesman nigel davies .
" the eisteddfod realised that you have to give people what they want to see ... -lsb- that means -rsb- going for the artists that will sell the tickets , " he added .
in 2000 the eisteddfod saw a net loss of £ 268,707 and 2001 saw a loss of £ 232,680 .
established in 1947 , the musical eisteddfod is one of the highlights of the welsh cultural calendar .
the july eisteddfod is a major event in the music calendar , attracting 80,000 visitors each year .
this year former choirboy aled jones will take to the stage for the first time in his 20-year career .
anglesey-born jones will appear on stage for the 58th festival with the opera babes on friday 9 july .
the week-long event starts on 6 july .
west end star michael ball , whose family roots are in the south wales valleys , will top the bill on 11 july , the final night of the event .
organisers say ticket sales are already outstripping those of 2003 which , in itself , was a record breaking year .

a seacat catamaran has been chartered from hoverspeed to replace solidor 5 , which is being repaired .
the new vessel was due to be tested in island waters early this week , but it is still in belfast .
emeraude 's jersey manager , gordon forrest , says the boat 's rear doors have to be modified so it can dock properly in jersey and st malo .
costs dispute the 74m catamaran , which can carry 80 cars , had been due to arrive in jersey on monday and was expected to have its first sailing on wednesday .
solidor 5 has been held in cherbourg in a dispute over winter servicing costs .
the problems with the solidor 5 are the latest in a series of blows for emeraude , which was bought out last year by french firm sogestran .
then there were arguments over whether it owned the solidor 5 and the news that rival firm condor would be directly competing with it .
then the solidor 5 went in for its scheduled winter service , only to be held in cherbourg in a dispute over who pays for engine servicing next year .
emeraude put the solidor 4 back on the route , but that developed engine problems and its sailings were cancelled .

the new vessel was due to be tested in island waters early this week , but it is still in belfast .
emeraude 's jersey manager , gordon forrest , says the boat 's rear doors have to be modified so it can dock properly in jersey and st malo .
costs dispute the 74m catamaran , which can carry 80 cars , had been due to arrive in jersey on monday and was expected to have its first sailing on wednesday .
solidor 5 has been held in cherbourg in a dispute over winter servicing costs .
the problems with the solidor 5 are the latest in a series of blows for emeraude , which was bought out last year by french firm sogestran .
then there were arguments over whether it owned the solidor 5 and the news that rival firm condor would be directly competing with it .
then the solidor 5 went in for its scheduled winter service , only to be held in cherbourg in a dispute over who pays for engine servicing next year .
emeraude put the solidor 4 back on the route , but that developed engine problems and its sailings were cancelled .

" we have come to build a new country , " they chant , clapping and grinning .
these are some of the remnants of the hutu militias and former rwandan army that fled to neighbouring congo at the end of the genocide .
after spending up to 10 years in the jungles of eastern congo , fighting the rwandan government , they have now decided to lay down their weapons .
' miracle ' in mutobo , they will be taught about the new rwanda , about how hutus and tutsis can live together again .
then they will make the final stage of their journey back to their villages .
it is one of the signs how far rwanda has come , since the chaos that engulfed a decade ago . "
nobody would think that those who survived and those who connived with those committing genocide could live peacefully in rwanda - yet this is happening . "
rwanda 's foreign minister charles muligande " i would simply say that a miracle has happened in rwanda .
we have been able to bring back total security and peace , " says rwanda 's foreign minister charles muligande .
when the rebel rwandan patriotic front -lrb- rpf -rrb- took control of the country in 1994 , ending the genocide , the economy and infrastructure were in ruins .
an estimated 800,000 people , mostly tutsis , had been slaughtered .
three million hutu refugees fled to neighbouring countries , among them the perpetrators of the genocide , who turned themselves into a rebel force menacing rwanda 's borders .
today , the new government has made huge strides , mr muligande says , not just in rebuilding the country , but also in helping to reconcile its divided people .
" nobody would think that these two sections , those who survived and those who connived with those committing genocide , could live peacefully in rwanda .
and yet this is happening . "
restrictions the distance rwanda has travelled is remarkable in many ways .
while up to 20,000 hutu rebels remain in congo , 4,000 including their leader have now voluntarily disarmed . "
we do n't even have anything like an opposition here - we ca n't see people who can criticise government " newspaper editor robert sebufirira most refugees have come home and access to education and health services has rapidly increased .
a drive through the capital kigali shows the pace of change , compared with even just a few years ago .
new houses , modern office blocks and hotels are springing up .
but this progress comes at a price .
prominent critics of the government have been imprisoned or forced into exile , human rights groups say .
many rwandans are afraid to speak out against their government .
robert sebufirira , editor of umuseso , considered to be rwanda 's only independent newspaper , says despite last years multiparty elections , the ruling rpf so far remains the only political force .
" we do n't even have anything like an opposition here .
we ca n't see people who can criticise government , " he says .
' judge and jury ' for the rpf , rwanda 's violent recent history means democracy must be balanced with certain controls if further conflict is to be avoided .
the second largest party after the rpf was banned last year - accused of trying to promote ethnic divisions .
but critics say the rpf led government is using the past to justify a de facto one party state .
" as long as the rpf will be at the same time judge and jury , the accusations of divisive politics will lack credibility because it serves the interests of the government to say that their opponent is not following the rules , " says francois grignon , central africa director of the international crisis group .
he argues a more plural political system is now essential .
" when security is not now the issue which supersedes everything else , opening up becomes necessary in order to achieve genuine reconciliation . "
ethnic labels the extent to which real reconciliation has been achieved is disputed .
the government has made significant efforts to promote unity among tutsis and hutus .
and it believes these old ethnic labels are now being replaced by a single rwandan identity .
but ethnicity is still a potentially divisive issue .
as a rebel movement fighting the previous regime , the rpf had its base among tutsi exiles in neighbouring uganda .
and perceptions remain that the rpf led government is tutsi dominated .
" the tutsi occupy the most important positions in the army and in the civil administration - the ones with the real power .
" and they are the greatest beneficiaries of the important posts in the economy , " says alison des forges , senior adviser to human rights watch , and a long term researcher on rwanda .
there are fears that a sense of political and economic exclusion will lead to a growing resentment among hutus .
rural poverty but this is not the only challenge the government faces ten years on .
in the southern province of gikongoro , i meet yohanna nkuliye , planting potatoes .
it is a world away from the new office blocks in the capital . "
unless there is some way for voices of dissent to be legitimately expressed , the tendency to resort to violence will of course increase " alison des forges human rights watch adviser there are hundreds of tiny plots of land like his stretching along the valley .
yohanna 's father farmed this same land .
when he died it was divided between yohanna and his four brothers .
yohanna himself has six sons who have a claim on his farm .
" there are more people now and the soil is old .
that 's why we die of hunger .
the land is not enough for my family , " he says .
rwanda has more people per square km than any other african country .
and its increasing rural population , is farming progressively smaller parcels of land .
some analysts fear a potentially explosive mix - between this growing rural poverty and urban resentment at lack of political freedoms .
" unless there is some way for voices of dissent to be legitimately expressed , the tendency to resort to voice will of course increase .
" it could be violence within the elite itself in the form of a coup , or it could be violence in terms of a rural uprising , or an uprising in the city streets , " says alison des forges .
for many farmers like yohanna , the greatest achievement in the past 10 years has been peace and security .
for his children , and for the growing urban youth , expectations will be higher .
analysts suggest that the way in which the rpf government responds to demands for greater political freedom , and more equitably shared economic opportunities , will determine how far rwanda 's current stability is maintained in the long term .

" we have come to build a new country , " they chant , clapping and grinning .
these are some of the remnants of the hutu militias and former rwandan army that fled to neighbouring congo at the end of the genocide .
after spending up to 10 years in the jungles of eastern congo , fighting the rwandan government , they have now decided to lay down their weapons .
' miracle ' in mutobo , they will be taught about the new rwanda , about how hutus and tutsis can live together again .
then they will make the final stage of their journey back to their villages .
it is one of the signs how far rwanda has come , since the chaos that engulfed a decade ago .
nobody would think that those who survived and those who connived with those committing genocide could live peacefully in rwanda - yet this is happening .
rwanda 's foreign minister charles muligande " i would simply say that a miracle has happened in rwanda .
we have been able to bring back total security and peace , " says rwanda 's foreign minister charles muligande .
when the rebel rwandan patriotic front -lrb- rpf -rrb- took control of the country in 1994 , ending the genocide , the economy and infrastructure were in ruins .
an estimated 800,000 people , mostly tutsis , had been slaughtered .
three million hutu refugees fled to neighbouring countries , among them the perpetrators of the genocide , who turned themselves into a rebel force menacing rwanda 's borders .
today , the new government has made huge strides , mr muligande says , not just in rebuilding the country , but also in helping to reconcile its divided people .
" nobody would think that these two sections , those who survived and those who connived with those committing genocide , could live peacefully in rwanda .
and yet this is happening . "
restrictions the distance rwanda has travelled is remarkable in many ways .
while up to 20,000 hutu rebels remain in congo , 4,000 including their leader have now voluntarily disarmed .
we do n't even have anything like an opposition here - we ca n't see people who can criticise government newspaper editor robert sebufirira most refugees have come home and access to education and health services has rapidly increased .
a drive through the capital kigali shows the pace of change , compared with even just a few years ago .
new houses , modern office blocks and hotels are springing up .
but this progress comes at a price .
prominent critics of the government have been imprisoned or forced into exile , human rights groups say .
many rwandans are afraid to speak out against their government .
robert sebufirira , editor of umuseso , considered to be rwanda 's only independent newspaper , says despite last years multiparty elections , the ruling rpf so far remains the only political force .
" we do n't even have anything like an opposition here .
we ca n't see people who can criticise government , " he says .
' judge and jury ' for the rpf , rwanda 's violent recent history means democracy must be balanced with certain controls if further conflict is to be avoided .
the second largest party after the rpf was banned last year - accused of trying to promote ethnic divisions .
but critics say the rpf led government is using the past to justify a de facto one party state .
" as long as the rpf will be at the same time judge and jury , the accusations of divisive politics will lack credibility because it serves the interests of the government to say that their opponent is not following the rules , " says francois grignon , central africa director of the international crisis group .
he argues a more plural political system is now essential .
" when security is not now the issue which supersedes everything else , opening up becomes necessary in order to achieve genuine reconciliation . "
ethnic labels the extent to which real reconciliation has been achieved is disputed .
the government has made significant efforts to promote unity among tutsis and hutus .
rwanda has abolished all reference to ethnicity on identity cards and it believes these old ethnic labels are now being replaced by a single rwandan identity .
but ethnicity is still a potentially divisive issue .
as a rebel movement fighting the previous regime , the rpf had its base among tutsi exiles in neighbouring uganda .
and perceptions remain that the rpf led government is tutsi dominated .
" the tutsi occupy the most important positions in the army and in the civil administration - the ones with the real power .
" and they are the greatest beneficiaries of the important posts in the economy , " says alison des forges , senior adviser to human rights watch , and a long term researcher on rwanda .
there are fears that a sense of political and economic exclusion will lead to a growing resentment among hutus .
rural poverty but this is not the only challenge the government faces ten years on .
in the southern province of gikongoro , i meet yohanna nkuliye , planting potatoes .
it is a world away from the new office blocks in the capital .
unless there is some way for voices of dissent to be legitimately expressed , the tendency to resort to violence will of course increase alison des forges human rights watch adviser there are hundreds of tiny plots of land like his stretching along the valley .
yohanna 's father farmed this same land .
when he died it was divided between yohanna and his four brothers .
yohanna himself has six sons who have a claim on his farm .
" there are more people now and the soil is old .
that 's why we die of hunger .
the land is not enough for my family , " he says .
rwanda has more people per square km than any other african country .
and its increasing rural population , is farming progressively smaller parcels of land .
some analysts fear a potentially explosive mix - between this growing rural poverty and urban resentment at lack of political freedoms .
" unless there is some way for voices of dissent to be legitimately expressed , the tendency to resort to voice will of course increase .
" it could be violence within the elite itself in the form of a coup , or it could be violence in terms of a rural uprising , or an uprising in the city streets , " says alison des forges .
for many farmers like yohanna , the greatest achievement in the past 10 years has been peace and security .
for his children , and for the growing urban youth , expectations will be higher .
analysts suggest that the way in which the rpf government responds to demands for greater political freedom , and more equitably shared economic opportunities , will determine how far rwanda 's current stability is maintained in the long term .

wales ' children 's commissioner peter clarke is only able to intervene in devolved areas like health and education .
but his new english counterpart will have responsibility in wales for issues that are decided at westminster .
mps on the all-party welsh affairs committee fear the two roles will cause confusion .
due to the devolution settlement mr clarke is able only to intervene in areas which are the responsibility of the welsh assembly government .
the new english commissioner - however - will have responsibility in wales and the rest of the uk for children 's issues that are decided at westminster , issues relating to the probation service for example .
julie morgan mp is a member of the welsh affairs committee which reported to the government on this issue and fears that two separate roles would cause problems . "
having this confusion is a very bad move and we 've got to change it " julie morgan mp " the way the children 's bill is set out - the english commissioner will have responsibility for non-devolved matters , " she said .
" that means the english commissioner would operate in wales over those areas .
" that is a matter of great concern because i think what we have to look at is the most effective way of getting to young people who need help .
" and to have two people operating in wales is confusing and not on . "
the post of welsh children 's commissioner - to respond to complaints from children - was created after a report by sir ronald waterhouse in 2000 about the abuse of children and young people over a period of 20 years in homes across north wales .
two acts of parliament control the commissioner but he is independent from government .
in march mr clarke said he feared a similar role in england , could confuse and undermine his position .
" over three years now we 've been trying to build up a system so that children understand that their commissioner is a welsh commissioner - and i 'm there for them , " he said at the time .
" suddenly we are going to have to tell them - ' well , actually no , it 's the english commissioner you want for this thing or that thing ' . "
the government at westminster has rejected the mps request to confine the commissioner 's role to england .
it says a uk-wide remit will ensure a consistent approach to all policies which are decided in westminster .
but mrs morgan fears that young people will not know who to turn to .
" the adult population would n't know whether to go to an am , an mp or a councillor so it 's very idealisic to think that young people in trouble would know who to go to .
" having this confusion is a very bad move and we 've got to change it . "

nearly half a century later this easter weekend , the aldermaston march is being revived , in a bid to prevent any new nuclear weapons being developed .
' why i 'm back to ban the bomb ' it was the late 1950s .
the cold war was in full swing and britain had just carried out its first h-bomb test at christmas island in the pacific .
a group of pacifists had planned to sail into the area in protest at the tests , but the idea proved impractical .
so peace activist hugh brock had suggested a four-day easter " pilgrimage " to a then unknown place in berkshire - aldermaston .
here , he had discovered a secret atomic weapons plant was being built .
it was to become the aldermaston atomic weapons research establishment - today the guardian of britain 's nuclear arsenal .
the direct action committee against nuclear war would have been happy if 50 people had turned up , says march organiser and veteran peace campaigner pat arrowsmith .
what materialised surprised everyone .
musicians kept up the marchers ' spirits by playing their instruments some 10,000 marchers turned out in trafalgar square waving banners , pushing children in prams and singing peace songs from sheets handed out by the organisers .
over the next four days , they braved rain and snow to march over 50 miles to a field in berkshire .
those who were there remember it as a very socially mixed , musical affair .
jazz musicians played their instruments while poets and workmen rubbed shoulders in the rain .
and when the marchers came to rest someone would reach for a guitar and play a folk song .
memories of hiroshima in 1958 pat allen , now 75 , was a young peace activist in his 20s .
now he is international worker for the campaign for nuclear disarmament .
he says hiroshima was the reason so many people marched to aldermaston .
" i remember the day the bomb was dropped - 6 august 1945 .
" the information that we had made it clear that this was a weapon that was vastly different from anything that we had ever seen before .
we believe there are schemes to create a new generation of nuclear weapons pat arrowsmith " the devastation from hiroshima was massive .
people were not only suffering from normal injuries they were suffering from radiation sickness .
" it was n't long before we discovered that radiation sickness does not go away .
" it was then that we realised there could never be another war . "
as the march was to last four days , organising it was a huge logistical operation , says organising secretary and veteran peace campaigner pat arrowsmith .
the marchers slept in sleeping bags in church halls and in community centres as they will do this weekend .
they were given food and drink by local volunteers as they will be this easter .
capability the event became an annual pilgrimage in the 1960s , with more marchers traversing the 50-mile route every year .
" people marched then because they were frightened of nuclear weapons .
they were also worried about the fall-out from nuclear tests , " says ms arrowsmith .
some 10,000 people joined the 1958 rally march " why we are marching to aldermaston now is because we believe there are schemes to create a new generation of nuclear weapons . "
a multi-billion pound redevelopment of the site is planned .
this includes a " capability " to design a successor to trident - britain 's nuclear deterrent - which is due for replacement in 2010 .
no decision has been taken on what that successor might be and the ministry of defence is tight-lipped about the possibilities .
but it has confirmed aldermaston aims to ensure it has in place the means to develop that successor when a decision is taken in the next parliament .
the mod insists whatever is decided will be within britain 's legal obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the treaty requires the signatories to work " in good faith " for total nuclear disarmament .
actress rebecca mordan , 27 , is marching to aldermaston this weekend because she believes the demonstration can truly have an impact on what the government decides .
original leaflets from first aldermaston march " this is n't like the demos for the iraq war - that was an unstoppable course of action .
" this is a very different situation - this is one where the power of the people can prevent this very dangerous development . "
the marchers are due to set off for aldermaston from trafalgar square at 1300 bst on good friday 9 april - they are expected to arrive at the berkshire weapons plant on easter monday .
aldermaston pictures were provided to bbc news online courtesy of bectu history project .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- should children 's tv viewing be limited ?

children under two should not be allowed to watch any television and older children should watch no more than two hours a day , according to researchers at the children 's hospital and regional medical centre in seattle .
the research suggested that each hour in front of the television increased a child 's chances of attention deficit disorder by 10 % .
the high levels of stimulation created by television viewing was expected to continue later life leading to difficulties in dealing with the slower pace of school and homework .
do you limit the amount of television watched by your children ?
do you think watching television is detrimental or beneficial for young children ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction given the chance kids will watch cartoons all day and all night jacqui , scotland to all the people here who claim they need the tv to keep their kids pacified - what did parents do before television was invented ?
watching people 's reaction to bush 's iraq adventure , i wonder if adults tv viewing should be limited as well .
christopher cormier , ottawa , canada moo , the difference is that in our day there were only a few programmes of interest to us .
outside of the limited kids tv segments we either watched decent quality adult tv or , more likely , went out to play .
nowadays there is wall-to-wall 24 hour cartoon channels and given the chance kids will watch cartoons all day and all night .
in this environment , some limits have to be set by parents .
jacqui , scotland this report is ludicrous , both my sister and i have watched more television than this report says we should have done .
yet both of us are very intelligent , go to two of the top private schools in the country , are articulate with correct grammar , and have indubitable concentration spans .
so there !
sam , nottingham , england children watching tv is not the problem .
the problem is the rubbish they have to watch .
mike , ipswich uk children should be introduced to lots of different things at this age - the joy of story-telling , art , movement , music , reading , building .
sitting in front of the tv is so passive .
there are better things to do with ones time for all ages , not just children , and kids would in my opinion benefit from learning other pastimes early on .
susan , london , uk what else is going on in children 's lives to affect their behaviour ?
lorraine , st albans , uk poor old television getting the blame again .
what else is going on in children 's lives to affect their behaviour ?
perhaps children that watch tv all day live in houses with nowhere to play , have fewer toys or have parents too busy making ends meet to sit and chat .
tv is an easy target .
lorraine , st albans , uk i never let my son watch tv until he was 5 years old .
i felt it was in his interest to stimulation provided by his mother and myself .
far to many parents use the tv has a baby sitter , and then wonder why they have problems .
clive , dartford , uk i think it 's down to the attitude of the parents .
if they just dump their children in front of the tv and let them watch any old rubbish just to keep them quiet then it can be a very bad thing .
if instead they look through the weeks listings , and plan out which programs they are going to watch with their children along with their children 's other activities then it should do no harm at all .
paul , england clearly the researchers have never tried to cook a meal or clean the house with a toddler round their legs ... get real , tv has it 's place. my kids have learned letters , colours , numbers and more from watching suitable tv .
it 's what you do with the children the rest of the time that matters .
they might also find that those with increased risk of add also had dietary or other factors in common - not just tv watching .
natasha , london , uk i think that you should be in control of what is watched and switch off the set at the end of a program .
jennie , egham , surrey .
so what they are saying is kids who get too much stimulus when they are young get bored with the pace of school .
is this not just another excuse by an education system which cant keep kids interested ?
i say let them be stimulated by television and by the real world .
martin brennan , scotland i think that children should be banned from watching all television , going to fast food restaurants , playing conkers , swimming backstroke in public baths and banned from the streets after 9pm .
and bring back national service and public flogging .
when all this " nanny state " rubbish fails to change the lives of one single person , can we go back to riding our bikes without helmets , going exploring in the woods all day without a mobile phone to call mum every 5 minutes , falling over without suing anyone and generally taking responsibility for our own actions ?
oh good !
andy balding , plymouth , uk .
as an already exhausted parent trying to combine child rearing with long hours in the office , the last thing i needed was a further guilt trip an exhausted father , scotland yes i think it should , but only in the sense that it stopping children from being outside , perhaps getting exercise .
no one would criticise a parent for letting their child watch educational programmes .
jane , berks , uk it would help if children did not have televisions in their bedrooms .
john , maidstone my daughter is 18 months old and watches cbeebies during the day which is aimed at her age range .
she has already started reading and can count beyond 20 .
she can also sing the theme tunes to all her favourites !
paul davies , swindon , uk i bet this was written by someone either with no children or with a nanny to deal with the children .
as an already exhausted parent trying to combine child rearing -lrb- 2 year old girl -rrb- with long hours in the office , the last thing i needed was a further guilt trip .
i would love to be able to spend more ' quality time ' with my kids but believe me when you can get 30 minutes respite by turning on the tv and putting on a favourite dvd you 'll do it .
an exhausted father , scotland i think a moderate amount of selective television viewing is not particularly harmful to children , and in many cases can be beneficial .
it can give then a more complete perspective on the outside world , and can give examples of good speech and grammar to many who live in an environment where this is scarce .
however , the viewing needs to be selective , since much of that which is available is poor in the extreme .
