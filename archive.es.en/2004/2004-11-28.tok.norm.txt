but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .

but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 muslim integrationists or extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs has a widespread network of mosques in germany in their attempts to contain islamic extremism , german authorities try not to paint all muslims as radicals .
but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .

" young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .

polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 muslim integrationists or extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs has a widespread network of mosques in germany in their attempts to contain islamic extremism , german authorities try not to paint all muslims as radicals .
but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .

" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

the constitutional court had accepted wednesday a last-minute appeal by darkazanli 's lawyers after a lower court in hamburg had ruled that he could be handed over to spain .
the 46-year-old german-syrian national was arrested in northern germany in mid-october and is accused of having provided the al qaeda terror network with logistical and financial support in britain , germany and spain since 1997 .
he is also alleged to have had ties to the three hamburg-based men who hijacked the planes in the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington .
he was questioned briefly in germany and released after the attacks .
but spanish magistrate baltasar garzon indicted him in september last year for his alleged connections to al qaeda , and has requested his extradition .
the constitutional court 's decision suspends the extradition for up to six months , and defense lawyer gül pinar said her client , who was arrested in october , should no longer be held in custody . more briefs 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 24.11.2004 -pipe- schröder has hotline to china radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 22-year-old blew himself up on friday by detonating a gas bottle in a field near hutthurm , a bavarian town where investigators had been testing 2,300 residents for a possible link to the explosive packages .
police had already carried out some 600 dna tests when news surfaced of the man 's death .
dna analysis revealed the young man , who was unemployed and lived on the family farm in hutturm , to be the sender of the exploding letters .
the packages targeted regional officials of both the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- as well as the polish consul in the city of munich , between april and august this year .
all were detected before they could wreak any damage , except one which slightly injured a municipal worker in the southern town of regen in august .
police warned that the suspect could have sent more letters before committing suicide , advising officials to be on their guard in coming days . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- far-right party rejects extremist alliance 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

the packages targeted regional officials of both the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- as well as the polish consul in the city of munich , between april and august this year .
all were detected before they could wreak any damage , except one which slightly injured a municipal worker in the southern town of regen in august .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .

" young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 the ugly side of the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's juan -lrb- no 4 -rrb- was one of those abused in madrid this week an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .
but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .

" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs .

as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .

it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 ukraine 's proud past and divided present großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev is considered the cradle of slavic civilization ukraine has always been a crossroads of history and the current conflict illustrates the yawning gap between the pro-moscow , russian-speaking orthodox east and the pro-european , ukrainian-speaking catholic west . passions roused by the disputed presidential election , officially given to viktor yanukovych , the prime minister and moscow 's favored candidate , despite claims of massive fraud , are as much about a cultural divide as politics . his rival , opposition leader viktor yushchenko , is pro-western - although he was born in the agricultural northeast near the border with russia - and keen to move ukraine into the european union and nato .
a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 the ugly side of the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's juan -lrb- no 4 -rrb- was one of those abused in madrid this week an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .
but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 the ugly side of the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's juan -lrb- no 4 -rrb- was one of those abused in madrid this week an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .
but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 iran allegedly builds secret facility for nuke program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is said to have ordered a secret nuclear facility iran has been constructing a secret tunnel since october to continue uranium enrichment , despite a deal two weeks ago to freeze the program , german news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday . der spiegel , citing a secret service file , said that iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei had personally ordered the facility built last month near the uranium enrichment site in isfahan that is under un observation .
the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .
-lrb- nov .
26 , 2004 -rrb- iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
on wednesday , iran warned it would seek to resume enrichment if the meeting did not go its way .

historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 muslim integrationists or extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs has a widespread network of mosques in germany in their attempts to contain islamic extremism , german authorities try not to paint all muslims as radicals .
but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .

its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .

instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views .

but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

21 runoff election that said yanukovych won by some one million votes .
pro-western opposition leader victor yushchenko claims the government helped rig the election in favor of his rival and is asking the court to either order a recount or a new vote . ukraine 's yanukovych bastions in the southeast have warned they would declare greater autonomy if their candidate fails to become president , fanning fears that the crisis could split the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych flanked by moscow mayor yury luzhkov , yanukovych -lrb- photo -rrb- met some 3,500 local officials from 17 of ukraine 's 27 regions and warned that the country was heading toward an imminent collapse , denouncing a vote in parliament saturday proclaiming the election invalid . " either we are capable of preserving the stability and peace in our state , or everything will collapse and very rapidly , " he told a meeting of ukraine 's russian-speaking regions where local officials demanded autonomy .
" i ask you not to take any radical measure .
when the first drop of blood is split , we wo n't be able to stop it , " yanukovych added . if the " coup " continues the regional leaders said they would hold a vote on " self-defense " - a euphemism for autonomy - should yushchenko come to power . " in the worst-case scenario of the political situation in the country , we will be united and decisive in defending the will of the ukrainian people , including holding a referendum on a possible change in the administrative and territorial status of ukraine , " their resolution said .
" in case the state coup continues and the illegitimate president comes to power " the eastern regional chief said they " reserved the right to take adequate measures of self-defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators attempt to keep warm while sharing a cup of coffee on the main square in kiev , where thousands gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on saturday .
meanwhile in kiev , tens of thousands of opposition protestors streamed into central independence square , which has turned into a week-long political demonstration mixed with a rocking street party in yushchenko 's support .
yushchenko told his followers that the russian-speaking southeastern regions traditionally allied with moscow had to be punished for threatening to break off . " we demand the opening of a criminal inquiry against the separatist governors , " yushchenko , wearing on opposition orange scarf to himself from the freezing cold , told the orange flag waving masses below him . amid the tension , outgoing president leonid kuchma said in televised remarks that a compromise over the crisis was needed to avoid " unforeseeable consequences " but the compromise still seemed a long way off .
" the negotiations are very difficult and it is difficult to say whether or not a compromise can be reached , " he cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers declared the disputed presidential election to be invalid on saturday .
the high court hearing on monday comes after parliament-backed opposition claims that the nov .
21 vote did not reflect the will of the voters in a non-binding vote that some said could influences the judges .
high geo-political importance at stake is the future direction of this nation of 48 million after 13 years of independence - yanukovych favors retaining traditional ties to moscow while yushchenko backs turning toward the west .
the vote has exacerbated historical tensions between ukraine 's west - nationalist , ukrainian-speaking and once part of poland with a large uniate catholic population - and its east - industrialized , russian-speaking , mostly orthodox and with strong cultural ties to its giant neighbor . ukraine 's geography - the nation stretches along most of russia 's western border and hugs much of the black sea 's northern coast - has assured intense interest in its internal affairs in foreign capitals from moscow to washington .
russian president vladimir putin has backed yanukovych , twice traveling to ukraine to meet with his candidate in well publicized photo ops prior to both rounds of the presidential election .
russian oil and gas pipelines run through ukraine , and kiev is a steady consumer of arms from moscow 's military complex . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- center -rrb- and polish president aleksander kwasniewskimet on friday in kiev .
meanwhile washington and the european union have lined up behind opposition and western observers ' claims that the election was marred by widespread fraud and have urged ukraine 's authorities to " review " the official vote results .
eu 's new members poland , hungary and slovakia border ukraine and the west sees the nation as a buffer state against an increasingly authoritarian russia .
western capitals say they are simply standing up for democracy in a neighbor . but moscow angrily accused the west of fomenting unrest to wrest ukraine from russia into its sphere of influence .
" you can no longer ignore the direct involvement of the american congress , that individual congressmen spend their days and nights in kiev , the non-governmental organizations , consultants , experts , " sergei yastrzhembsky , who holds the european brief at the kremlin , told an interviewer late saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian opposition issues ultimatum yushchenko supporters continued to block government buildings saturday after the first meeting between presidential rivals ended amid opposition threats of " action " if the dispute is not resolved within days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

21 runoff election that said yanukovych won by some one million votes .
pro-western opposition leader victor yushchenko claims the government helped rig the election in favor of his rival and is asking the court to either order a recount or a new vote . ukraine 's yanukovych bastions in the southeast have warned they would declare greater autonomy if their candidate fails to become president , fanning fears that the crisis could split the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych flanked by moscow mayor yury luzhkov , yanukovych -lrb- photo -rrb- met some 3,500 local officials from 17 of ukraine 's 27 regions and warned that the country was heading toward an imminent collapse , denouncing a vote in parliament saturday proclaiming the election invalid . " either we are capable of preserving the stability and peace in our state , or everything will collapse and very rapidly , " he told a meeting of ukraine 's russian-speaking regions where local officials demanded autonomy .
" i ask you not to take any radical measure .
when the first drop of blood is split , we wo n't be able to stop it , " yanukovych added . if the " coup " continues the regional leaders said they would hold a vote on " self-defense " - a euphemism for autonomy - should yushchenko come to power . " in the worst-case scenario of the political situation in the country , we will be united and decisive in defending the will of the ukrainian people , including holding a referendum on a possible change in the administrative and territorial status of ukraine , " their resolution said .
" in case the state coup continues and the illegitimate president comes to power " the eastern regional chief said they " reserved the right to take adequate measures of self-defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators attempt to keep warm while sharing a cup of coffee on the main square in kiev , where thousands gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on saturday .
meanwhile in kiev , tens of thousands of opposition protestors streamed into central independence square , which has turned into a week-long political demonstration mixed with a rocking street party in yushchenko 's support .
yushchenko told his followers that the russian-speaking southeastern regions traditionally allied with moscow had to be punished for threatening to break off . " we demand the opening of a criminal inquiry against the separatist governors , " yushchenko , wearing on opposition orange scarf to himself from the freezing cold , told the orange flag waving masses below him . amid the tension , outgoing president leonid kuchma said in televised remarks that a compromise over the crisis was needed to avoid " unforeseeable consequences " but the compromise still seemed a long way off .
" the negotiations are very difficult and it is difficult to say whether or not a compromise can be reached , " he cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers declared the disputed presidential election to be invalid on saturday .
the high court hearing on monday comes after parliament-backed opposition claims that the nov .
21 vote did not reflect the will of the voters in a non-binding vote that some said could influences the judges .
high geo-political importance at stake is the future direction of this nation of 48 million after 13 years of independence - yanukovych favors retaining traditional ties to moscow while yushchenko backs turning toward the west .
the vote has exacerbated historical tensions between ukraine 's west - nationalist , ukrainian-speaking and once part of poland with a large uniate catholic population - and its east - industrialized , russian-speaking , mostly orthodox and with strong cultural ties to its giant neighbor . ukraine 's geography - the nation stretches along most of russia 's western border and hugs much of the black sea 's northern coast - has assured intense interest in its internal affairs in foreign capitals from moscow to washington .
russian president vladimir putin has backed yanukovych , twice traveling to ukraine to meet with his candidate in well publicized photo ops prior to both rounds of the presidential election .
russian oil and gas pipelines run through ukraine , and kiev is a steady consumer of arms from moscow 's military complex . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- center -rrb- and polish president aleksander kwasniewskimet on friday in kiev .
meanwhile washington and the european union have lined up behind opposition and western observers ' claims that the election was marred by widespread fraud and have urged ukraine 's authorities to " review " the official vote results .
eu 's new members poland , hungary and slovakia border ukraine and the west sees the nation as a buffer state against an increasingly authoritarian russia .
western capitals say they are simply standing up for democracy in a neighbor . but moscow angrily accused the west of fomenting unrest to wrest ukraine from russia into its sphere of influence .
" you can no longer ignore the direct involvement of the american congress , that individual congressmen spend their days and nights in kiev , the non-governmental organizations , consultants , experts , " sergei yastrzhembsky , who holds the european brief at the kremlin , told an interviewer late saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian opposition issues ultimatum yushchenko supporters continued to block government buildings saturday after the first meeting between presidential rivals ended amid opposition threats of " action " if the dispute is not resolved within days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .

the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

21 runoff election that said yanukovych won by some one million votes .
pro-western opposition leader victor yushchenko claims the government helped rig the election in favor of his rival and is asking the court to either order a recount or a new vote . ukraine 's yanukovych bastions in the southeast have warned they would declare greater autonomy if their candidate fails to become president , fanning fears that the crisis could split the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych flanked by moscow mayor yury luzhkov , yanukovych -lrb- photo -rrb- met some 3,500 local officials from 17 of ukraine 's 27 regions and warned that the country was heading toward an imminent collapse , denouncing a vote in parliament saturday proclaiming the election invalid . " either we are capable of preserving the stability and peace in our state , or everything will collapse and very rapidly , " he told a meeting of ukraine 's russian-speaking regions where local officials demanded autonomy .
" i ask you not to take any radical measure .
when the first drop of blood is split , we wo n't be able to stop it , " yanukovych added . if the " coup " continues the regional leaders said they would hold a vote on " self-defense " - a euphemism for autonomy - should yushchenko come to power . " in the worst-case scenario of the political situation in the country , we will be united and decisive in defending the will of the ukrainian people , including holding a referendum on a possible change in the administrative and territorial status of ukraine , " their resolution said .
" in case the state coup continues and the illegitimate president comes to power " the eastern regional chief said they " reserved the right to take adequate measures of self-defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators attempt to keep warm while sharing a cup of coffee on the main square in kiev , where thousands gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on saturday .
meanwhile in kiev , tens of thousands of opposition protestors streamed into central independence square , which has turned into a week-long political demonstration mixed with a rocking street party in yushchenko 's support .
yushchenko told his followers that the russian-speaking southeastern regions traditionally allied with moscow had to be punished for threatening to break off . " we demand the opening of a criminal inquiry against the separatist governors , " yushchenko , wearing on opposition orange scarf to himself from the freezing cold , told the orange flag waving masses below him . amid the tension , outgoing president leonid kuchma said in televised remarks that a compromise over the crisis was needed to avoid " unforeseeable consequences " but the compromise still seemed a long way off .
" the negotiations are very difficult and it is difficult to say whether or not a compromise can be reached , " he cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers declared the disputed presidential election to be invalid on saturday .
the high court hearing on monday comes after parliament-backed opposition claims that the nov .
21 vote did not reflect the will of the voters in a non-binding vote that some said could influences the judges .
high geo-political importance at stake is the future direction of this nation of 48 million after 13 years of independence - yanukovych favors retaining traditional ties to moscow while yushchenko backs turning toward the west .
the vote has exacerbated historical tensions between ukraine 's west - nationalist , ukrainian-speaking and once part of poland with a large uniate catholic population - and its east - industrialized , russian-speaking , mostly orthodox and with strong cultural ties to its giant neighbor . ukraine 's geography - the nation stretches along most of russia 's western border and hugs much of the black sea 's northern coast - has assured intense interest in its internal affairs in foreign capitals from moscow to washington .
russian president vladimir putin has backed yanukovych , twice traveling to ukraine to meet with his candidate in well publicized photo ops prior to both rounds of the presidential election .
russian oil and gas pipelines run through ukraine , and kiev is a steady consumer of arms from moscow 's military complex . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- center -rrb- and polish president aleksander kwasniewskimet on friday in kiev .
meanwhile washington and the european union have lined up behind opposition and western observers ' claims that the election was marred by widespread fraud and have urged ukraine 's authorities to " review " the official vote results .
eu 's new members poland , hungary and slovakia border ukraine and the west sees the nation as a buffer state against an increasingly authoritarian russia .
western capitals say they are simply standing up for democracy in a neighbor . but moscow angrily accused the west of fomenting unrest to wrest ukraine from russia into its sphere of influence .
" you can no longer ignore the direct involvement of the american congress , that individual congressmen spend their days and nights in kiev , the non-governmental organizations , consultants , experts , " sergei yastrzhembsky , who holds the european brief at the kremlin , told an interviewer late saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian opposition issues ultimatum yushchenko supporters continued to block government buildings saturday after the first meeting between presidential rivals ended amid opposition threats of " action " if the dispute is not resolved within days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 the ugly side of the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's juan -lrb- no 4 -rrb- was one of those abused in madrid this week an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .
but has it really ever been away ? normally , soccer fans the world over avidly follow the european leagues and international scene for the quality and excitement of the game .
but recently , the eyes of the global fan base have been attracted to the unsavory aspects of the game - namely the racial abuse of players . the recent increase in reported offences has once again turned the spotlight on the uglier side of the beautiful game and raised the question : are these latest sickening outbursts just copycat incidents or is european soccer still rife with racists and xenophobes ? for the lay person , soccer ’ s most recent racist outbursts can be mapped out in headlines .
it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .
during a training session ahead of spain ’ s world cup qualifying game against belgium , aragones told reyes he was a better player than his club colleague thierry henry before referring to the frenchman as a “ black shit . ” england-spain match raises profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the england national soccer team .
the racist shadow continued to creep across the game , documented in the pages of the press , until it loomed even larger during spain ’ s friendly match with england in madrid .
a number of black players in the england team soon found themselves to be the next target of monkey chants , offensive hand gestures and nazi salutes from spanish supporters in the santiago bernabeu stadium . the scenes drew wide-spread condemnation from many quarters and led to the establishment of a fifa investigation which is still in progress . the specter of racism then reared its ugly head in the english premiership last sunday when birmingham city striker dwight yorke was abused by a blackburn rovers supporter as he warmed up on the sidelines with his fellow substitutes during the match . bernabeu hate mob strike again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans in madrid were once again in the spotlight after racist abuse was directed at leverkusen players on tuesday night .
spanish fans were again involved when , two days later , real madrid 's champions league match against bayer leverkusen was marred by racist chanting with bayer 's brazilian defenders roque junior and juan the target of abuse from real 's ultra sur hooligan element during the 1-1 draw .
the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .
the fact that there has been little widespread reporting in recent times has given the impression the problem had been dealt with , ” mann said .
“ the high profile incidents at the spain-england match showed that it hasn ’ t . ” “ there has been a general lethargy across europe in dealing with racism in soccer , " he added .
" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .
this will help turn the spotlight on the problem and help groups and campaigns fighting racism in germany and the rest of europe . ” nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 israelis eager to get polish passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has become a new land of possibility for many israelis a large number of israelis have roots in poland , having either emigrated during the communist era or been forced out by anti-jewish purges .
now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .

and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2004 iran allegedly builds secret facility for nuke program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is said to have ordered a secret nuclear facility iran has been constructing a secret tunnel since october to continue uranium enrichment , despite a deal two weeks ago to freeze the program , german news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday . der spiegel , citing a secret service file , said that iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei had personally ordered the facility built last month near the uranium enrichment site in isfahan that is under un observation .
the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .
the clandestine project is being led by a task force that answers directly to khamenei , the report said . but in tehran , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said the report was " baseless " and that it was ridiculous to suggest iran would even try to hide such a facility .
" the ministry of roads and transportation builds lots of tunnels in iran .
but this news is baseless .
in the world today , with all the radars and spy satellites which see everything , how can we hide a tunnel ? " he said . iran insists it has declared all of its nuclear facilities to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , which has been probing the country for two years .
and despite talks having broken off ahead of an iaea meeting monday , tehran remains confident that it is close to a deal with the eu over a freeze of uranium enrichment activities . " there is no deadlock .
we are on the way forward and the corrections the europeans have made in the text of the resolution -lrb- for the un meeting -rrb- are positive , " said the iranian spokesman in vienna , hossein moussavian , according to afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a uranium conversion facility in isfahan , central iran the iran-eu talks broke off saturday , opening the door to moves towards un sanctions .
a diplomat close to the talks said britain , france and germany had given iran until late sunday to agree to a full freeze , including 20 disputed centrifuges , or they would table a tough resolution at the iaea meeting . " not the end of the world " moussavian 's comments were in contrast to more confrontational statements being made in tehran ; iran on sunday stuck by its demand that the 20 centrifuges be exempted from its suspension pledge and shrugged off the danger of being referred to the un security council as " not the end of the world . " the united states wants the iaea to bring iran before the security council , which could impose punishing economic sanctions , for what washington says is a secret nuclear weapons program .
but eu negotiators britain , france and germany have for over a year been stressing a policy of " constructive engagement " to get iran to cooperate with the iaea and have proposed an accommodating resolution to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors , in a meeting that began thursday and was on friday adjourned until monday . diplomats said iran was sending mixed signals as hardliners in tehran are resisting cutting a nuclear deal .
the hardliners " do n't trust the process of negotiation .
they say that europe is asking too much and not giving iran anything , " a diplomat close to the talks said . the eu has promised increased trade , which would include helping iran get into the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and a host of other incentives , but these are to come in a long-term agreement to be worked out after the suspension is in effect . iran wants r & d exemption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman ingrid holl from canada at the start of the 35-nation board of governors meeting of the iaea on friday .
but another problem , which could torpedo the talks , is that iran is insisting on its right to continue nuclear research .
iran had agreed with the european trio before the iaea meeting on the enrichment freeze .
but it now says it wants to continue " research and development " with the 20 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium to make nuclear fuel but also what can be the raw material for atomic weapons . " the question of research and development has nothing to do with a suspension , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said . the crisis is now at a crucial point since the european trio , who insist on an unconditional suspension of all enrichment activities , are losing patience with iran , and threatening to join the hardline us side , diplomats said . " we have no progress .
it is up to the iranians now to ponder what they will do , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp saturday after iran-eu negotiations broke off and a sunday deadline for iran to signal compliance was set .
" they have a very serious decision to make , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

the tunnel , which the magazine said is out of the view of spy satellites , is intended to house a production site for large amounts of uranium uf6 gas which can be enriched in gas centrifuges - a key step in the building of a nuclear bomb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2004 muslim integrationists or extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs has a widespread network of mosques in germany in their attempts to contain islamic extremism , german authorities try not to paint all muslims as radicals .
but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

" the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .

21 runoff election that said yanukovych won by some one million votes .
pro-western opposition leader victor yushchenko claims the government helped rig the election in favor of his rival and is asking the court to either order a recount or a new vote . ukraine 's yanukovych bastions in the southeast have warned they would declare greater autonomy if their candidate fails to become president , fanning fears that the crisis could split the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych flanked by moscow mayor yury luzhkov , yanukovych -lrb- photo -rrb- met some 3,500 local officials from 17 of ukraine 's 27 regions and warned that the country was heading toward an imminent collapse , denouncing a vote in parliament saturday proclaiming the election invalid . " either we are capable of preserving the stability and peace in our state , or everything will collapse and very rapidly , " he told a meeting of ukraine 's russian-speaking regions where local officials demanded autonomy .
" i ask you not to take any radical measure .
when the first drop of blood is split , we wo n't be able to stop it , " yanukovych added . if the " coup " continues the regional leaders said they would hold a vote on " self-defense " - a euphemism for autonomy - should yushchenko come to power . " in the worst-case scenario of the political situation in the country , we will be united and decisive in defending the will of the ukrainian people , including holding a referendum on a possible change in the administrative and territorial status of ukraine , " their resolution said .
" in case the state coup continues and the illegitimate president comes to power " the eastern regional chief said they " reserved the right to take adequate measures of self-defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators attempt to keep warm while sharing a cup of coffee on the main square in kiev , where thousands gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on saturday .
meanwhile in kiev , tens of thousands of opposition protestors streamed into central independence square , which has turned into a week-long political demonstration mixed with a rocking street party in yushchenko 's support .
yushchenko told his followers that the russian-speaking southeastern regions traditionally allied with moscow had to be punished for threatening to break off . " we demand the opening of a criminal inquiry against the separatist governors , " yushchenko , wearing on opposition orange scarf to himself from the freezing cold , told the orange flag waving masses below him . amid the tension , outgoing president leonid kuchma said in televised remarks that a compromise over the crisis was needed to avoid " unforeseeable consequences " but the compromise still seemed a long way off .
" the negotiations are very difficult and it is difficult to say whether or not a compromise can be reached , " he cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers declared the disputed presidential election to be invalid on saturday .
the high court hearing on monday comes after parliament-backed opposition claims that the nov .
21 vote did not reflect the will of the voters in a non-binding vote that some said could influences the judges .
high geo-political importance at stake is the future direction of this nation of 48 million after 13 years of independence - yanukovych favors retaining traditional ties to moscow while yushchenko backs turning toward the west .
the vote has exacerbated historical tensions between ukraine 's west - nationalist , ukrainian-speaking and once part of poland with a large uniate catholic population - and its east - industrialized , russian-speaking , mostly orthodox and with strong cultural ties to its giant neighbor . ukraine 's geography - the nation stretches along most of russia 's western border and hugs much of the black sea 's northern coast - has assured intense interest in its internal affairs in foreign capitals from moscow to washington .
russian president vladimir putin has backed yanukovych , twice traveling to ukraine to meet with his candidate in well publicized photo ops prior to both rounds of the presidential election .

eu 's new members poland , hungary and slovakia border ukraine and the west sees the nation as a buffer state against an increasingly authoritarian russia .

delegates to a republican congress in the southern state of bavaria overwhelmingly backed a motion by the party 's leadership to reject a proposed electoral alliance with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the far-right german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , saying they were too radical .
the motion rejected cooperation " categorically with such parties that want to eliminate our state or the free and democratic constitutional order . "
the delegates singled out the most extremist of the three , the npd , which party leader rolf schlierer said had " an understanding of politics diametrically opposed to that of the republicans . "
he accused the npd of hoping to rip apart his party from within with its offer to join the alliance with the dvu .
the leaders of the npd and the dvu voted to join forces at a convention last month , putting aside decades of rivalry to enter joint lists of candidates for the 2006 national elections and the european elections three years later . more briefs 28.11.2004 -pipe- al qaeda suspect seeks release 26.11.2004 -pipe- germany charges us woman with treason 26.11.2004 -pipe- einstein text nets € 100,000 26.11.2004 -pipe- iraqi premier to visit germany 26.11.2004 -pipe- eurofighter partners order second tranche 25.11.2004 -pipe- german prince was drunk during attacks 25.11.2004 -pipe- germany 's tv talk queen wins case 25.11.2004 -pipe- ex-chancellor 's guest worker remarks spark outrage 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .

it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .

yushchenko told his followers that the russian-speaking southeastern regions traditionally allied with moscow had to be punished for threatening to break off . " we demand the opening of a criminal inquiry against the separatist governors , " yushchenko , wearing on opposition orange scarf to himself from the freezing cold , told the orange flag waving masses below him . amid the tension , outgoing president leonid kuchma said in televised remarks that a compromise over the crisis was needed to avoid " unforeseeable consequences " but the compromise still seemed a long way off .
" the negotiations are very difficult and it is difficult to say whether or not a compromise can be reached , " he cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers declared the disputed presidential election to be invalid on saturday .
the high court hearing on monday comes after parliament-backed opposition claims that the nov .
21 vote did not reflect the will of the voters in a non-binding vote that some said could influences the judges .
high geo-political importance at stake is the future direction of this nation of 48 million after 13 years of independence - yanukovych favors retaining traditional ties to moscow while yushchenko backs turning toward the west .
the vote has exacerbated historical tensions between ukraine 's west - nationalist , ukrainian-speaking and once part of poland with a large uniate catholic population - and its east - industrialized , russian-speaking , mostly orthodox and with strong cultural ties to its giant neighbor . ukraine 's geography - the nation stretches along most of russia 's western border and hugs much of the black sea 's northern coast - has assured intense interest in its internal affairs in foreign capitals from moscow to washington .
russian president vladimir putin has backed yanukovych , twice traveling to ukraine to meet with his candidate in well publicized photo ops prior to both rounds of the presidential election .
russian oil and gas pipelines run through ukraine , and kiev is a steady consumer of arms from moscow 's military complex . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- center -rrb- and polish president aleksander kwasniewskimet on friday in kiev .
meanwhile washington and the european union have lined up behind opposition and western observers ' claims that the election was marred by widespread fraud and have urged ukraine 's authorities to " review " the official vote results .
eu 's new members poland , hungary and slovakia border ukraine and the west sees the nation as a buffer state against an increasingly authoritarian russia .
western capitals say they are simply standing up for democracy in a neighbor . but moscow angrily accused the west of fomenting unrest to wrest ukraine from russia into its sphere of influence .
" you can no longer ignore the direct involvement of the american congress , that individual congressmen spend their days and nights in kiev , the non-governmental organizations , consultants , experts , " sergei yastrzhembsky , who holds the european brief at the kremlin , told an interviewer late saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian opposition issues ultimatum yushchenko supporters continued to block government buildings saturday after the first meeting between presidential rivals ended amid opposition threats of " action " if the dispute is not resolved within days .

now many are reapplying for polish passports , largely for pragmatic reasons . every monday morning , a normally quiet side street in a residential area of tel aviv bustles with activity .
israelis , young and old , line up in front of the polish embassy there , digging deep into their pasts in an attempt to prove to authorities that they are entitled to a polish passport . it is an ironic reversal , since many of these same people , or their parents , once lined up in poland knocking on the doors of foreign embassies trying to get a visa to would enable to escape anti-semitic persecution or simply make their way toward a better life . today , that better life might be back in poland . " i would like to have a polish passport as insurance for my future , " said michael kerner , 43 , an israeli with two children .
his father and mother were born in and grew up in poland , leaving in 1957 when anti-jewish sentiment made life there too difficult for them .
although he has polish roots , kerner considers himself an israeli , since he was born in israel , speaks hebrew and is married to an israeli woman . " nevertheless , israel is not the most stable place , " he said .
" i want to have a place to go to which will be easier . " options for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream of a jewish homeland is still strong is israel , but the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians has led some to question whether that dream is an impossible one .
suicide attacks , the palestinian intifada , and a nation in an almost continual state of siege have many looking for other options for themselves and their children . poland , once the country they and their families turned the backs on , is beginning to look more attractive , particularly after it joined the eu on may 1 .
while many countries , including germany , still have restrictions in place that prevent new eu citizens from coming to work there for years , britain and ireland have already opened their borders . " young people know that poland is now in europe and they want to be free to travel , not to be pressed to show the israeli passport which always can be attacked because of the conflict , " said miriam akavia , a novelist who arrived in israel from poland in the late 1940s . back to the roots but besides having more freedom to travel or looking for a possible new home should the israel-palestinian conflict spin out of control , others seeking polish passports do so to get closer to their jewish roots .
for thousands of polish jews now living in israel , the question of identity is a complex one .
until the 1970s , leading politicians in the israeli parliament used to argue in polish . for some , like arts manager yosi notkowitz , his new polish passport is an acknowledgement of the fact that his feet are really in both countries .
he remembers the stories his parents told him about life in poland - his family history , the holocaust and polish art , music and literature . " i want to be a part of it , " he said .
" i 'm like a bridge from the past to the future . " challenge for embassy for the polish embassy in tel aviv , the wave of applicants is proving a challenge , since the staff is ill equipped to cope with the added workload . " we can accept about 100 applications a month , approximately half of the applicants get a positive answer from poland , " he said . the situation is made all the more complicated since local administration officials in poland often drag their feet when processing individual claims .
polish law is not clear regarding the status of property left behind by individual jews , and up to now , warsaw has only agreed to return the property of jewish organizations , not individuals . business opportunity the rush for passports helped some start up lucrative business sidelines processing applications and helping with translations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret rok used to work in the tourist industry , but a flare-up of conflict in the region kept travellers away and drove her to look for a new business opportunity .
since she speaks polish , she was hired by a law firm to help israelis fill out documents required by polish authorities or provide information about setting up a business in poland . " we have more and more israeli people coming to us and we 're opening a new service especially for them , " she said . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

a reformist , he speaks ukrainian and is married to an american , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko -lrb- right -rrb- and his opponent , pro-moscow prime minister viktor yanukovych yanukovych is from the coal-mining community of donetsk , a russian-speaking area that accounts for 10 percent of ukraine 's population and some 20 percent of its gross domestic product .
he wants to make russian an official language and was openly supported by moscow during the election campaign . " these differences have been exploited by the authorities to stay in power , " said andrew wilson , a ukraine specialist at the london-based royal institute of international affairs .
" they made the contestable decision to emphasize the russian language , the relationship with russia , they caricatured yushchenko as an american puppet , called him bushenko . " " little russia " the capital kiev , with its liberal lifestyle , lies somewhere in the middle of the conflict , an ancient city embracing both cultures , founded in 482 , once the heart of an empire and considered the cradle of slavic civilization . indeed , ukraine can lay claim to a varied history dating back thousands of years and mirroring the progress of human civilization .
it can point to the world 's oldest house , a 15,000-year old shelter made of mammoth bones , the world 's oldest known map , 12,000 years old and etched on a mammoth tooth , and the world 's oldest known recognizable oven , at 20,000 years old .
historians believe man first rode on horseback some 6,000 years ago on the ukrainian steppes and around the same time wore the first pair of trousers , a garment ideally suited to riding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold-crusted domes of the 11th century monastery of caves in kiev the glorious golden-domed churches and monasteries of kiev were the work of king vladimir and his son yaroslav in the 10th and 11th centuries , while the broad main avenue in kiev , kreshchatik , -lrb- literally " christening street " -rrb- , is a reminder of where their subjects made for the river to be baptized . ukraine , known affectionately as " little russia , " was part of the russian empire from 1654 until its collapse in 1917 after the bolshevik revolution .
it quickly declared independence , but was occupied by bolshevik troops in 1918 until a treaty in 1921 assigned western ukraine to poland , czechoslovakia and romania , while the eastern and central territories formed the ukrainian soviet socialist republic . famine under stalin the stalin years saw some of the darkest chapters in ukrainian history .
with its wide , rolling plains it was the ideal bread basket , but stalin 's forced collectivization and a huge increase in demand for wheat led to a grain shortage and an " artificial famine , " still considered by ukrainians as an act of genocide , which saw between seven and 10 million people perish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef stalin ukraine suffered again in world war ii , trapped between moscow and berlin .
officially six million died , but recent research has put the figure nearer 10 million , whether in combat , due to the privations of war , massacred by nazis and soviets alike , or in concentration camps .
the most notorious killing ground was babiy yar , kiev , where in september 1941 , german forces executed nearly 34,000 jews .
around 150,000 ukrainians and others were later believed to have been killed there .
in 1940 , the population of kiev was 900,000 ; in 1945 it was barely 186,000 . at the end of the war the soviets united the western and eastern sides and crimea , formerly part of the russian federation , was added in 1954 . independence , a first by 1991 , growing opposition to moscow led ukraine to declare independence . ukraine has struggled during the post-soviet years , as the economy shrank , inflation rocketed and corruption riddled government , but investment has begun to pick up and the economy grew by more than 12 percent during the first nine months of 2004 . alex vatanka , editor of jane 's sentinel security assessment , said eastern ukraine and russia were still in many ways interdependent through their heavy industry .
" russians and ukrainians in the eastern side really need to work together economically , and by extension politically , " he told afp . but as russia became increasingly authoritarian , he went on , people in the west " want to get away from that and come closer to the european union .

it began in the first week in october when the spanish national coach luis aragones employed what he called a motivational technique on arsenal ’ s spanish forward jose antonio reyes .

the spanish giants are now the subject of an investigation by uefa . and then on thursday evening , racist taunting aimed at partizan belgrade 's black players overshadowed the serbian side 's 2-2 draw against lazio in rome to plunge the game in europe into another race shame .
lazio ’ s hardcore ultras , notorious for their xenophobic and racist views and their support for the former right wing regime in yugoslavia , targeted cameroon striker pierre boya in particular during the explosive uefa cup group e clash . many might think that this spate of reports detailing racist abuse at soccer games constitutes a sudden outburst , a series of knock-on effects stemming from a publicized scandal .
but leon mann , the spokesperson for the british organization kick it out , told dw-world that the reality is more depressing than that . the specter of racism remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ this has been going on for a number of years , week in , week out .

" many associations don ’ t even regard it as a problem .
they first have to admit that they have a problem before they can do something about it .
there are campaigns in most european countries but the majority of them go unheard . " publicity brings racism to the fore however , mann went on to say that while there are very obvious negative aspects from these recent incidents , there are also very positive ones too . " this publicity has woken people up , " he said .
" we had calls from people after the spain match who were shocked and appalled by what they heard and saw .
and in terms of doing something about it , the high profile incidents have given the likes of fifa and uefa the evidence they need to take action .
it is , after all , a legal matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , where far-right groups have infiltrated supporters and have consistently abused players with little or no action being taken , racism remains a problem and despite being quashed to a certain extent by policing and club measures in the top leagues , it is still rife in the lower divisions .
however , the recent publicity is likely to have a similar positive effect on anti-racism groups in germany . europe-wide awareness helped by press “ during the real madrid-leverkusen game this week , there was nothing said about the racist chants and far-right flags during the tv coverage , ” martin endemann , of the german organization flutlicht , told dw-world .
“ when racism happens , it is only really reported when english teams are involved because the european press follow events surrounding england , for some reason . ” “ but after the leverkusen game , there has been more reports on racism in soccer in the german press than ever before .

but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many . there are some muslim groups in germany that leave little doubt as to their political leanings .
" caliphate state , " the now-defunct organization led by metin kaplan , had as its goal the overturning of the secular turkish state and an establishment of an islamic theocracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was extradited to turkey in october 2004 , had already served four years in prison for calling for the murder of a political opponent .
the german office for the protection of the constitution had banned his group in 2001 for its anti-democratic , unconstitutional activities . but kaplan 's group was but one small political-religious sect with fewer than 1,000 members .
its influence on the millions of muslims in germany was small .
however , there is another group that some feel poses a larger challenge to german society , the turkish-dominated " islamic community of milli görüs . " with over 26,000 members , milli görüs is the largest islamic organization in germany , with a tightly woven network of mosques and clubs for women and youth , which carry a good deal of influence , particularly in predominately turkish sections of german cities and towns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milli görüs describes itself as an apolitical , unaffiliated lobby for the interests of muslims living in germany .
but officials at the german office for the protection of the constitution on both the federal and state levels are convinced that milli görüs really acts as the foreign office of the islamist leader and former turkish premier necmettin erbakan , and that the group secretly seeks to dismantle germany 's democratic structures . proving this has proven to be difficult .
as opposed to its actions during the first decades following its founding in the 1970s , since the middle of the 1990s , milli görüs has strived to present itself to the public as a democratic organization in favor of the integration of muslims into german society .
the group has never had a history of violence . only lip service ? milli görüs ' general secretary , oguz ücüncü , considers the description of his organization by constitutional watchdogs as a " wolf in sheep 's clothing " as unfair and inaccurate . " that 's the basic question that the constitutional protection authorities pose , whether what we say can be believed , " he told deutsche welle .
" we believe that people can take us by our word .
our recognition of german democratic structures is not just lip service , but a part of our socialization here in germany - already in its fourth generation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on its internet site , milli görüs presents itself as a model for dialog between muslims and non-muslims in germany .
it praises not only the german constitution , but also condemns terrorist attacks of fundamentalist groups , calls on its members to take out german citizenship and engage actively in german society .
milli görüs even advocates the acceptance of equal rights for women within islam . debate needed but security authorities , like the head of berlin 's office for the protection of the constitution , claudia schmid , warn against blindly accepting such avowals at face value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special police carry evidence out of a islamic center in the town of muenster that was searched in 2003 .
" politically organized islam has very subtle means which should not be underestimated and which aim to advance the political aims of an organization and reach into people 's everyday lives , " she said .
" separating between openness towards foreign cultures on the one hand and naïve credulity on the other is very difficult .
it requires experience and debate . " schmid and others argue that the internal structure of milli görüs is anything but democratic .
instead , it is based on the principles of command and obey , according to them .
and although it happens more rarely today , there are still statements made by individual milli görüs officials that are based on anti-democratic and anti-semitic views . " the problematic thing is that there are subgroups and individuals within milli görüs who foster anti-semitic world views , " kai hafez , an islam expert , told deutsche welle in an interview two years ago " we know that there are these tendencies within the group . " hafez added the question is whether one attempts to prosecute individual actors or whether one seeks to enact a ban against the entire organization . however , many agree that a ban on milli görüs as a whole would be unrealistic and counterproductive - not only because such a ban would be difficult to put into place , since no criminal activity by the group has been proven , but also due to the fact that many muslims pray in mosques run by milli görüs , who would likely see a ban as repression against islam . reform from the inside ? moreover , constitutional watchdogs say it is possible that the public statements by milli görüs - its willingness to engage in dialog and its acceptance of democratic structures - could be more than simple duplicity : they could have developed their own positive dynamic . in parts of the organization , a transformational process could be underway .
the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of north rhine-westphalia wrote in a recent report that there are some progressive and liberally oriented leaders in milli görüs .
but up to now , they have n't been able to successfully compete with the islamists still present in the group . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german intelligence says islamists present major threat germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security .
