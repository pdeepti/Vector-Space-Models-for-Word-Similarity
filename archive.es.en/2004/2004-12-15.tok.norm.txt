they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2004 opportunity or risk for deutsche börse ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse 's werner seifert again tries to take over the lse germany 's largest stock exchange , the deutsche börse in frankfurt , is attempting to take over the london stock exchange .
many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 europe leads way in climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to set new global emission goals for 2012 at the climate change conference in buenos aires , the eu has focused attention on the post-kyoto process .
now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .

" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu .

" if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone .

" the expulsions , rapes and murders that have taken place can not now be undone , " köhler told au envoys in the ethiopian capital addis ababa . the united nations and human rights groups have accused warring sides of massive human rights violations in darfur , a resource-rich region the size of france .
the conflict flared up in february 2003 , when rebels drawn from the black african population rose up against khartoum , complaining that their region has been marginalized . the uprising prompted a heavy-handed response from khartoum and its allied militia , leading to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives , displaced at least 1.6 million and spawned what the united nations has termed the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today .
in october , the au said it would boost the number of personnel monitoring a shaky truce signed in april from 465 to 3,320 , but it has yet to get enough men on the ground . still possibility for action köhler , who held talks earlier with au commission chairman alpha omar konare , urged the international community to assist the pan-african body in resolving the deadly darfur conflict . " i do n't think that the international community is helpless , " he said .
" the most important thing now is to listen very closely to what the au proposes about ways of settling the conflict , and it is on this basis that the international community should come together to finally resolve that conflict .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .

looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .
finding the balance between the two continues to be a matter of debate . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 europe leads way in climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to set new global emission goals for 2012 at the climate change conference in buenos aires , the eu has focused attention on the post-kyoto process .
now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 combatting stereotypes with facts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking ahead to a good education though stereotypes about foreigners continue to proliferate in germany , a new study is challenging some beliefs about immigrant girls .
they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .
finding the balance between the two continues to be a matter of debate . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone . jokes about turkey are enjoying something of a boom in brussels right now , both among journalists and even among some politicians .
while during the numerous meetings of ambassadors , councils and the european commission , turkey 's accession is discussed in all seriousness , during breaks and behind-the-scenes conversations , everyone is eager to relate a best or worst story that took place while once on vacation in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional market stall in istanbul after that , it 's not unusual that stories extolling beautiful beaches turn into comparisons between recep tayyip erdogan and his government with carpet sellers , bazaar traders and vegetable sellers .
fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu .

" if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .

but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important .

" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 what brussels really thinks about turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images like this one worry many in brussels , but they keep it quiet in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone . jokes about turkey are enjoying something of a boom in brussels right now , both among journalists and even among some politicians .
while during the numerous meetings of ambassadors , councils and the european commission , turkey 's accession is discussed in all seriousness , during breaks and behind-the-scenes conversations , everyone is eager to relate a best or worst story that took place while once on vacation in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional market stall in istanbul after that , it 's not unusual that stories extolling beautiful beaches turn into comparisons between recep tayyip erdogan and his government with carpet sellers , bazaar traders and vegetable sellers .
fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2004 opportunity or risk for deutsche börse ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse 's werner seifert again tries to take over the lse germany 's largest stock exchange , the deutsche börse in frankfurt , is attempting to take over the london stock exchange .
many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .

after pushing for accession for so long , the eu summit could be the beginning of the end of the long wait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 europe leads way in climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to set new global emission goals for 2012 at the climate change conference in buenos aires , the eu has focused attention on the post-kyoto process .
now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 combatting stereotypes with facts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking ahead to a good education though stereotypes about foreigners continue to proliferate in germany , a new study is challenging some beliefs about immigrant girls .
they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .
finding the balance between the two continues to be a matter of debate . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

" the expulsions , rapes and murders that have taken place can not now be undone , " köhler told au envoys in the ethiopian capital addis ababa . the united nations and human rights groups have accused warring sides of massive human rights violations in darfur , a resource-rich region the size of france .
the conflict flared up in february 2003 , when rebels drawn from the black african population rose up against khartoum , complaining that their region has been marginalized . the uprising prompted a heavy-handed response from khartoum and its allied militia , leading to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives , displaced at least 1.6 million and spawned what the united nations has termed the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today .
in october , the au said it would boost the number of personnel monitoring a shaky truce signed in april from 465 to 3,320 , but it has yet to get enough men on the ground . still possibility for action köhler , who held talks earlier with au commission chairman alpha omar konare , urged the international community to assist the pan-african body in resolving the deadly darfur conflict . " i do n't think that the international community is helpless , " he said .
" the most important thing now is to listen very closely to what the au proposes about ways of settling the conflict , and it is on this basis that the international community should come together to finally resolve that conflict . " au mediators are currently trying to broker a lasting peace between the khartoum government and darfur rebels in the nigerian capital city of abuja . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to send troops to sudan germany will send troops to sudan to support african union peacekeeping efforts in the war-torn region of darfur .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 what brussels really thinks about turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images like this one worry many in brussels , but they keep it quiet in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone . jokes about turkey are enjoying something of a boom in brussels right now , both among journalists and even among some politicians .
while during the numerous meetings of ambassadors , councils and the european commission , turkey 's accession is discussed in all seriousness , during breaks and behind-the-scenes conversations , everyone is eager to relate a best or worst story that took place while once on vacation in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional market stall in istanbul after that , it 's not unusual that stories extolling beautiful beaches turn into comparisons between recep tayyip erdogan and his government with carpet sellers , bazaar traders and vegetable sellers .
fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it . " bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , france want turkey in eu germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 europe leads way in climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to set new global emission goals for 2012 at the climate change conference in buenos aires , the eu has focused attention on the post-kyoto process .
now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .

in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .

catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 what brussels really thinks about turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images like this one worry many in brussels , but they keep it quiet in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone . jokes about turkey are enjoying something of a boom in brussels right now , both among journalists and even among some politicians .
while during the numerous meetings of ambassadors , councils and the european commission , turkey 's accession is discussed in all seriousness , during breaks and behind-the-scenes conversations , everyone is eager to relate a best or worst story that took place while once on vacation in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional market stall in istanbul after that , it 's not unusual that stories extolling beautiful beaches turn into comparisons between recep tayyip erdogan and his government with carpet sellers , bazaar traders and vegetable sellers .
fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it . " bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , france want turkey in eu germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .

that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it .

" the expulsions , rapes and murders that have taken place can not now be undone , " köhler told au envoys in the ethiopian capital addis ababa . the united nations and human rights groups have accused warring sides of massive human rights violations in darfur , a resource-rich region the size of france .
the conflict flared up in february 2003 , when rebels drawn from the black african population rose up against khartoum , complaining that their region has been marginalized . the uprising prompted a heavy-handed response from khartoum and its allied militia , leading to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives , displaced at least 1.6 million and spawned what the united nations has termed the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today .
in october , the au said it would boost the number of personnel monitoring a shaky truce signed in april from 465 to 3,320 , but it has yet to get enough men on the ground . still possibility for action köhler , who held talks earlier with au commission chairman alpha omar konare , urged the international community to assist the pan-african body in resolving the deadly darfur conflict . " i do n't think that the international community is helpless , " he said .
" the most important thing now is to listen very closely to what the au proposes about ways of settling the conflict , and it is on this basis that the international community should come together to finally resolve that conflict . " au mediators are currently trying to broker a lasting peace between the khartoum government and darfur rebels in the nigerian capital city of abuja . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to send troops to sudan germany will send troops to sudan to support african union peacekeeping efforts in the war-torn region of darfur .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .

more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone .

" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu .

bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

" the expulsions , rapes and murders that have taken place can not now be undone , " köhler told au envoys in the ethiopian capital addis ababa . the united nations and human rights groups have accused warring sides of massive human rights violations in darfur , a resource-rich region the size of france .
the conflict flared up in february 2003 , when rebels drawn from the black african population rose up against khartoum , complaining that their region has been marginalized . the uprising prompted a heavy-handed response from khartoum and its allied militia , leading to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives , displaced at least 1.6 million and spawned what the united nations has termed the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today .
in october , the au said it would boost the number of personnel monitoring a shaky truce signed in april from 465 to 3,320 , but it has yet to get enough men on the ground . still possibility for action köhler , who held talks earlier with au commission chairman alpha omar konare , urged the international community to assist the pan-african body in resolving the deadly darfur conflict . " i do n't think that the international community is helpless , " he said .
" the most important thing now is to listen very closely to what the au proposes about ways of settling the conflict , and it is on this basis that the international community should come together to finally resolve that conflict . " au mediators are currently trying to broker a lasting peace between the khartoum government and darfur rebels in the nigerian capital city of abuja . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to send troops to sudan germany will send troops to sudan to support african union peacekeeping efforts in the war-torn region of darfur .

" the expulsions , rapes and murders that have taken place can not now be undone , " köhler told au envoys in the ethiopian capital addis ababa . the united nations and human rights groups have accused warring sides of massive human rights violations in darfur , a resource-rich region the size of france .
the conflict flared up in february 2003 , when rebels drawn from the black african population rose up against khartoum , complaining that their region has been marginalized . the uprising prompted a heavy-handed response from khartoum and its allied militia , leading to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives , displaced at least 1.6 million and spawned what the united nations has termed the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today .
in october , the au said it would boost the number of personnel monitoring a shaky truce signed in april from 465 to 3,320 , but it has yet to get enough men on the ground . still possibility for action köhler , who held talks earlier with au commission chairman alpha omar konare , urged the international community to assist the pan-african body in resolving the deadly darfur conflict . " i do n't think that the international community is helpless , " he said .
" the most important thing now is to listen very closely to what the au proposes about ways of settling the conflict , and it is on this basis that the international community should come together to finally resolve that conflict .

fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2004 opportunity or risk for deutsche börse ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse 's werner seifert again tries to take over the lse germany 's largest stock exchange , the deutsche börse in frankfurt , is attempting to take over the london stock exchange .
many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .

now that russia has ratified the pact and it goes into force next year , it is time to look beyond 2012 . the european union has always been a leading force at climate change negotiations .
as one of the early signatories to the kyoto protocol to reduce global warming , the eu has set itself up as an example for other regions of the world to follow .
in the past it has lobbied to convince skeptical nations to sign up to the pact .
it was instrumental in pressuring russia to ratify the treaty in november paving the way for it to become legally binding in january 2005 .
it has also been the most vocal critic of the us opposition to the protocol .
in its own backyard , the eu is on track to cut emissions by eight percent between 2008 and 2012 , owing largely to significant cuts made by germany and great britain under the bloc ’ s unique burden sharing agreement .
according to kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole reasearch center , although the efforts of the two countries are exemplary , the fact that the burden to reduce emissions rests on just a few countries , lets other eu members off the hook .
“ they need to do a lot more to really work with the rest of the community in terms of moving the bloc forward , ” ramakrishna said of the two leading emission cutters .
“ if the eu believes what it preaches , it needs to demonstrate that more at home , ” he said .
looking ahead at this year ’ s climate change conference , the eu focused attention on the period after 2012 , when the first stage of kyoto ends .
in an effort to speed up the process and begin defining new goals for the second phase , the eu has floated a plan to hold separate seminars in between the annual climate change conferences .
yvo de boer , deputy director general for the dutch environment ministry and head of the eu delegation in buenos aires , said it was time to look beyond the first stage of kyoto .
“ up until now , no one has been willing to talk about the future until the kyoto protocol had entered into force .
now that that has happened we can move forward . ”
leaving the us behind but the united states , which has rejected the kyoto protocol , remains the biggest obstacle to reducing global greenhouse gases .
as the world ’ s single largest polluter , the us has opposed any discussion on the second commitment period after 2012 .
green groups , therefore , have expressed doubt over the likelihood of success in further climate change negotiations .
they have also criticized the european union ’ s attempts to lure the us back into the kyoto process .
catherine pearce , a climate change campaigner for friends of the earth international , said europe needs to step forward and “ push the negotiations ahead in a far more positive way . ”
europe ’ s leadership role in the negotiations is undeniable , she said , pointing to countries like germany , britain and the netherlands .
but they need to be more active .
“ they need to step away from the united states and move much further and leave the us behind , ” she said . jennifer macey , buenos aires send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate control after kyoto with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic . the deutsche börse has offered € 1.95 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , four years after a similar attempt failed .
it could be the start of the long-awaited consolidation among europe 's stock exchanges .
but germany 's national bank , the bundesbank , seems to view a takeover with skepticism .
bundesbank board member hans reckers was concerned about frankfurt 's place in the financial world .
" the question must be asked in such a situation , just how frankfurt 's competitive strength can be secured , " reckers was quoted in the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
one cause for worry is just where the new super-bourse would have its headquarters , frankfurt or london .
deutsche börse 's chairman , werner seifert , has given no clear signal as to where the management would sit .
rivals might jump in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange , here the reception area , currently does not want to relocate to frankfurt .
meanwhile , the financial world is questioning the strength of the takeover attempt .
" deutsche börse has proposed a price which means value creation for acquiring exchanges will be difficult to realize , " analyst claire langevin at exane bnp paribas told reuters .
deutsche börse 's bid has been rejected by lse which said the offer was too low .
" a takeover is now just a question of time .
i think that frankfurt 's attempt is correct and the proper thing to do in a european market that is growing together , " financial expert and professor at the university of nuremberg-erlangen wolfgang gerke said in conversation with dw-world .
european competitors most likely will not stand and watch a takeover attempt .
they too will have to throw their hat in the ring for the lse , he said .
one of those is euronext .
home to the stock exchanges in paris , brussels , amsterdam and lisbon , euronext ranks as the smallest rival in europe .
langevin argued that if euronext stays out of the fight , it could pay the consequences , " it faces a large strategic loss and potential long-term pricing issues , " she said .
the price is right now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dax-lse fusion not for those with jittery nerves .
the current bid has put the competition in a pinch .
a bidding war with euronext , and possibly the nordic exchange group omx , the rising costs that go along with it and a likely stock issue to finance the takeover would test shareholder patience , analysts said .
" the 530p bid is sensible , but it should not be much more , " spokesman rolf drees at union investment told reuters .
" synergies " is the word in most experts ' mouths .
analyst pierre flabbee at kepler equities told news agencies that it would take one or two years before lse profits would help the börse 's earnings .
an initial heavy investment to merge lse and börse information technology would limit early potential .
should börse cave in to pressure from market participants to cut trading fees , something it indicated it would do when it launched the takeover approach , it would take even longer for synergies to filter through to its bottom line .
no matter the price , much is riding on the line for seifert .
traders are saying that the deutsche börse head would be ridiculed if another takeover failed again . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 what brussels really thinks about turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images like this one worry many in brussels , but they keep it quiet in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone . jokes about turkey are enjoying something of a boom in brussels right now , both among journalists and even among some politicians .
while during the numerous meetings of ambassadors , councils and the european commission , turkey 's accession is discussed in all seriousness , during breaks and behind-the-scenes conversations , everyone is eager to relate a best or worst story that took place while once on vacation in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional market stall in istanbul after that , it 's not unusual that stories extolling beautiful beaches turn into comparisons between recep tayyip erdogan and his government with carpet sellers , bazaar traders and vegetable sellers .
fears of the foreign and unfamiliar are often dressed up in stereotypes and coarse observations . " rich , arrogant , fat cats " of course , it 's all very politically incorrect , xenophobic , racist and who knows what else .
it 's precisely for these reasons that these observations do n't surface in official reporting or negotiation protocols .
they simmer in the backs of people 's minds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has its managers too it 's not much better the other way around .
ask some of the turks in brussels what kind of prejudices and stereotypes the turkish delegation fosters towards the bureaucrats in brussels , and they 'll tell you many are thought of as rich , arrogant fat cats who lead decadent , immoral lives . even after 40 years of attempts to get closer , brussels and ankara are still strangers .
that could be due to the fact that many correspondents do n't know turkey and the turks from first-hand experience .
for many germans , the image of turkey is still dominated by their experience of turkish immigrants , many of whom came from rural areas of anatolia with limited education and a tendency to stick closely to their own cultural circles . even for those in brussels who 've actually been to turkey , the image does n't improve much , often limited to the stereotype of gold-chained rip-off artist who preys on tourists in resort hotels . few know much about turkey 's up-and-coming business elite , the new hipsters with money to burn , the students in istanbul 's trendy neighborhoods or the successful businessman , who exports his products throughout the world . add to all that a hysterical fear of an emergent , " dangerous " islam , and the picture loses any semblance of truth . qualms brushed off it 's only now that accession talks are getting serious that people are beginning to consider what it will mean when the turks are part of the day-to-day workings of europe . turkish will become one of the official languages of the eu , and turkish civil servants will move into the brussels high-rises .
when turkey joins , it will likely be the most populated country in the eu and have a weighty voice when it comes to decisions .
the carefully balanced structure of the big four - germany , france , great britain and italy - could start to sway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long before turkey adds its star to the eu flag ?
those politicians who are deciding the fate of the eu and turkey often dispense with such concerns with remarks such as " well , at least you and i wo n't be around to see that .
anyway , turkey wo n't actually join for another 15 years . "
in other words , they are n't that convinced themselves , but have a devil-may-care attitude about it all . when the eu 's founders held out the carrot to turkey some 40 years ago , they probably had their own doubts , but the thinking was likely : " why worry about it anyway , it 's so far away … " now the chickens have come home to roost .
jean-claude juncker , luxemburg 's prime minister , formulated it well when he said : " no one is very enthusiastic , but no one has the heart to say it . " bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , france want turkey in eu germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .

the luxurious carriage was used from 1937 to 1941 as part of hitler 's personal train , which also included two passenger carriages , five sleeping carriages and two carriages just for luggage .
immediately after world war ii , the train was used by british forces before being returned to the german state railway in 1953 .
the first chancellor of west germany , konrad adenauer , travelled in the restaurant car to talks in moscow in 1955 , and his successor , willy brandt , had the train fitted with radio transmitting equipment for a visit to communist east germany in 1970 .
built in 1930 , the carriage was taken out of service in 1990 .
but in the next few days , the completely restored carriage will roll out of the workshops of the trainbuilders pfa in the northern bavarian town of weiden and head to the german steam train museum in nearby neuenmarkt . dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .
a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before .

the purpose of the academy is to invite muslims in germany to expand their political awareness .
nobody should be excluded , not even radical muslims . the muslim academy in germany celebrated its opening on wednesday .
the academy opens at a time when the german islamic community is being closely scrutinized by the public and the government .
this will be no different in the case of the muslim academy .
even german muslim associations are exercising a certain amount of skepticism towards the academy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy is housed in the werkstatt der kulturen -lrb- workshop of cultures -rrb- in berlin 's kreuzberg district nevertheless , abdul hadi christian hoffmann , president of the academy and a german who converted to islam , has not noticed any outright rejection from muslim groups .
hoffmann said all muslims are invited to come to the academy .
" we are not representative , " he added .
" we are not elected .
we are a group of muslims that have taken the initiative to offer educational opportunities .
we complement that what the -lsb- muslim -rsb- associations do .
we are not in competition with them . "
attending the ceremony were representatives from government , institutes of higher education and other bodies , including marieluise beck , federal commissioner for migration , refugees and integration .
beck said the academy should help make the diversity within the islamic community more visible .
she stressed that given the numerous prejudices towards muslims , " the language of reason must be given a voice . "

berlin 's former commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , barbara john , the islamic studies expert jamal malik and rabbi elisa klappheck also sit on the board .
this was something that the academy deliberately decided on doing .
so far , the reaction from the larger muslim organizations ranges from " interested to wait-and-see . "
claudia dantschke , a journalist who has written extensively about muslims in germany , said that the new academy could activate liberal and modern muslims around the country .
according to hoffmann , those who take little to no interest in traditional islam are responding to the opening of the academy .
" the interesting thing is that we have received e-mails , phone calls and letters after our first press conference from those muslims who are n't in organized groups , " he said .
" they were saying ' that 's the right step and finally something interesting where we can learn something . '

the investigation was being carried out in " close cooperation " with the regulatory authorities in britain and europe , the spokeswoman said .
bafin 's inquiry had already reached the " formal " stage , meaning that the findings from a preliminary probe had hardened the suspicions , she explained .
from there , the bafin could either decide to pass the case on to prosecutors , impose a fine itself or drop the investigation .
the bafin probe focuses on whether citigroup 's bond traders manipulated the bund -lrb- german government bonds -rrb- futures market on the eurex exchange in the summer .
under investigation are some controversial bond trades by citigroup in august . dw-world.de citigroup rejects merger with deutsche bank citigroup chief executive charles prince has ruled out the idea of merging with deutsche bank .

the investigation was being carried out in " close cooperation " with the regulatory authorities in britain and europe , the spokeswoman said .
bafin 's inquiry had already reached the " formal " stage , meaning that the findings from a preliminary probe had hardened the suspicions , she explained .
from there , the bafin could either decide to pass the case on to prosecutors , impose a fine itself or drop the investigation .
the bafin probe focuses on whether citigroup 's bond traders manipulated the bund -lrb- german government bonds -rrb- futures market on the eurex exchange in the summer .
under investigation are some controversial bond trades by citigroup in august . dw-world.de citigroup rejects merger with deutsche bank citigroup chief executive charles prince has ruled out the idea of merging with deutsche bank .

the luxurious carriage was used from 1937 to 1941 as part of hitler 's personal train , which also included two passenger carriages , five sleeping carriages and two carriages just for luggage .
immediately after world war ii , the train was used by british forces before being returned to the german state railway in 1953 .
the first chancellor of west germany , konrad adenauer , travelled in the restaurant car to talks in moscow in 1955 , and his successor , willy brandt , had the train fitted with radio transmitting equipment for a visit to communist east germany in 1970 .
built in 1930 , the carriage was taken out of service in 1990 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.12.2004 muslim academy opens doors in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope to supplement existing educational programs the first german muslim academy has opened its doors in berlin .
the purpose of the academy is to invite muslims in germany to expand their political awareness .
nobody should be excluded , not even radical muslims . the muslim academy in germany celebrated its opening on wednesday .
the academy opens at a time when the german islamic community is being closely scrutinized by the public and the government .
this will be no different in the case of the muslim academy .
even german muslim associations are exercising a certain amount of skepticism towards the academy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy is housed in the werkstatt der kulturen -lrb- workshop of cultures -rrb- in berlin 's kreuzberg district nevertheless , abdul hadi christian hoffmann , president of the academy and a german who converted to islam , has not noticed any outright rejection from muslim groups .
hoffmann said all muslims are invited to come to the academy .
" we are not representative , " he added .
" we are not elected .
we are a group of muslims that have taken the initiative to offer educational opportunities .
we complement that what the -lsb- muslim -rsb- associations do .
we are not in competition with them . "
attending the ceremony were representatives from government , institutes of higher education and other bodies , including marieluise beck , federal commissioner for migration , refugees and integration .
beck said the academy should help make the diversity within the islamic community more visible .
she stressed that given the numerous prejudices towards muslims , " the language of reason must be given a voice . "
at the same time , according to beck , " all the shady zones must be called by name . "
dialog between religions thomas krüger , the president of the federal agency for civic education , praised the future contribution of the academy in educating adult muslims .
in light of the rising " totalitarianism " within islam , krüger said he believes that " an open dialog of cultures would be the wrong path " to take .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. muhammad kalisch demands an intense dialogue between islam and other religions .
muhammad kalisch , professor for religious studies at the university of münster , countered that a dialog between the cultures - and one that is not " touchy-feely " - is necessary .
the academy must make the criticism directed towards muslims a topic .
in addition , muslims had to develop an " ability of self-criticism . "
composition of the academy 's board the board of directors of the academy is comprised of a broad spectrum of people from different political and religious backgrounds .
berlin 's former commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , barbara john , the islamic studies expert jamal malik and rabbi elisa klappheck also sit on the board .
this was something that the academy deliberately decided on doing .
so far , the reaction from the larger muslim organizations ranges from " interested to wait-and-see . "
claudia dantschke , a journalist who has written extensively about muslims in germany , said that the new academy could activate liberal and modern muslims around the country .
according to hoffmann , those who take little to no interest in traditional islam are responding to the opening of the academy .
" the interesting thing is that we have received e-mails , phone calls and letters after our first press conference from those muslims who are n't in organized groups , " he said .
" they were saying ' that 's the right step and finally something interesting where we can learn something . '
that means , that muslims who never took action to present their interests , are showing a great amount of interest for an academy that has an educational program .

nobody should be excluded , not even radical muslims . the muslim academy in germany celebrated its opening on wednesday .
the academy opens at a time when the german islamic community is being closely scrutinized by the public and the government .
this will be no different in the case of the muslim academy .
even german muslim associations are exercising a certain amount of skepticism towards the academy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the academy is housed in the werkstatt der kulturen -lrb- workshop of cultures -rrb- in berlin 's kreuzberg district nevertheless , abdul hadi christian hoffmann , president of the academy and a german who converted to islam , has not noticed any outright rejection from muslim groups .
hoffmann said all muslims are invited to come to the academy .
" we are not representative , " he added .
" we are not elected .
we are a group of muslims that have taken the initiative to offer educational opportunities .
we complement that what the -lsb- muslim -rsb- associations do .
we are not in competition with them . "
attending the ceremony were representatives from government , institutes of higher education and other bodies , including marieluise beck , federal commissioner for migration , refugees and integration .
beck said the academy should help make the diversity within the islamic community more visible .
she stressed that given the numerous prejudices towards muslims , " the language of reason must be given a voice . "

this was something that the academy deliberately decided on doing .
so far , the reaction from the larger muslim organizations ranges from " interested to wait-and-see . "
claudia dantschke , a journalist who has written extensively about muslims in germany , said that the new academy could activate liberal and modern muslims around the country .
according to hoffmann , those who take little to no interest in traditional islam are responding to the opening of the academy .
" the interesting thing is that we have received e-mails , phone calls and letters after our first press conference from those muslims who are n't in organized groups , " he said .

the investigation was being carried out in " close cooperation " with the regulatory authorities in britain and europe , the spokeswoman said .
bafin 's inquiry had already reached the " formal " stage , meaning that the findings from a preliminary probe had hardened the suspicions , she explained .
from there , the bafin could either decide to pass the case on to prosecutors , impose a fine itself or drop the investigation .
the bafin probe focuses on whether citigroup 's bond traders manipulated the bund -lrb- german government bonds -rrb- futures market on the eurex exchange in the summer .
under investigation are some controversial bond trades by citigroup in august . dw-world.de citigroup rejects merger with deutsche bank citigroup chief executive charles prince has ruled out the idea of merging with deutsche bank .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2004 combatting stereotypes with facts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking ahead to a good education though stereotypes about foreigners continue to proliferate in germany , a new study is challenging some beliefs about immigrant girls .
they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .
finding the balance between the two continues to be a matter of debate . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

the luxurious carriage was used from 1937 to 1941 as part of hitler 's personal train , which also included two passenger carriages , five sleeping carriages and two carriages just for luggage .
immediately after world war ii , the train was used by british forces before being returned to the german state railway in 1953 .
the first chancellor of west germany , konrad adenauer , travelled in the restaurant car to talks in moscow in 1955 , and his successor , willy brandt , had the train fitted with radio transmitting equipment for a visit to communist east germany in 1970 .
built in 1930 , the carriage was taken out of service in 1990 .
but in the next few days , the completely restored carriage will roll out of the workshops of the trainbuilders pfa in the northern bavarian town of weiden and head to the german steam train museum in nearby neuenmarkt . dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2004 eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu is likely to bring changes to turkey 's southeast for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry . the region has had more than its share of blood and tears since 1984 , when the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- took up arms against the government for self-rule , plunging the region into chaos .
but the atmosphere has changed dramatically over the past couple of years .
ankara , eager to catch up with european norms to ease its entry into the eu , introduced once-taboo reforms , allowing kurdish-language programs on the state broadcaster and the creation of private schools that teach kurdish . with more rights to their credit thanks to the eu , the kurds - whose very existence officialdom denied 10 years ago - are keeping their fingers crossed for a positive outcome from the dec .
16-17 summit of eu leaders who will decide whether to open membership talks with turkey . fears of rejection " i am hopeful that turkey will obtain a date that will pave the way for more positive changes in the region , " 43-year-old worker ahmet ataman said in diyarbakir , the main metropolis of turkey 's largely poor , kurdish-majority southeast .
" i fear the possibility that there will no date .
such a development will tear turkey away from europe , " he added . " i do not even want to consider that possibility , " said cevdet polat , an unemployed 29-year-old .
" that would butter the bread of those who oppose the eu . " hasan cemal , an experienced journalist who wrote a book on the bloody history of kurds in turkey , agreed that failure by eu leaders to open accession talks would be very costly for the region . " if there is no date , it will strengthen the hand of those who are against the eu and who flinch at the mere mention of kurds .
there will be a huge wave of anti-eu sentiment that will put a stop to democratic reforms , " cemal said .
such a development would also play into the hands of kurdish hawks bent on pursuing their armed struggle against ankara , he said .
bloody conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan more than 37,000 people died in the pkk 's armed campaign and the subsequent military crackdown in a bloody conflict that led to gross human rights violations on both sides , forced population movements , disappearances and summary executions . the rebels announced a unilateral truce in 1999 , shortly after their leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- was captured in kenya and convicted for treason in turkey .
but , the pkk - which changed names a few times and is now known as the kurdish peoples ' congress - ended the truce in june ; sporadic fighting has resumed since , but with far less intensity than before . " what we have now is controlled fighting , " said selahattin demirtas , the diyarbakir head of the turkish human rights association .
" but the lack of an eu perspective would erode hard-earned democratic rights , increase military operations and counter-attacks by the rebels .
" the result would be a return to the old atmosphere of violence , " he added . with the locals giving less support to armed kurdish rebels and rallying behind the government 's eu drive , renewed violence would only hurt a tentative rapprochement between the kurds and the state , which long resisted their demands to preserve their ethnic identity . " eu-minded reforms have led to relief in the region and drawn the kurds closer to the state , but there is a lot more the state can do to really make peace with kurds , " demirtas said .
" at this point , eu membership seems to be the only guarantee for more democratic openings from ankara , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what brussels really thinks about turkey in public , discussions by journalists and politicians over turkey 's possible membership in the eu are matter of fact and objective .
however , remarks made away from the mics and cameras can have a very different tone .

they 're far more ambitious and career aware than they 're given credit for . at a time when the debate over the integration of foreigners into german society dominates the national headlines - and stereotypes about immigrants persist - a study released on tuesday is helping to challenge some of the worst clichés . most notably , the study of 950 young immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 21 , performed at the request of the german ministry responsible for women 's affairs showed that young immigrant women are far more career aware and ambitious than stereotypes suggest .
however , they suffer from certain handicaps , though oppressive , traditional families - as stereotypes suggest - are not neccessarily one of them .
instead , insufficient language skills was named a culprit . the government 's integration commissioner , marieluise beck , said she hopes to use the results to push for better resources to help young immigrant women achieve their goals . education and training a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant girls are taking excellent notes of the women surveyed , who came from including yugoslavian , greek , turkish , italian and other backgrounds , the majority hoped to take advantage of germany 's education and training opportunities to pursue a career - in addition to starting a family .
according to the study , 83 percent planned to contribute financially to their fanily 's income . particularly in the case of young turkish immigrants , who are often stereotyped as traditional and family-oriented , the results challenged the cliches , beck pointed out at a press conference in berlin on tuesday . " in the political discussion , young women from muslim households are far too often unfairly assumed to be growing up in oppressive households , " added ursula boos-nünning , of the university of duisburg-essen , one of the co-authors of the study .
in fact , parents of muslim immigrants attach a great deal of importance to education , she added , though they themselves may be poorly educated and , therefore , unable to provide help with school assignments . more help overcoming handicaps in an effort to explain the girls ' comparatively poorer rates of success , the authors of the study blamed insufficient educational resources that do n't help young immigrants make up language deficits , particularly problematic since many do n't learn german until they enter school .
more than 72 percent of tho women surveyed said they first learned german in school .
" with such a system , those who come from underprivileged families , and particularly underprivileged immigrant families , will remain underprivileged , " said beck .
she called for more resources , including additional tutoring , to help young immigrant women overcome such handicaps . integration and tradition important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , education and tradition are important despite these challenges , the survey concluded , the immigrants believed their best future prospects were in germany .
they also still thought family and tradition was important . " in all aspects related to their ability to function in german society - the extent to which they were willing to make themselves understood , whether they sought out contact with the dominant culture - the young women questioned in the survey were strongly willing to integrate , " said yasemin karakasoglu of the universtiy of essen / duisburg , another co-author of the study . " but on points that would require them to distance themselves from their family and cultural tradition , they were far less willing to try and fit in , " she added . in short , the young women in the study said yes both to integration and tradition .

john ryan was sacked on tuesday from his job as head of bradford teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust amid forecasts of a deficit of over £ 11m .
an interim chairman was appointed after the regulator , monitor , used its powers for the first time .
it is not yet clear whether the board will mount a legal challenge .
but the vote , taken on tuesday night , meant the board intended to effectively defy the regulator 's decision , said bbc health correspondent karen allen .
they insisted that mr ryan , who had achieved top performance ratings for the hospital over several years , should not be forced to leave , she said .
the board plans to write to monitor requesting its chairman visit bradford to explain the reasons behind the decision .
these are very strong criticisms that are being made of bradford .
sue slipman foundation trust network estimates suggested the trust would run up £ 11.3m of debts this financial year .
the trust realised it was running into financial trouble in april but , according to monitor , did not respond fast enough and lacked a " strategic vision " of how to resolve the crisis .
peter garland , a former nhs regional director in the north of england , has been appointed as the trust 's interim chairman .
monitor 's chairman , william moyes , said : " we have concluded that the range of challenges facing the trust requires a change in leadership . "
sue slipman , director of the foundation trust network , which represents all the nhs trusts granted foundation status , said bradford was not the only trust to have difficulties and that others had agreed plans with the regulator to boost their performance .
' recovery plan ' it had proved difficult for trusts to make the transition to running their own affairs after being used to following centralised orders , she said .
she added : " bradford is clearly an extreme case and monitor has taken very strong action .
" what we all hope is that we can concentrate and focus around a robust recovery plan for bradford and bring them back within the terms of their authorisation as rapidly as possible . "
foundation trusts have been one of the major elements of the labour government 's nhs reforms .
they enjoy greater financial freedoms , but , unlike standard trusts , they can not turn to health authorities to bail them out if they run into trouble .
the bradford trust runs bradford royal infirmary and its other main hospital st luke 's , and employs 3,600 staff .
paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , criticised the " half-hearted " foundation hospital experiment .
he said : " the government 's foundation plans have failed to deliver the freedom and flexibility needed to let nhs staff innovate and get on with the job of treating patients . "

john ryan was sacked on tuesday from his job as head of bradford teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust amid forecasts of a deficit of over £ 11m .
an interim chairman was appointed after the regulator , monitor , used its powers for the first time .
it is not yet clear whether the board will mount a legal challenge .
but the vote , taken on tuesday night , meant the board intended to effectively defy the regulator 's decision , said bbc health correspondent karen allen .
they insisted that mr ryan , who had achieved top performance ratings for the hospital over several years , should not be forced to leave , she said .
the board plans to write to monitor requesting its chairman visit bradford to explain the reasons behind the decision .
these are very strong criticisms that are being made of bradford .
sue slipman foundation trust network estimates suggested the trust would run up £ 11.3m of debts this financial year .
the trust realised it was running into financial trouble in april but , according to monitor , did not respond fast enough and lacked a " strategic vision " of how to resolve the crisis .
peter garland , a former nhs regional director in the north of england , has been appointed as the trust 's interim chairman .
monitor 's chairman , william moyes , said : " we have concluded that the range of challenges facing the trust requires a change in leadership . "
sue slipman , director of the foundation trust network , which represents all the nhs trusts granted foundation status , said bradford was not the only trust to have difficulties and that others had agreed plans with the regulator to boost their performance .
' recovery plan ' it had proved difficult for trusts to make the transition to running their own affairs after being used to following centralised orders , she said .
she added : " bradford is clearly an extreme case and monitor has taken very strong action .
" what we all hope is that we can concentrate and focus around a robust recovery plan for bradford and bring them back within the terms of their authorisation as rapidly as possible . "
foundation trusts have been one of the major elements of the labour government 's nhs reforms .
they enjoy greater financial freedoms , but , unlike standard trusts , they can not turn to health authorities to bail them out if they run into trouble .
the bradford trust runs bradford royal infirmary and its other main hospital st luke 's , and employs 3,600 staff .
paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , criticised the " half-hearted " foundation hospital experiment .
he said : " the government 's foundation plans have failed to deliver the freedom and flexibility needed to let nhs staff innovate and get on with the job of treating patients . "

kim henderson has draped her middlesbrough home and gardens with displays featuring thousands of lights .
she wanted to attract visitors in the hope they would make donations to two hospice charities .
but council bosses have accused her of breaking the law by placing cardboard signs directing people to her house .
she placed three small handwritten signs on nearby roads directing potential visitors to her cul-de-sac home in the marton area of the town .

a council spokesman said : " it 's illegal to place signs which divert traffic .
they are unauthorised , they are illegal and that is the end of the matter .
" the danger of unilaterally deciding that you are going to divert a large number of vehicles into a residential area , is that you will get noise , pollution and it 's very dangerous .
" the time of year is entirely irrelevant .
it 's a dangerous thing to do . "
but mrs henderson said : " i 'm not advertising a business , a nightclub or anything like that .
" i 'm advertising for charity to raise money and not for myself . "
she said the lights were in aid of teesside hospice at the james cook hospital and care for the bereaved .
mrs henderson , who has already raised more than £ 1,000 , has removed the signs and is trying alternative methods of publicising her charity efforts .

kim henderson has draped her middlesbrough home and gardens with displays featuring thousands of lights .
she wanted to attract visitors in the hope they would make donations to two hospice charities .
but council bosses have accused her of breaking the law by placing cardboard signs directing people to her house .
she placed three small handwritten signs on nearby roads directing potential visitors to her cul-de-sac home in the marton area of the town .
but middlesbrough council says it will not tolerate mrs henderson 's actions .
mrs henderson 's garden is full of festive characters a council spokesman said : " it 's illegal to place signs which divert traffic .
they are unauthorised , they are illegal and that is the end of the matter .
" the danger of unilaterally deciding that you are going to divert a large number of vehicles into a residential area , is that you will get noise , pollution and it 's very dangerous .
" the time of year is entirely irrelevant .
it 's a dangerous thing to do . "
but mrs henderson said : " i 'm not advertising a business , a nightclub or anything like that .
" i 'm advertising for charity to raise money and not for myself . "
she said the lights were in aid of teesside hospice at the james cook hospital and care for the bereaved .
mrs henderson , who has already raised more than £ 1,000 , has removed the signs and is trying alternative methods of publicising her charity efforts .

the council said it was committed to ice hockey , but the devils ' owner said a temporary arena was not viable .

the club owner said he signed the present lease for the rink after agreeing with the council that a new home would be ready by the time it expired at the end of 2005 , and it " reneged " on that promise by offering only a temporary rink .
" we have 11 months remaining on our current lease with absolutely nowhere to go at all within the city or in the surrounding areas of our city , " he said .

we are actively seeking to relocate . "
" we have sought three possible sites within the city and one site on the outskirts .

cardiff council has said it was committed to providing facilities for ice hockey and was " actively progressing the delivery " of a new ice rink at the sports village .
in a statement , councillor nigel howells said : " if this permanent facility is not ready by the time the lease expires i can reassure residents that we will provide temporary facilities . "

building work on the new shopping centres - known as st david 's 2 - is due to start next spring .
it will include a john lewis store on the site of the rink .
" it 's all the livelihoods of everyone down here .
it would be a shame to see it fall by the wayside " shannon hope director of hockey for the devils a new rink is also to be built at the cardiff international sports village , but is not expected to be ready for at least another five years .
if mr phillips takes his case to court , work on the site of the rink could be delayed for months .
the club owner said he signed the present lease for the rink after agreeing with the council that a new home would be ready by the time it expired at the end of 2005 , and it " reneged " on that promise by offering only a temporary rink .
devils owner bob phillips says he will do whatever it takes " we have 11 months remaining on our current lease with absolutely nowhere to go at all within the city or in the surrounding areas of our city , " he said .
" we signed that lease to facilitate our move to the sports village , not to a temporary shed .
" you ca n't just re-locate 100 full- and part-time jobs that are currently here . "
" this facility is more important than another shopping centre within our city so we are prepared to do whatever it takes . "
" we are not saying we do n't want to move .
we are actively seeking to relocate . "
" we have sought three possible sites within the city and one site on the outskirts .
all we are seeking to do is talk to the council . "
" rinks around the country will rally with us to protest in anyway that we can to maintain cardiff at the highest level of ice hockey within great britain . "
devils fan martyn woodfield from cardiff said : " what is going to happen to the young people taking part in junior development ?
they will just end up on the street as the next nearest rink -lcb- for ice hockey -rsb- is in swindon . "
livelihoods devils ' director of hockey shannon hope said the club would rather find a solution to the disagreement than have a " war " with the council .
" but we will have to take it all the way , " he added .
" it 's all the livelihoods of everyone down here .
it would be a shame to see it fall by the wayside . "
demonstrators will protest outside cardiff county hall when councillors meet at 1400 gmt on wednesday .
cardiff council has said it was committed to providing facilities for ice hockey and was " actively progressing the delivery " of a new ice rink at the sports village .
in a statement , councillor nigel howells said : " if this permanent facility is not ready by the time the lease expires i can reassure residents that we will provide temporary facilities . "
" arrangements for operation of these permanent or temporary facilities will go out to tender under normal public procurement rules . "

dumfries msp elaine murray says the spread of the yellow flowering common ragwort has gone largely unchecked .
the bill would require farmers to remove ragwort growing next to equine pastures , as it can be deadly to horses .
conservationists are anxious not to wipe out the weed altogether as it is home to about 100 insect species .
code of practice ragwort is already one of five injurious plants listed in the 1959 weeds act , under which the government can compel landowners to take action .
ms murray wants to draw up a new code of practice for handling the weed similar to that in place in england and wales .
horses who eat ragwort can develop a fatal condition known as " the staggers " and about 500-1,000 animals are thought to die each year .
there is no evidence that the plant poses any risk to human health .

thought to be the only drawing of the fictional llareggub , it has been bought by the national library of wales .
seven personal items , including thomas ' passport and letters from his american contacts , give vivid glimpses of the welsh poet 's life .
the archive , in aberystwyth , will be on display until next month .
his scribbled notes can also be seen on some of the letters , where the names of racehorses compete with notes for chest linctus .
they will be of great interest to the general public as well as to specialists dr ceridwen lloyd-morgan , national library of wales other papers relating to his death list arrangements for the return of his body to wales and include a copy of the death certificate and of the american undertaker 's bill .

it is the map of llareggub , however , that will interest most of thomas ' fans worldwide .
the village name is a play on words and gains a whole new meaning when read backwards .
the rough sketch lists under milk wood characters polly garter , nogood boyo and lord cut glass living as neighbours in donkey street , with the waldos at cockle street which runs parallel to it .
the sea , complete with a roughly-sketched boat , borders the two streets .
the chapel marks one end of coronation street , the school and town hall the other .
the national library said the hand-drawn map revealed how thomas envisaged the setting for his cast of familiar but eccentric characters .
on the drawing , thomas even spells llareggub , llanreggub , which was obviously changed later .
his passport , marked ' deceased , ' comes complete with stamps for the united states , iran and czechoslovakia .
the passport is one of seven personal items purchased by the national library there is also a letter , dated december 1953 , from margaret taylor to stuart thomas - one of the trustees of the dylan thomas estate - listing the support she had given to the poet .
the owner of the boat house , in laugharne , where the thomases lived , she offers to sell it to thomas ' widow , caitlin , for £ 1,350 .

thought to be the only drawing of the fictional llareggub , it has been bought by the national library of wales .
seven personal items , including thomas ' passport and letters from his american contacts , give vivid glimpses of the welsh poet 's life .
the archive , in aberystwyth , will be on display until next month .
his scribbled notes can also be seen on some of the letters , where the names of racehorses compete with notes for chest linctus . "
they will be of great interest to the general public as well as to specialists " dr ceridwen lloyd-morgan , national library of wales other papers relating to his death list arrangements for the return of his body to wales and include a copy of the death certificate and of the american undertaker 's bill .
" the national library of wales is delighted to have acquired for the nation this important and little-known group of papers from the dylan thomas estate , " said dr ceridwen lloyd-morgan , head of the library 's manuscripts unit .
" they will be of great interest to the general public as well as to specialists . "
it is the map of llareggub , however , that will interest most of thomas ' fans worldwide .
the village name is a play on words and gains a whole new meaning when read backwards .
the rough sketch lists under milk wood characters polly garter , nogood boyo and lord cut glass living as neighbours in donkey street , with the waldos at cockle street which runs parallel to it .
the sea , complete with a roughly-sketched boat , borders the two streets .
the chapel marks one end of coronation street , the school and town hall the other .
the national library said the hand-drawn map revealed how thomas envisaged the setting for his cast of familiar but eccentric characters .

she issued the plea on the bbc 's crimewatch programme on tuesday night .
a burglar stole gems worth £ 2m despite being put in a headlock by sharon 's rock star husband ozzy at their home in chalfont st peter , bucks , last month .
in a pre-recorded message , sharon pleaded with viewers who knew the raider to " turn him in " .
she also revealed that she feels anxious being in the house following the incident .
' irreplaceable ' jewels items taken during the burglary included wedding rings , an engagement ring , pearl and diamond necklaces , a large 52-carat sapphire ring and two pairs of diamond earrings , which mrs osbourne says are " totally irreplaceable " .
" i hope that somebody out there realises that there 's a £ 100,000 reward for this jewellery " , she said .
" i hope that , because it 's near christmas and everybody needs cash for christmas ... this will spur somebody on to say : ' you know what ?
i know who did it and why not get the money ? " '
the reward is believed to be one of the biggest offered in criminal history .
calls to hotline the offender is described as 5ft 10in tall , light skinned , very slim and wearing a light jacket , dark trousers , trainers and a ski mask .
the show 's presenter , nick ross , later revealed that they had received 31 calls about the osbourne burglary , including one complaining that the show was only covering the case because of the family 's fame .
the message was pre-recorded as sharon osbourne , an x factor judge , was appearing at the royal variety performance on tuesday night with daughter kelly .
ozzy had to pull out of a planned performance at the last minute because he needs an operation to adjust a metal plate inserted in his shoulder after a quad bike crash last year .

she issued the plea on the bbc 's crimewatch programme on tuesday night .
a burglar stole gems worth £ 2m despite being put in a headlock by sharon 's rock star husband ozzy at their home in chalfont st peter , bucks , last month .
in a pre-recorded message , sharon pleaded with viewers who knew the raider to " turn him in " .
she also revealed that she feels anxious being in the house following the incident .
' irreplaceable ' jewels items taken during the burglary included wedding rings , an engagement ring , pearl and diamond necklaces , a large 52-carat sapphire ring and two pairs of diamond earrings , which mrs osbourne says are " totally irreplaceable " .
" i hope that somebody out there realises that there 's a £ 100,000 reward for this jewellery " , she said .
" i hope that , because it 's near christmas and everybody needs cash for christmas ... this will spur somebody on to say : ' you know what ?
i know who did it and why not get the money ? " '
the reward is believed to be one of the biggest offered in criminal history .
calls to hotline the offender is described as 5ft 10in tall , light skinned , very slim and wearing a light jacket , dark trousers , trainers and a ski mask .
the show 's presenter , nick ross , later revealed that they had received 31 calls about the osbourne burglary , including one complaining that the show was only covering the case because of the family 's fame .
the message was pre-recorded as sharon osbourne , an x factor judge , was appearing at the royal variety performance on tuesday night with daughter kelly .
ozzy had to pull out of a planned performance at the last minute because he needs an operation to adjust a metal plate inserted in his shoulder after a quad bike crash last year .

a burglar stole gems worth £ 2m despite being put in a headlock by sharon 's rock star husband ozzy at their home in chalfont st peter , bucks , last month .

' irreplaceable ' jewels items taken during the burglary included wedding rings , an engagement ring , pearl and diamond necklaces , a large 52-carat sapphire ring and two pairs of diamond earrings , which mrs osbourne says are " totally irreplaceable " .
" i hope that somebody out there realises that there 's a £ 100,000 reward for this jewellery " , she said .
" i hope that , because it 's near christmas and everybody needs cash for christmas ... this will spur somebody on to say : ' you know what ?
i know who did it and why not get the money ? " '

the scientist - who works at birmingham heartlands hospital - has developed a new test that should help doctors identify the bacterium more quickly .
mrsa is resistant to nearly all antibiotics , with screening of patients taking as long as two days .
but the new test could cut that to two hours , helping to stop it spreading .
mrsa mrsa -lrb- methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- first appeared in the 1960s some strains are resistant to almost all known antibiotics cases have increased by 600 % in the past decade cases are expected to double again in the next six years efforts to combat it cost the nhs £ 1bn a year holland 's zero tolerance approach the test can identify a particular strain of mrsa , giving a detailed picture of its genetic structure , which researchers say will make it easier to discover the source of the infection .
but the test is regarded as expensive , costing £ 15 per patient .
current testing costs between £ 5 to £ 8 .
professor peter hawkey , the researcher who developed the test , said : " by doing a test which takes two to three hours , it would be possible to release that patient , if they are not colonised -lsb- with mrsa -rsb- , from isolation . "
the test has so far only been evaluated in the lab , so further research must now take place in a hospital before it can be decided if the test should be widely introduced .
the national audit office estimates infections such as mrsa kill 5,000 people each year .
hospital-acquired infections cost the nhs around £ 1 billion a year .
target meanwhile doctors and scientists from around the world are meeting at the royal college of pathologists in london for a major conference on tackling hospital-acquired infections like mrsa .
health secretary john reid , speaking at the conference , announced the results of the second round of equipment , materials and products which could help nhs staff improve infection control in hospitals .
delegates will also discuss how the government 's £ 3m budget for research into mrsa should be spent .
last month , mr reid announced radical targets for mrsa , demanding the number of bloodstream infections be halved by march 2008 .
the health secretary told the bbc : " i said we would leave no stone unturned in the fight against the superbug and , so far , we have introduced a whole series of steps to do with cleanliness and design and separation in single rooms and hygiene and so on .
" but we have to marshal science as well . "
shadow health minister simon burns said : " infection control nurses have said they want less expert advice but independent authority to shut down infected , dirty wards .
" whilst action is needed to stop 5,000 people dying every year , john reid chooses to hold another meeting to talk - again - about what to do .
less talk and more action is urgently needed to tackle the mrsa hospital superbug . "
paul burstow , liberal democrat health spokesman , added : " the government talks tough on superbugs but its record on tackling hospital infections is sadly lacking .
" the government has to adopt a zero tolerance on poor hygiene and a search and destroy approach to tackling superbugs with robust screening and isolation . "

the scientist - who works at birmingham heartlands hospital - has developed a new test that should help doctors identify the bacterium more quickly .
mrsa is resistant to nearly all antibiotics , with screening of patients taking as long as two days .
but the new test could cut that to two hours , helping to stop it spreading .
mrsa mrsa -lrb- methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- first appeared in the 1960s some strains are resistant to almost all known antibiotics cases have increased by 600 % in the past decade cases are expected to double again in the next six years efforts to combat it cost the nhs £ 1bn a year holland 's zero tolerance approach the test can identify a particular strain of mrsa , giving a detailed picture of its genetic structure , which researchers say will make it easier to discover the source of the infection .
but the test is regarded as expensive , costing £ 15 per patient .
current testing costs between £ 5 to £ 8 .
professor peter hawkey , the researcher who developed the test , said : " by doing a test which takes two to three hours , it would be possible to release that patient , if they are not colonised -lsb- with mrsa -rsb- , from isolation . "
the test has so far only been evaluated in the lab , so further research must now take place in a hospital before it can be decided if the test should be widely introduced .
the national audit office estimates infections such as mrsa kill 5,000 people each year .
hospital-acquired infections cost the nhs around £ 1 billion a year .
target meanwhile doctors and scientists from around the world are meeting at the royal college of pathologists in london for a major conference on tackling hospital-acquired infections like mrsa .
health secretary john reid , speaking at the conference , announced the results of the second round of equipment , materials and products which could help nhs staff improve infection control in hospitals .
delegates will also discuss how the government 's £ 3m budget for research into mrsa should be spent .
last month , mr reid announced radical targets for mrsa , demanding the number of bloodstream infections be halved by march 2008 .
the health secretary told the bbc : " i said we would leave no stone unturned in the fight against the superbug and , so far , we have introduced a whole series of steps to do with cleanliness and design and separation in single rooms and hygiene and so on .
" but we have to marshal science as well . "
shadow health minister simon burns said : " infection control nurses have said they want less expert advice but independent authority to shut down infected , dirty wards .
" whilst action is needed to stop 5,000 people dying every year , john reid chooses to hold another meeting to talk - again - about what to do .
less talk and more action is urgently needed to tackle the mrsa hospital superbug . "
