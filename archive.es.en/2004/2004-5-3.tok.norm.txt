sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

speaking to the bbc , prodi said : " i think the political consequences would be heavy .
i do n't know now what ' heavy ' will mean in legal terms . "
certainly , he continued , " what is clear is that after many years ' debate on the constitution , you can ’ t think that the debate has not taken place . "
if you say ' no ' to this , he told the broadcaster , " politically it is not the same thing as saying ' no ' to a treaty written in one night . "
in a separate interview with the bbc , prodi described as " undemocratic " the possibility of one country holding the others up .
" when we are many member states , it 's difficult to conceive a union in which one country can veto all the others ...
this is a completely undemocratic process . "

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .

" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .

" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .

" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .

but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes .

a hyundai official denied a report that hyundai would buy back the stake from the stuttgart-based group , but told reuters : " as far as we know , the german carmaker is seeking to sell the stake via a block sale to other buyers . "
the german business daily handelsblatt cited industry sources on monday as saying daimlerchrysler would sell to hyundai .
a sale would mark daimlerchrysler 's second major reversal in asian strategy in as many months after the group cut off financial support to beleaguered japanese partner mitsubishi last month .
hyundai said last week it was planning to scale back its partnership with daimlerchrsyler to work on a " project-by-project " basis rather than in a full alliance . more briefs 03.05.2004 -pipe- siemens seals groundbreaking patent deal with microsoft 02.05.2004 -pipe- german media groups plan to merge printing operations 02.05.2004 -pipe- siemens to sell mobile phones in china 30.04.2004 -pipe- minister urges new eu members to raise taxes 30.04.2004 -pipe- government slashes economic growth forecast 30.04.2004 -pipe- weber appointed bundesbank president 29.04.2004 -pipe- german tax revenue to fall short for next two years 29.04.2004 -pipe- ackermann 's lawyers protest at damage to client 's image radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .

the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade . wen was received by schröder at the berlin chancellery on monday during a four-day visit to germany focused on promoting german business ties with china . in one of the most unequivocal statements to date , schröder said the german government agreed with china over its taiwan policy .
" the german government is opposed to the independence of taiwan , " schröder said in a joint statement .
" it is also opposed to all steps that are aimed at intensifying tensions in the streets of taiwan , " it read . most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since a 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and has threatened it with war if it formally declares independence .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to chinese reunification attempts until china has a democratically elected government . german human rights groups and left-wing lawmakers have urged schröder in the past to press china on human rights issues .
the government says human rights are best promoted by supporting economic and political reform in china . germany appreciates " the provisions for human rights in the constitution of the people 's republic of china , " monday 's statement said , adding that the relationship between the two countries " is a good basis for an open conversation . . . on differences of opinion . " schröder in favor of easing arms sanctions schröder also spoke in favor of lifting the arms embargo on china , but added that in the end it was for the eu to make the final decision .
the arms embargo was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre . during his visit to china last december , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision should hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records . compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo . the joint declaration in berlin on monday however welcomed new chinese restrictions on exports of missile , nuclear and biological technologies that can be used to make or deliver weapons of mass destruction . china has been under pressure to stop what u.s. officials say is the transfer of missile and weapons technology by chinese companies to iran , pakistan and other countries . the statement also lauded china for its " commitment to a solution to the nuclear question on the korean peninsula . " business tops the agenda on monday , schröder and wen also pledged to strengthen economic ties , particularly in high technology and to double bilateral trade by 2010 from a current € 50 billion yearly . earlier monday , wen toured a siemens ag plant that makes power generating equipment that the german company wants to sell to china .
he also presided over a deal for daimlerchrysler to make mercedes cars with a partner in beijing . during wen 's visit to a siemens power turbine plant in berlin , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer said germany 's largest electronics and engineering company hopes to exploit rising demand for power generation in china for orders . china adds the equivalent of a quarter of germany 's electricity production capacity every year and is looking at all energy sources , including nuclear , oil , hydroelectric and gas , von pierer said . china is a " booming market , " von pierer said as wen toured the plant .
the visit could be could be the start of a " very good cooperation , " he said . daimlerchrysler to build cars in china also during wen 's visit , daimlerchrysler announced a government go-ahead for a key part of the chinese approval process for plans to build mercedes c- and e-class cars at a new factory in beijing with chinese partner baic ltd . the german-u.s. automaker is joining german rivals volkswagen and bmw in seeking a stronger foothold in the booming chinese market . the beijing plant would have an initial production capacity of 25,000 vehicles , which would be built from kits shipped by mercedes-benz , the company said . approval for the project from the chinese national development and reform commission is a major step toward approval for the beijing plant , daimlerchrysler said .
" establishing a manufacturing presence for mercedes-benz passenger cars in china is a key part of our asian strategy , and further complements our activities in the chinese market , " ceo schrempp said in a statement . on sunday , volkswagen announced plans for a new shanghai factory as wen began his visit , part of the automaker 's plans to invest € 5.3 billion -lrb- us $ 6.35 billion -rrb- in china in the next five years . vw plans to expand to expand its shanghai operations with a new factory that can produce 150,000 cars annually . wen 's european trip also includes stops in belgium , italy , britain and ireland . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese prime minister focuses on trade during german visit wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes . " the planned legislation will now apply to all businesses with over ten employees - german brothels included - if they fail to train less than seven percent of their workforce . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade . wen was received by schröder at the berlin chancellery on monday during a four-day visit to germany focused on promoting german business ties with china . in one of the most unequivocal statements to date , schröder said the german government agreed with china over its taiwan policy .
" the german government is opposed to the independence of taiwan , " schröder said in a joint statement .
" it is also opposed to all steps that are aimed at intensifying tensions in the streets of taiwan , " it read . most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since a 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and has threatened it with war if it formally declares independence .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to chinese reunification attempts until china has a democratically elected government . german human rights groups and left-wing lawmakers have urged schröder in the past to press china on human rights issues .
the government says human rights are best promoted by supporting economic and political reform in china . germany appreciates " the provisions for human rights in the constitution of the people 's republic of china , " monday 's statement said , adding that the relationship between the two countries " is a good basis for an open conversation . . . on differences of opinion . " schröder in favor of easing arms sanctions schröder also spoke in favor of lifting the arms embargo on china , but added that in the end it was for the eu to make the final decision .
the arms embargo was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre . during his visit to china last december , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision should hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records . compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo . the joint declaration in berlin on monday however welcomed new chinese restrictions on exports of missile , nuclear and biological technologies that can be used to make or deliver weapons of mass destruction . china has been under pressure to stop what u.s. officials say is the transfer of missile and weapons technology by chinese companies to iran , pakistan and other countries . the statement also lauded china for its " commitment to a solution to the nuclear question on the korean peninsula . " business tops the agenda on monday , schröder and wen also pledged to strengthen economic ties , particularly in high technology and to double bilateral trade by 2010 from a current € 50 billion yearly . earlier monday , wen toured a siemens ag plant that makes power generating equipment that the german company wants to sell to china .
he also presided over a deal for daimlerchrysler to make mercedes cars with a partner in beijing . during wen 's visit to a siemens power turbine plant in berlin , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer said germany 's largest electronics and engineering company hopes to exploit rising demand for power generation in china for orders . china adds the equivalent of a quarter of germany 's electricity production capacity every year and is looking at all energy sources , including nuclear , oil , hydroelectric and gas , von pierer said . china is a " booming market , " von pierer said as wen toured the plant .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .

the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade . wen was received by schröder at the berlin chancellery on monday during a four-day visit to germany focused on promoting german business ties with china . in one of the most unequivocal statements to date , schröder said the german government agreed with china over its taiwan policy .
" the german government is opposed to the independence of taiwan , " schröder said in a joint statement .
" it is also opposed to all steps that are aimed at intensifying tensions in the streets of taiwan , " it read . most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since a 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and has threatened it with war if it formally declares independence .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to chinese reunification attempts until china has a democratically elected government . german human rights groups and left-wing lawmakers have urged schröder in the past to press china on human rights issues .

although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision should hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records . compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo . the joint declaration in berlin on monday however welcomed new chinese restrictions on exports of missile , nuclear and biological technologies that can be used to make or deliver weapons of mass destruction . china has been under pressure to stop what u.s. officials say is the transfer of missile and weapons technology by chinese companies to iran , pakistan and other countries . the statement also lauded china for its " commitment to a solution to the nuclear question on the korean peninsula . " business tops the agenda on monday , schröder and wen also pledged to strengthen economic ties , particularly in high technology and to double bilateral trade by 2010 from a current € 50 billion yearly . earlier monday , wen toured a siemens ag plant that makes power generating equipment that the german company wants to sell to china .
he also presided over a deal for daimlerchrysler to make mercedes cars with a partner in beijing . during wen 's visit to a siemens power turbine plant in berlin , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer said germany 's largest electronics and engineering company hopes to exploit rising demand for power generation in china for orders . china adds the equivalent of a quarter of germany 's electricity production capacity every year and is looking at all energy sources , including nuclear , oil , hydroelectric and gas , von pierer said . china is a " booming market , " von pierer said as wen toured the plant .
the visit could be could be the start of a " very good cooperation , " he said . daimlerchrysler to build cars in china also during wen 's visit , daimlerchrysler announced a government go-ahead for a key part of the chinese approval process for plans to build mercedes c- and e-class cars at a new factory in beijing with chinese partner baic ltd . the german-u.s. automaker is joining german rivals volkswagen and bmw in seeking a stronger foothold in the booming chinese market . the beijing plant would have an initial production capacity of 25,000 vehicles , which would be built from kits shipped by mercedes-benz , the company said . approval for the project from the chinese national development and reform commission is a major step toward approval for the beijing plant , daimlerchrysler said .
" establishing a manufacturing presence for mercedes-benz passenger cars in china is a key part of our asian strategy , and further complements our activities in the chinese market , " ceo schrempp said in a statement . on sunday , volkswagen announced plans for a new shanghai factory as wen began his visit , part of the automaker 's plans to invest € 5.3 billion -lrb- us $ 6.35 billion -rrb- in china in the next five years . vw plans to expand to expand its shanghai operations with a new factory that can produce 150,000 cars annually . wen 's european trip also includes stops in belgium , italy , britain and ireland . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese prime minister focuses on trade during german visit wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .

whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .

hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .

the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do . " we ca n't just tell them fairytales , " one opponent to the new curricula told german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rules home schooling unacceptable parents may not keep their children from attending school even if they give them lessons at home , a district court in giessen ruled wednesday .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .

" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .

the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade . wen was received by schröder at the berlin chancellery on monday during a four-day visit to germany focused on promoting german business ties with china . in one of the most unequivocal statements to date , schröder said the german government agreed with china over its taiwan policy .
" the german government is opposed to the independence of taiwan , " schröder said in a joint statement .
" it is also opposed to all steps that are aimed at intensifying tensions in the streets of taiwan , " it read . most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since a 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and has threatened it with war if it formally declares independence .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to chinese reunification attempts until china has a democratically elected government . german human rights groups and left-wing lawmakers have urged schröder in the past to press china on human rights issues .
the government says human rights are best promoted by supporting economic and political reform in china . germany appreciates " the provisions for human rights in the constitution of the people 's republic of china , " monday 's statement said , adding that the relationship between the two countries " is a good basis for an open conversation . . . on differences of opinion . " schröder in favor of easing arms sanctions schröder also spoke in favor of lifting the arms embargo on china , but added that in the end it was for the eu to make the final decision .
the arms embargo was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre . during his visit to china last december , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision should hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records . compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo . the joint declaration in berlin on monday however welcomed new chinese restrictions on exports of missile , nuclear and biological technologies that can be used to make or deliver weapons of mass destruction . china has been under pressure to stop what u.s. officials say is the transfer of missile and weapons technology by chinese companies to iran , pakistan and other countries . the statement also lauded china for its " commitment to a solution to the nuclear question on the korean peninsula . " business tops the agenda on monday , schröder and wen also pledged to strengthen economic ties , particularly in high technology and to double bilateral trade by 2010 from a current € 50 billion yearly . earlier monday , wen toured a siemens ag plant that makes power generating equipment that the german company wants to sell to china .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .

responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .

göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes . " the planned legislation will now apply to all businesses with over ten employees - german brothels included - if they fail to train less than seven percent of their workforce . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the chinese connection germany and china celebrate 30 years of ties mercedes , made in china transrapid diplomacy german-chinese business relations boom germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strengthening ties - wen jiabao , left , with chancellor schröder chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .
the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade . wen was received by schröder at the berlin chancellery on monday during a four-day visit to germany focused on promoting german business ties with china . in one of the most unequivocal statements to date , schröder said the german government agreed with china over its taiwan policy .
" the german government is opposed to the independence of taiwan , " schröder said in a joint statement .
" it is also opposed to all steps that are aimed at intensifying tensions in the streets of taiwan , " it read . most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since a 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and has threatened it with war if it formally declares independence .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to chinese reunification attempts until china has a democratically elected government . german human rights groups and left-wing lawmakers have urged schröder in the past to press china on human rights issues .
the government says human rights are best promoted by supporting economic and political reform in china . germany appreciates " the provisions for human rights in the constitution of the people 's republic of china , " monday 's statement said , adding that the relationship between the two countries " is a good basis for an open conversation . . . on differences of opinion . " schröder in favor of easing arms sanctions schröder also spoke in favor of lifting the arms embargo on china , but added that in the end it was for the eu to make the final decision .
the arms embargo was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre . during his visit to china last december , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision should hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records . compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo . the joint declaration in berlin on monday however welcomed new chinese restrictions on exports of missile , nuclear and biological technologies that can be used to make or deliver weapons of mass destruction . china has been under pressure to stop what u.s. officials say is the transfer of missile and weapons technology by chinese companies to iran , pakistan and other countries . the statement also lauded china for its " commitment to a solution to the nuclear question on the korean peninsula . " business tops the agenda on monday , schröder and wen also pledged to strengthen economic ties , particularly in high technology and to double bilateral trade by 2010 from a current € 50 billion yearly . earlier monday , wen toured a siemens ag plant that makes power generating equipment that the german company wants to sell to china .

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .

italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do . " we ca n't just tell them fairytales , " one opponent to the new curricula told german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rules home schooling unacceptable parents may not keep their children from attending school even if they give them lessons at home , a district court in giessen ruled wednesday .

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .
in the course of a conference entitled " teaching evolution : a fairytale for the schools , " parliamentarian pietro cerullo linked darwin 's theory to leftist thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles darwin poses in a wicker chair in 1875 .
italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do . " we ca n't just tell them fairytales , " one opponent to the new curricula told german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rules home schooling unacceptable parents may not keep their children from attending school even if they give them lessons at home , a district court in giessen ruled wednesday .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .

italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes . " the planned legislation will now apply to all businesses with over ten employees - german brothels included - if they fail to train less than seven percent of their workforce . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "

sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend . it seems that reigning german soccer champions bayern munich have more than a six point deficit to overcome to regain their dignity and retain their title . a trip to a psychotherapist may be in order for a number of the club 's most senior officials after comments made by the club manager and chairman hinted at feelings of paranoia creeping through the corridors of power at germany 's biggest club .
the apparent manifestation of a collective persecution complex marred a victorious weekend which kept bayern in touch with league leaders werder bremen . rather than concentrating on the fact that bayern 's 2-1 win over bottom club cologne kept the heat on the top team as this year 's close championship race goes to the last three games , bayern munich manager uli hoeness preferred to focus on the " peculiar " way hamburg sv rolled over for bremen on saturday . ignoring the possibility that werder had produced a stunning performance to beat klaus toppmöller 's side 6-0 on their own turf , hoeness stopped short of claiming bremen 's win in hamburg had been rigged , but he was nonetheless crushed by the outcome . bayern coach bemoans outcome " i do n't understand it .
it 's catastrophic that such a thing can happen , " fumed the bayern manager of 25 years at a press conference .
" that was really disgusting of hamburg .
their performance was a disaster and a real shame hamburg decided the championship a few years ago by losing 5-0 in bremen . " in the 1993/94 season , bremen overtook bayern on goal difference one game before the end of the season thanks to a 5-0 triumph over hamburg before sealing the championship with a final-day victory .
hoeness had obviously not forgotten or forgiven that event . it was a popular subject among conspiracy theorists at the time that hamburg had done their close rivals a favor for the sake of pride in the north of germany and to help prise the bundesliga crown away from bavaria .
far from making such an obvious and explosive point himself , however , hoeness questioned hamburg 's commitment in a game which ultimately helped to extend bremen 's superior goal difference to twelve over second-placed bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " it 's very peculiar for hsv to allow themselves to be slaughtered in such a way , " hoeness -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" that is n't fine .
the people responsible at hamburg have got to ask themselves whether that 's right in this phase of the season . " coach ottmar hitzfeld reacted more mildly , but also suggested that hamburg had not tried very hard .
" a team who sound so confident before such a game should have more to offer in the game itself , " hitzfeld said . far from " fair play " ? bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge was not so forgiving .
the former world cup winning player called the hamburg performance " absolutely unacceptable " and suggested that the spirit in which hsv lost to bremen was " far from fair play . " it was apparent in his comments that the long-standing animosity between bayern and hamburg had not only been festering in his colleague 's office at bayern 's central headquarters .
" we are still extreme annoyed .
this is a damn scandal , " rummenigge railed .
" it has done gigantic damage to german football and the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmoeller hamburg sv coach klaus toppmöller -lrb- photo -rrb- revealed his shame and embarrassment at saturday 's result .
" our performance was absolutely embarrassing .
no-one should lose like that .
i 'm very very disappointed , " the former bayer leverkusen coach admitted .
" there is nothing to say after such a performance .
what hurts most is that we have harmed other clubs , in this case bayern munich .
there was so much hanging on that match , it 's all so unbelievable . "
toppmöller did not deny the accusations of unprofessionalism coming from bayern and said : " hsv is not average for nothing .
this is the low point of my career as a coach . "
the hsv coach is now expected to demand funds for new players in the summer , complaining that the attitude of current players is suspect . clash of the titans back in munich , talk soon turned to revenge and the match which could be seen as the championship decider .
bayern and bremen meet at the olympic stadium on saturday in the biggest game of the season .
if werder win , their lead will be unassailable , if bayern are victorious then the season will once again go to the wire . " we are even more ready for them , " said rummenigge .
" the team knows what is required .
there will be no special treatment . " hoeness knows a comprehensive victory is the only remaining way of taking the championship down to the final two games .
" we will find out in that game how nervous werder are .
we will also see who the best team in germany are , " hoeness said .

with an eye on the well-being of prostitutes , germany 's greens want to exclude brothels from a planned law penalizing businesses failing to offer sufficient traineeships .
but their noble intentions have been dashed . true to their party 's social-conscious credentials , a few green parliamentarians last week insisted that the country 's prostitutes would be adversely affected by a law that will penalize businesses that fail to offer sufficient traineeships .
they demanded that brothels thus be excluded from the legislation , which is designed to create more job training for young people . since the fines will apply to companies that are required to provide social security cover for employees , the greens fear that businesses operating in the red light area would feel even less compelled to register prostitutes for social insurance . but after much debate , the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens agreed that brothel owners should be forced to pay up if they fail to offer sufficient traineeships for waiters or sales employees .
there was no explicit mention of prostitutes . the federal education ministry said in a statement that an attempt to exclude brothels from the legislation would run " into major difficulties . " it also added that making a special exception for bordellos was problematic because it was impossible to strictly differentiate between conventional brothels and nightclubs . the ministry added that the green demand was also unrealistic because " until now there have hardly been proper employment contracts with the necessary social insurance cover for prostitutes .

following massive protests , italy 's pupils will continue to be taught the theory of evolution . italy 's creationists were jubilant until italian education minister letizia moratti flip-flopped on cutting the theory of evolution from national school curricula last week .
moratti claimed she never planned to remove it from teaching syllabi .
in that case , it 's unclear how tens of thousands of people got it in their heads to appeal to her not to rid schools of charles darwin 's theories . " discussion of darwin 's theories is guaranteed for all children from six to 18 years , " moratti said friday .
she added that a commission would be established to decide on details about how it would be taught .
nobel prize laureate rita levi montalcini , 95 , is set to head the body . just for scientists italy was in an uproar for weeks after the education ministry released reworked national curricula that left the theory of evolution out of secondary schools .
" pupils aged 10 to 13 are much too young to be confronted with such complicated material , " director general silvio criscuoli , who was responsible for the teaching plans , explained .
only older pupils who specialized in natural science would have learned about the theory of evolution . education minister moratti defended the change by explaining that pupils should learn about the origin of species gradually , according to " didactic criteria . "
that is , they would first learn the biblical version of the creation and , only years later , the scientific theory . fairytales but , as in the united states , creation and evolution are political issues in italy .
in february , alleanza nazionale , one of parties in prime minister silvio berlusconi 's governing coalition , held a week long series of events to dispute the theory of evolution .

italian evolutionists quickly mobilized against the plans to relegate darwin to history .
critics were particularly concerned that the changes would effect children at an age when they are forming the basis of their understanding of the world , at 13 and 14 .
within days , more than 50,000 people , including numerous nobel prize winners and renowned scientists , signed an appeal in la repubblica newspaper against the " damage to scientific culture " that they said omitting darwin from schools would do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2004 berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic doldrums are a conundrum for the government .
plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth . a number of newspapers and tv stations reported over the weekend that german chancellor gerhard schröder is considering spending billions of euros on an education and research package aimed at jumpstarting the lagging economy .
but to finance the program , the government would have to abandon its course of fiscal austerity .
responding to the uproar on monday , economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel said the government would continue to go the course with its fiscal consolidation and reform policies .
eichel said the reports were " fundamentally false , " adding schröder had already announced the government 's program last autumn and that it would be funded through previously slated subsidy cuts .
government spokesman bela anda also denied the government was planning to conduct a u-turn on its fiscal policies , but reiterated that there " ca n't be any lasting growth without consolidation , but also that there ca n't be any successful consolidation without growth . "
shrinking growth , labor market on friday , the government sank its economic growth forecast from 1.7 percent to 1.5 for the year , and said that the number of unemployed would only drop by about 20,000 and the number of working germans would actually drop by 80,000 from the previous year .
the latest wave of negative statistics helped sparked the discussion that berlin would be willing to abandon its fiscal discipline in order to get the economy back on track .
" we 're going to discuss the financing possibilities , " katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary group leader for the green party told reuters .
with the scope of the expected budget gap , " it wo n't be possible to make up for it with further cuts and savings to the budget . "
göring-eckardt said that although the government was not planning a fundamental change to its policy , it is in a " very , very difficult situation with its budget policy . "
the question , she said , was how the government could continue with its consolidation course while at the same time remaining politically viable .
opposition : schröder 's ' banana republic ' the mixed signals coming out of the chancellery and government ministries in berlin sent opposition politicians onto the offensive on monday .
friedrich merz , deputy parliamentary group leader for the conservative christian democratic union accused the government of running a " banana republic . "
germany currently has the greatest deficit in its history and the highest level of unemployment , merz said , before going on to accuse schröder 's government of allowing high deficits and " giving away the savings accounts of our children to plunderers . "
cdu chief angela merkel also called on schröder to issue a " clear position this week " on the future of the government 's budget and economic policy . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

mexico and peru have both said they will withdraw their ambassadors from cuba following scathing remarks by the communist state 's leader , fidel castro .
mexico , once cuba 's strongest ally in latin america , accused havana of interfering in its affairs and said it was expelling the cuban ambassador .
peru cited " offensive " remarks made by the cuban leader in a may day speech .
president castro had condemned states which backed a recent united nations censure of cuba 's human rights record .
" the peruvian government energetically rejects offensive remarks made by the cuban head of state with regard to peru , " the foreign ministry in lima said on sunday , and warned of " consequences for bilateral relations " .
' meddling ' in mexico city , foreign secretary luis ernesto derbez told reporters that diplomatic ties with havana were being reduced to the level of charges d 'affaires following the may day speech .
interior secretary santiago creel , who appeared with him at a news conference , said it had also been discovered that cuban communist party members had entered mexico on diplomatic passports in april and held an unspecified " political reunion " without going through diplomatic channels .
we believe the lacerating level this conflict has reached is totally unecessary el universal mexican newspaper row dominates front pages mr derbez added that president vicente fox 's decision to downgrade relations had also been taken after cuban officials made allegations that the president was trying to discredit a key political rival , mayor of mexico city andres manuel lopez obrador .
he said mexico had to " conclude that the attitude of the cuban government has been to meddle directly in internal affairs that are the exclusive domain " of the mexican government .
crackdown on dissidents in his speech to a million-strong rally in havana , president castro lashed out at states which had voted against cuba 's human rights record at the un human rights commission in geneva in april .
he dismissed all the relevant latin american governments as weaklings , unable to make their own decisions on foreign policy .
he accused them of taking direct instructions from the us .
mexico 's international reputation in particular , he said , had " turned to ashes " .
the un resolution , backed by the us , called on cuba to " refrain from adopting measures which could jeopardise the fundamental rights , the freedom of expression and the right to due process of its citizens " .
new concern over cuba 's treatment of political dissidents surfaced last week when it jailed juan carlos gonzalez leiva , a blind lawyer , for four years for contempt , public disorder and resisting arrest .

along with judges , politicians , vicars , doctors and midwives , police have had their exemption from juries removed under last year 's criminal justice act .
ministers hope the change will increase jury representation from these groups .
but the met police federation , which represents rank-and-file officers in the capital , says it is unworkable .
the idea of having policemen on jury service for long periods will detract from the protection of the public david davis shadow home secretary glen smyth , chairman of the federation , said : " i 'm sure defence lawyers will want to know if jurors have connections with the police service and will object to them if they do . "
he said there was an added problem that police officers could know defendants in the case .
the changes to the act , which cover police in england and wales , came into force on 5 april .
but mr smyth said his organisation only found out about them last month when an officer received a call to attend court and was unable to secure an exemption , he said .
his concerns were echoed by shadow home secretary david davis , who told the sun : " we do not have enough police on the streets as it stands .
" the idea of having policemen on jury service for long periods will detract from the protection of the public . "
' dodging ' the old system was criticised for being too easy for some professions to seek exemptions , leaving juries heavily reliant on people not working .
in 2001 , mr blunkett said : " anyone who shirks the responsibility of jury duty helps to undermine the foundation of one of our country 's most cherished freedoms . "
a spokesman for the department for constitutional affairs said only 200,000 of the 480,000 people called up for jury duty each year were eligible to serve under the old rules .
" jury service is an extremely important civic duty .
for too long a large number of people have been excused from serving on a jury because of their profession or position in society . "
under the new rules , being excused from jury duty requires " exceptional circumstances " and service is deferred to a more convenient time .

populations have been declining over the past 50 years , due to the loss of flower-rich habitats .
several scottish species are now deemed vulnerable , including the bilberry bumblebee , the moss carder bee and the great yellow bumblebee .
scottish natural heritage has produced a guidebook offering advice on how to be more bumblebee-friendly .
the publication says farmers , crofters , foresters and gardeners can all help by leaving areas of wildflowers , particularly thistles , foxgloves , brambles and wild raspberry . "
the bumblebee is important for our ecosystem and i hope this encourages people to take action to prevent its habitat loss and continued decline " dr murdo macdonald it also says a more wildlife-friendly approach to cutting roadside verges and other public green spaces would help to reverse the decline .
murdo macdonald , biologist and author of the bumblebees publication , said : " bumblebees are probably the best-loved insects after butterflies , and to the naturalist they are of crucial importance as pollinators of wild flowers and , because they depend on the presence of an abundant and diverse flora , they are useful indicators of the health of the environment . "
the moss carder bee has declined uk-wide , and is now found mostly in shetland , orkney , the western isles and the inner hebrides .
experts are so concerned that it has been placed on the species recovery program by english nature .
populations of the great yellow bumblebee have also fallen significantly , resulting in the species becoming confined to orkney , the western isles , inner hebrides and the north of scotland .
dr macdonald said he hoped the book would encourage people to act .

we have had tears and turmoil .
comic asides and tense drama .

welcome to the fraser inquiry .
first , a confession .

and it 's back !
this week the fraser inquiry is back .
only for a couple of days , admittedly .
on thursday , we will hear from dr john gibbons , the scottish executive 's chief architect .
ill-health caused him to cancel a previous scheduled appearance .
on friday , we will hear from david lewis of structural engineers ove arup .
then , towards the end of the month , we will have closing speeches from the inquiry 's counsel , john campbell qc , and perhaps from advocates representing other parties .
taking shape then the tortuous task for lord fraser and his team of making sense of the information given to them : the witnesses , the thousands of documents .
meanwhile , down at the foot of the royal mile , a parliament building is taking shape .
stunning , impressive , aesthetic .
costly , controversial , late .
you choose .
lord fraser , of course , can not choose .
his remit is precise : to examine and report upon the decisions which led the building to be just so late and just so costly , some £ 431m .
it is possible - from following the evidence - to discern some likely areas of concern he has to deal exclusively with the dark side .
which is , i think , something of a problem .
he has to report objectively on choices which are , to a large extent and by definition , subjective .
should holyrood have been chosen as the site for the new parliament building ?
well , yes , if you like that choice .
no , if you - subjectively - would have preferred calton hill .
incidentally , i do not expect lord fraser to endorse donald gorrie 's assertion that only a glaswegian -lrb- one d dewar -rrb- would have picked holyrood .
then , was enric miralles the right person to select as the designer ?
yes , if you think he was an artistic genius .
no , if you do not like his style - or think he did not pay enough attention to cost .
areas of concern however , there are plenty of other issues for lord fraser to tackle without stating his preference on such subjective matters .
of course , that lies in his hands too .
but it is possible - from following the evidence - to discern some likely areas of concern .
firstly , the early estimate in the scottish office white paper on devolution that a parliament building - any parliament building - might be constructed for between £ 10m and £ 40m .
the holyrood project is over budget that was not a costing for holyrood , but i would not be surprised to find lord fraser arguing that the estimate was ludicrous - and has posed problems since .
then the choice of holyrood .
the site itself is a subjective matter , but might lord fraser question the relative haste with which holyrood was assessed - after it emerged as a contender following a brief encounter on a train between a surveyor and civil servants ?
i think it likely .
what about the choice of enric miralles ?
i think lord fraser might have a word or two to write about the absence of any searching examination of cost issues in choosing the catalan architect .
remember hugh fisher from the cost consultants dle .
asked if enric miralles paid much attention to matters of cost , he replied with a single word : " scant " .
of the thousands of words delivered to the inquiry , this one contribution might prove influential .
' seriously damaging ' and what about the choice of bovis as construction managers ?
why were they reinstated to a shortlist when they had earlier been excluded on grounds of cost ?
expect lord fraser to comment on that .
what about tales of tension between the barcelona and edinburgh wings of the design team , between enric miralles and rmjm ?
those involved - including the architect 's widow benedetta tagliabuie - play this down .
everyone else thinks it was serious - and seriously damaging .
expect lord fraser to endorse the latter verdict .
it is possible , now , to see a way forward , an escape from the toxic impact of this building project upon the scottish body politic then the changes made by sir david steel and msps after they took control from the scottish office .
perhaps they were reasonable , given that the msps wanted to have their say and that more detail had emerged about the actual working practices and requirements of the parliament .
but they were costly as they delayed construction .
expect comment on that .
then the management of the system : the changes in personnel , the uncertainty , the " multi-headed client " bemoaned by brian stewart of rmjm , the holyrood progress group on a steep learning curve .
lord fraser is certain to remark on that element .

prime mover the very fact of the fraser inquiry , the scrutiny to which they have been relentlessly subjected , has proven to be tough .
the report itself may not prove universally comfortable reading either .
and the man who can not be there , who can not answer for himself .
donald dewar , the architect of devolution - and the prime mover behind holyrood in the earliest days .
he wanted , apparently , to " endow " scotland with a signature building .
but will it end up scarring his own legacy ?
lord fraser is conducting the inquiry yes , perhaps , although i suspect lord fraser will focus more upon the problems which emerged as the project developed .
arguably , donald dewar 's contribution fell more into the subjective zone - the choice of site , the choice of architect .
but has fraser all been worthwhile ?
will the inquiry succeed in getting at the truth ?
for myself , i think it has already worked .
it has proved cathartic in tackling in great detail the concerns which have been voiced , imprecisely , by scotland 's people .
it is possible , now , to see a way forward , an escape from the toxic impact of this building project upon the scottish body politic .
intermingled problems lord fraser reports .
we all have our say .
the building is finally finished .
the msps take occupation .
the queen performs the formal opening ceremony .
then , perhaps , our politicians begin to live up to their new surroundings .
finally , who will take the blame for holyrood ?
i frankly do not believe that lord fraser will be able - or will wish - to lay culpability at a single door .
those of us who have followed every step of the inquiry know that holyrood is a bewildering blend of intermingled problems .
perhaps we should heed the opinion voiced by one witness , john home robertson msp - that the archangel gabriel could not have sorted out holyrood .

arguably , donald dewar 's contribution fell more into the subjective zone - the choice of site , the choice of architect .
but has fraser all been worthwhile ?
will the inquiry succeed in getting at the truth ?
for myself , i think it has already worked .
it has proved cathartic in tackling in great detail the concerns which have been voiced , imprecisely , by scotland 's people .
it is possible , now , to see a way forward , an escape from the toxic impact of this building project upon the scottish body politic .
intermingled problems lord fraser reports .
we all have our say .
the building is finally finished .
the msps take occupation .
the queen performs the formal opening ceremony .
then , perhaps , our politicians begin to live up to their new surroundings .
finally , who will take the blame for holyrood ?
i frankly do not believe that lord fraser will be able - or will wish - to lay culpability at a single door .
those of us who have followed every step of the inquiry know that holyrood is a bewildering blend of intermingled problems .
perhaps we should heed the opinion voiced by one witness , john home robertson msp - that the archangel gabriel could not have sorted out holyrood .

mr buffett , worth some $ 40bn , said he disagreed profoundly with mr bush 's tax cuts for rich people like him .
" he -lrb- bush -rrb- just has a different political philosophy than i do , " mr buffett told the bbc .
mr buffett is pragmatic and endorses individuals and policies rather than parties .
" the sage of omaha " , as mr buffett is sometimes known , advised arnold schwarzenegger when he won in california as a republican .
not ' a good idea ' " in tax , policies have been tilted very much towards the rich , and i think that when the tax cuts took place they should have been far more for the middle class and people in poor economic status , " mr buffett said .
buffett 's backing is welcome news for kerry " instead , i got ... more money in my pocket because of the tax change and i do n't think it 's a good idea , " he added .
mr buffett is perhaps the most powerful business leader in the world .
his company berkshire hathaway owns swathes of corporate america from some of coca-cola to the country 's biggest brickmaker .
mr buffett usually backs winners , at least in business , though that does not necessarily mean senator kerry will win in november 's presidential poll .

the move comes a year after the scottish executive conceded tolls were discredited and began moves to buy out the consortium which owns the bridge .
the bridge , opened eight years ago , was privately built by a commercial group led by the bank of america .
the bridge company is recouping its £ 23m investment by charging the highest bridge tolls per mile in europe .
lucrative contract the skye bridge has been the subject of controversy since it opened in october 1995 .
more than £ 27m has been collected from drivers and protesters argue that the bridge has paid for itself many times over .
after last year 's scottish parliament elections the labour / liberal democrat coalition launched a review , with the aim of negotiating a buy-out of that lucrative contract .
last october , in a letter to the highland msp john farquhar munro , the transport minister nicol stephen confirmed that independent consultants were to meet management from the skye bridge company .
mr farquhar munro said at the time that he was hopeful a solution would be found by christmas .
i would have thought we must be nearing the end of the negotiations and hopefully a decision arrived at in the not too distant future .
john farquhar munro highland msp he now says that he is " disappointed " by the speed of progress .
" i imagined that christmas was sufficient time to hold the negotiations , " he said .
" however , that has not been the case and i accept that these negotiations can be rather cumbersome and protracted .
" but i would have thought we must be nearing the end of the negotiations and hopefully a decision arrived at in the not too distant future . "
the scottish executive said the negotiations were at an advanced stage and a ministerial statement would be made in due course .
in the meantime , opponents of the tolls , who fought a vigorous campaign for years , are going back to the barricades .
andy anderson was the first man to be jailed for refusing to pay the tolls and he is once again staging protests over the charge .
he said he was prepared to go back to jail if that is what it takes .
" if they were foolish enough to do that to me again , i am stupid enough to accept it , " he said .

a big game of hide-and-seek .
it 's the most hi-tech game of hide and seek you ever did see .
it is called uncle roy all around you and is the invention of the blast theory group of artists .
led by matt adams , ju row farr and nick tandavanitj , the group specialises in exploring interactivity and relationships between cyberspace and city space , the virtual and the actual .
participants in a round of uncle roy , which lasts up to an hour , play in the real world and online .
the first uncle roy games were staged in 2003 , but it is back this year and is currently being played in manchester .
the current round runs from 18 april to 8 may and is played between 3 and 9 pm every day .
start here manchester 's cornerhouse is the starting points for the game which can have up to 12 street players and many more online players at any one time .
street players are equipped with pdas to help them look for uncle roy , who regularly supplies them with clues about his whereabouts as well as a lot of other messages .
catherine williams , development officer for blast theory , says the clues can be poetry , lyrical descriptions of parts of the city , historical information or just blunt facts .
is that uncle roy ?
even those who think they know part of a city well can be surprised by what uncle roy reveals to them about the play area .
" all the reference points that come through to look out for are things you would not notice walking through that part of the city , " says ms williams .
changing the way that people think about a city - which for most people is just a backdrop for their life - is one of the professed aims of uncle roy .
instead of a blank cityscape , players have to interact and engage with it , asking people they have never met if they are uncle roy .
instead of a city full of strangers , people become potential helpers and friends .
and it does not stop there .
online chat the locations of street players are mapped on to the virtual manchester that online players navigate around .
is that uncle roy ?
the computer players have to guide the real world players to several destinations to retrieve objects for them .
online players can send text messages to street players and those on the ground can record voice messages for those in cyberspace .
everyone that plays uncle roy enjoys it , said ms williams , but what they get out of it varies enormously .
" it can be a very powerful or a very profound experience , " she said .
the interactive work is a collaboration between blast theory , the mixed reality lab of the university of nottingham and it also has technical support from bt exact .
early versions used gps satellite information to plot positions but now this has been changed to use gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- to make it faster and more accurate .
uncle roy is the creator of the game and he 's set up the entire experience so that people can explore the city and try to track him down through the streets .

changing the way that people think about a city - which for most people is just a backdrop for their life - is one of the professed aims of uncle roy .
instead of a blank cityscape , players have to interact and engage with it , asking people they have never met if they are uncle roy .

the industry trade body had expected to see an increase of 6.9 % .

the biggest quarterly gain was reported by middle east-based airlines , which were most affected by last year 's invasion of iraq .
collectively they saw a 40.2 % rise in passengers , and a 26.3 % surge in cargo .
iata director general giovanni bisignani said the airline industry must continue to work hard to improve financial performance .
" together we must drive the changes needed to ensure sustainable profitability , " he said .
speaking to the global travel and tourism summit in qatar he also called for the air transport and tourism industries to work closer together .
" together we must ensure that our monopoly infrastructure providers share our drive for cost reduction and efficiency and that governments understand the need for greater liberalisation . "

air traffic climbed by 10 % in the first quarter of 2004 , compared with the same period in 2003 , the international air transport association has said .
the industry trade body had expected to see an increase of 6.9 % .
for the first three months of 2004 , passenger numbers were up 9.6 % , while freight increased by 10.1 % .
the march-on-march increase was even stronger for passenger levels , which grew by 13.3 % .
industry efforts freight levels for march were however less impressive than the first quarter as a whole , increasing by 8 % .
the biggest quarterly gain was reported by middle east-based airlines , which were most affected by last year 's invasion of iraq .
collectively they saw a 40.2 % rise in passengers , and a 26.3 % surge in cargo .
iata director general giovanni bisignani said the airline industry must continue to work hard to improve financial performance .
" together we must drive the changes needed to ensure sustainable profitability , " he said .
speaking to the global travel and tourism summit in qatar he also called for the air transport and tourism industries to work closer together .
" together we must ensure that our monopoly infrastructure providers share our drive for cost reduction and efficiency and that governments understand the need for greater liberalisation . "
iata represents 270 airlines , which provide 98 % of international scheduled air travel .
