the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .

but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

the company intends to use the funds to drive its restructuring process .
the next step is a capital increase , due to be decided on monday . " the banks have signed the deal , " said karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe on friday . previously , the company only had guaranteed financing through the bayern lb and abn amro-led consortium until the end of this year . reservations overcome within the consortium , there were initially reservations about the deal , voiced mainly by the norddeutsche landesbank and the landesbank baden-württemberg .
they were later brought back on board by the other consortium members . the agreement on a credit line for karstadtquelle is of enormous significance to the company 's future development .
company shareholders are meeting in an extraordinary general meeting in düsseldorf on monday to decide on a € 500 million capital increase - also necessary for the company 's restructuring . industry insiders report that karstadtquelle is also negotiating with further possible money lenders such as goldman sachs , to secure extra elbowroom for the company 's financial future . right road to recovery karstadtquelle 's restructuring plans have already been given the blessing of consultancy firm roland berger , which has said the company is " on the right path . " a further step will involve the naming of a chief restructuring officer , who will be tasked with implementing karstadtquelle 's recovery plan .
among other measures , the plan foresees the sale of 77 of the company 's 181 department stores and all of its specialty stores . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reached at karstadtquelle management and unions at karstadtquelle finally reached agreement thursday on a package of measures aimed at pulling the troubled german department store chain out of its current crisis , company officials said .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

" one race wants to dominate the other race , " ruun said .

" it 's a brutal development , as -lrb- european central bank chief -rrb- jean-claude trichet has said , " eichel said in an interview with german ard television .
" it will have to be talked about .
but , as befits currency issues , such discussions should take place behind closed doors and hopefully japan , the us and europe will be able to find a common position . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel 's comments , coming just a day before finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world 's 20 most powerful nations gather in berlin , are the clearest sign yet of germany 's concern . the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- comprises the world 's seven richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy japan and the us - as well as 13 others , china , india , russia , argentina , australia , brazil , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey and the eu . the g20 group accounts for 90 percent of the world 's total economy and around 80 percent of its trade .
it also comprises roughly two-thirds of the planet 's population .
the summit will cover wide-ranging topics from international tax evasion , money laundering and high oil prices . the meeting is scheduled to begin with a dinner on friday evening , followed by two days of talks on saturday and sunday .
officially , the fall of the dollar and of asian currencies pegged to it - such as the chinese yuan - is not on the agenda of the g20 talks .
but the issue is nevertheless likely to dominate discussions over the weekend . eu and japan worried europe and japan appear to be on the same wavelength .
the head of the bank of japan , toshihiko fukui , estimated thursday that " developments on the foreign exchange and financial markets could create uncertainty for the japanese economy .
we will monitor closely these developments and their consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow the day before , japanese finance minister sadakazu tanigaki had said that very big movements in the dollar-yen exchange rate could trigger a reaction from the government .
but us treasury secretary john snow , currently touring europe , has indicated that the us is not prepared to participate in concerted intervention and told european governments to undertake structural reforms to help boost growth . that line does n't go down well in some capitals in europe , where some see the united states reaping the economic benefits of a weak dollar at the expense of those countries suffering under the strong euro .
some eu officials have been critical of the united states for its massive budget and balance of payments deficits , but snow argues that most of europe is suffering from a " growth deficit , " and that the us deficits will come down when the rest of the world picks up the pace of economic growth . germany , with its export-driven economy , is particularly sensitive to the damage that could be wrought should the dollar continue to slide .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .

erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .

initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .

" when east germany collapsed , the basic principles no longer applied . "
" after 1990 , some 42,000 namibians returned from exile , " he said , pointing out that with the south african government 's military occupation finally banished , " people were coming back from the countries to which they 'd fled , such as cuba , zambia and angola , and that caused all sorts of crises , such as housing problems .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .
unfinished business lucia was to stay 11 years .
had the berlin wall not fallen , she would have graduated from high school and maybe even stayed in east germany to pursue further studies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia 's outgoing president sam nujoma but at least the demise of the eastern bloc coincided with namibia gaining independence .
in 1990 , swapo became the country 's dominant political party , with its head , sam nujoma -lrb- pictured -rrb- , elected as the first president .
" i would have liked to stay in germany to finish my studies , " said lucia engombe , who was 17 at the time .
" but i wanted to go to namibia , because it meant that finally , i had a home .
i had never had one before .
i had been a refugee , which had been unbearable .
suddenly i belonged to a free country called namibia , and i was going to see my family again . "
amid the turbulence of reunification , little thought was paid to the young exiles .
the interim east german government led by lothar de maiziere was too busy to arrange residence permits and wasted no time sending them home .
but namibia 's new-found independence had created its own confusion , and the country 's supposed young elite were left to fend for themselves .
" educating namibian children had been seen as an investment for both countries , " lucia 's co-author , peter hilliges , told dw-world .
" when east germany collapsed , the basic principles no longer applied . "
" after 1990 , some 42,000 namibians returned from exile , " he said , pointing out that with the south african government 's military occupation finally banished , " people were coming back from the countries to which they 'd fled , such as cuba , zambia and angola , and that caused all sorts of crises , such as housing problems . "
culture shock " the problems of what were dubbed the ' ddr -lrb- gdr -rrb- children ' were relatively minor , " hilliges said .
" they were simply swallowed up in the hordes of returning refugees .
given that they 'd had a good education , they were expected to fare well . "
it was n't that easy .
" these children were stranded between cultures , " hilliges added .
" first and foremost , they had basic linguistic problems . "

many were taken under the wing of members of namibia 's german community , who helped them secure grants from the german government and aid institutions to complete their education at windhoek 's german high schools , previously only attended by whites .
the self-proclaimed " ossi " africans - referring to the nickname for eastern germans - have experienced mixed fates .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .
unfinished business lucia was to stay 11 years .
had the berlin wall not fallen , she would have graduated from high school and maybe even stayed in east germany to pursue further studies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia 's outgoing president sam nujoma but at least the demise of the eastern bloc coincided with namibia gaining independence .
in 1990 , swapo became the country 's dominant political party , with its head , sam nujoma -lrb- pictured -rrb- , elected as the first president .
" i would have liked to stay in germany to finish my studies , " said lucia engombe , who was 17 at the time .
" but i wanted to go to namibia , because it meant that finally , i had a home .
i had never had one before .
i had been a refugee , which had been unbearable .
suddenly i belonged to a free country called namibia , and i was going to see my family again . "
amid the turbulence of reunification , little thought was paid to the young exiles .
the interim east german government led by lothar de maiziere was too busy to arrange residence permits and wasted no time sending them home .
but namibia 's new-found independence had created its own confusion , and the country 's supposed young elite were left to fend for themselves .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.11.2004 the battle for munich 's skyline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is best defined by its church towers , some residents say munich 's architectural visionaries dream of a skyline dotted with tall towers , but opponents argue that skyscrapers do n't belong in the bavarian capital .
this weekend , city officials are putting the matter to the people . with the alps within easy driving distance , munich has one of the most dramatic backdrops nature could offer .
the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .
now it 's up to munich residents to decide which camp has the better arguments .
on sunday , all inhabitants will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum , regardless of their nationality . a sampling of opinion in munich 's newspapers found equally strong voices for both sides . " we do n't need these modern glass towers in munich , " one man told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" some might say that 's rather provincial , but that 's munich . " like it or leave it other residents say the image of munich as a sleepy bavarian town is passé . " we do n't live in a village , " one woman complained to the münchner merkur .
" people who want to live without high-rise buildings should just move to the countryside . " but unless voters pay careful attention on sunday , the vote may not reflect the true strength of feeling on either side .
that 's because the way the referendum question has been phrased , those against more tall buildings actually need to tick " yes , " while those in favor need to tick " no .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

but us treasury secretary john snow , currently touring europe , has indicated that the us is not prepared to participate in concerted intervention and told european governments to undertake structural reforms to help boost growth . that line does n't go down well in some capitals in europe , where some see the united states reaping the economic benefits of a weak dollar at the expense of those countries suffering under the strong euro .
some eu officials have been critical of the united states for its massive budget and balance of payments deficits , but snow argues that most of europe is suffering from a " growth deficit , " and that the us deficits will come down when the rest of the world picks up the pace of economic growth . germany , with its export-driven economy , is particularly sensitive to the damage that could be wrought should the dollar continue to slide .
however , eichel is unlikely to be able to convince snow of the need to have concerted central bank action in the foreign exchange markets .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.11.2004 east germany 's namibian adventure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone for 11 years , engombe found it hard to readjust to namibia when the berlin wall fell , a community of namibian children educated in the former east germany found themselves in the grips of a lasting identity crisis .
one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .
unfinished business lucia was to stay 11 years .
had the berlin wall not fallen , she would have graduated from high school and maybe even stayed in east germany to pursue further studies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia 's outgoing president sam nujoma but at least the demise of the eastern bloc coincided with namibia gaining independence .
in 1990 , swapo became the country 's dominant political party , with its head , sam nujoma -lrb- pictured -rrb- , elected as the first president .
" i would have liked to stay in germany to finish my studies , " said lucia engombe , who was 17 at the time .
" but i wanted to go to namibia , because it meant that finally , i had a home .
i had never had one before .
i had been a refugee , which had been unbearable .
suddenly i belonged to a free country called namibia , and i was going to see my family again . "
amid the turbulence of reunification , little thought was paid to the young exiles .
the interim east german government led by lothar de maiziere was too busy to arrange residence permits and wasted no time sending them home .
but namibia 's new-found independence had created its own confusion , and the country 's supposed young elite were left to fend for themselves .
" educating namibian children had been seen as an investment for both countries , " lucia 's co-author , peter hilliges , told dw-world .
" when east germany collapsed , the basic principles no longer applied . "
" after 1990 , some 42,000 namibians returned from exile , " he said , pointing out that with the south african government 's military occupation finally banished , " people were coming back from the countries to which they 'd fled , such as cuba , zambia and angola , and that caused all sorts of crises , such as housing problems . "
culture shock " the problems of what were dubbed the ' ddr -lrb- gdr -rrb- children ' were relatively minor , " hilliges said .
" they were simply swallowed up in the hordes of returning refugees .
given that they 'd had a good education , they were expected to fare well . "
it was n't that easy .
" these children were stranded between cultures , " hilliges added .
" first and foremost , they had basic linguistic problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence avenue in windhoek the young people stuck together , speaking their made-up brand of german and oshiwambo , and clinging to their peculiar identity in the face of broad resentment of what many namibians saw as arrogance .
many were taken under the wing of members of namibia 's german community , who helped them secure grants from the german government and aid institutions to complete their education at windhoek 's german high schools , previously only attended by whites .
the self-proclaimed " ossi " africans - referring to the nickname for eastern germans - have experienced mixed fates .
some are now working as lawyers and businessmen , while lucia herself is training as a journalist .
some , though , were less fortunate .
and few returned to live in germany . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undoing germany 's colonial amnesia germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

on friday , sudan 's government and southern rebels agreed to reach a peace deal by the end of the year . the signing of the resolution to end 21 years of civil war in sudan took place at a special session of the united nations security council in the kenyan capital , nairobi .
sudan 's government and its southern rebel foes promised to end africa 's longest running civil war by dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extraordinary session of the un security council took place in nairobi this week .
just ahead of the signing , the german government said it would pledge around 200 soldiers plus air transport capabilities to the african union 's mission in charge of monitoring peace efforts in sudan . government spokesman bela anda said african union troops from nigeria , rwanda , the gambia and tanzania are to be given logistical support for their deployment in the crisis region of darfur . " the aim of the mission is to contribute to a stabilization of the region by supporting relief efforts and by helping protect the population there , " he said .
" germany 's armed forces will support the deployment of peacekeeping troops by providing military transport capabilities . " humanitarian crisis rebels in sudan 's south have been fighting the government in khartoum since 1983 , when khartoum tried to impose islamic law on the entire country .
a separate rebel conflict erupted in the darfur region nearly two years ago , spawning what the un has called the world 's worst humanitarian crisis . haruun ruun , secretary general of the southern-based new sudan council of churches , said there is a genocide going on in darfur , mainly by government-mobilized arab " self-defense militias , " which are accused of carrying out atrocities against local black africans . " one race wants to dominate the other race , " ruun said .
" one race wants to use the other race as labor without giving them their rights .
so we want the international community to really support the african union to make sure that the african union forces are able to respond to the situation and not just watch people being killed . " opposition support germany ’ s opposition conservatives and liberals said they are willing to support the government ’ s decision to send troops in a parliamentary vote scheduled for the end of november . at the same time , however , they claimed that the troop shipments for the african union would bring the bundeswehr to its limits as up to 8,000 troops are already assigned to missions abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.11.2004 eu still derailed over train harmony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the right track ?
rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

this weekend , city officials are putting the matter to the people . with the alps within easy driving distance , munich has one of the most dramatic backdrops nature could offer .
the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .
unfinished business lucia was to stay 11 years .

" i would have liked to stay in germany to finish my studies , " said lucia engombe , who was 17 at the time .
" but i wanted to go to namibia , because it meant that finally , i had a home .
i had never had one before .
i had been a refugee , which had been unbearable .
suddenly i belonged to a free country called namibia , and i was going to see my family again . "
amid the turbulence of reunification , little thought was paid to the young exiles .
the interim east german government led by lothar de maiziere was too busy to arrange residence permits and wasted no time sending them home .
but namibia 's new-found independence had created its own confusion , and the country 's supposed young elite were left to fend for themselves .
" educating namibian children had been seen as an investment for both countries , " lucia 's co-author , peter hilliges , told dw-world .
" when east germany collapsed , the basic principles no longer applied . "
" after 1990 , some 42,000 namibians returned from exile , " he said , pointing out that with the south african government 's military occupation finally banished , " people were coming back from the countries to which they 'd fled , such as cuba , zambia and angola , and that caused all sorts of crises , such as housing problems . "

" they were simply swallowed up in the hordes of returning refugees .

it was n't that easy .
" these children were stranded between cultures , " hilliges added .

this weekend , city officials are putting the matter to the people . with the alps within easy driving distance , munich has one of the most dramatic backdrops nature could offer .
the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .
now it 's up to munich residents to decide which camp has the better arguments .
on sunday , all inhabitants will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum , regardless of their nationality . a sampling of opinion in munich 's newspapers found equally strong voices for both sides . " we do n't need these modern glass towers in munich , " one man told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" some might say that 's rather provincial , but that 's munich . " like it or leave it other residents say the image of munich as a sleepy bavarian town is passé . " we do n't live in a village , " one woman complained to the münchner merkur .
" people who want to live without high-rise buildings should just move to the countryside . " but unless voters pay careful attention on sunday , the vote may not reflect the true strength of feeling on either side .
that 's because the way the referendum question has been phrased , those against more tall buildings actually need to tick " yes , " while those in favor need to tick " no .

" it 's a brutal development , as -lrb- european central bank chief -rrb- jean-claude trichet has said , " eichel said in an interview with german ard television .
" it will have to be talked about .
but , as befits currency issues , such discussions should take place behind closed doors and hopefully japan , the us and europe will be able to find a common position . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel 's comments , coming just a day before finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world 's 20 most powerful nations gather in berlin , are the clearest sign yet of germany 's concern . the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- comprises the world 's seven richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy japan and the us - as well as 13 others , china , india , russia , argentina , australia , brazil , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey and the eu . the g20 group accounts for 90 percent of the world 's total economy and around 80 percent of its trade .
it also comprises roughly two-thirds of the planet 's population .
the summit will cover wide-ranging topics from international tax evasion , money laundering and high oil prices . the meeting is scheduled to begin with a dinner on friday evening , followed by two days of talks on saturday and sunday .
officially , the fall of the dollar and of asian currencies pegged to it - such as the chinese yuan - is not on the agenda of the g20 talks .
but the issue is nevertheless likely to dominate discussions over the weekend . eu and japan worried europe and japan appear to be on the same wavelength .
the head of the bank of japan , toshihiko fukui , estimated thursday that " developments on the foreign exchange and financial markets could create uncertainty for the japanese economy .
we will monitor closely these developments and their consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow the day before , japanese finance minister sadakazu tanigaki had said that very big movements in the dollar-yen exchange rate could trigger a reaction from the government .
but us treasury secretary john snow , currently touring europe , has indicated that the us is not prepared to participate in concerted intervention and told european governments to undertake structural reforms to help boost growth . that line does n't go down well in some capitals in europe , where some see the united states reaping the economic benefits of a weak dollar at the expense of those countries suffering under the strong euro .
some eu officials have been critical of the united states for its massive budget and balance of payments deficits , but snow argues that most of europe is suffering from a " growth deficit , " and that the us deficits will come down when the rest of the world picks up the pace of economic growth . germany , with its export-driven economy , is particularly sensitive to the damage that could be wrought should the dollar continue to slide .
however , eichel is unlikely to be able to convince snow of the need to have concerted central bank action in the foreign exchange markets . " everybody knows what our position is - a strong dollar , -lrb- and -rrb- currency values set in open markets , " snow said during a visit to poland before heading to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel 's comments , coming just a day before finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world 's 20 most powerful nations gather in berlin , are the clearest sign yet of germany 's concern . the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- comprises the world 's seven richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy japan and the us - as well as 13 others , china , india , russia , argentina , australia , brazil , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey and the eu . the g20 group accounts for 90 percent of the world 's total economy and around 80 percent of its trade .
it also comprises roughly two-thirds of the planet 's population .
the summit will cover wide-ranging topics from international tax evasion , money laundering and high oil prices . the meeting is scheduled to begin with a dinner on friday evening , followed by two days of talks on saturday and sunday .
officially , the fall of the dollar and of asian currencies pegged to it - such as the chinese yuan - is not on the agenda of the g20 talks .

but us treasury secretary john snow , currently touring europe , has indicated that the us is not prepared to participate in concerted intervention and told european governments to undertake structural reforms to help boost growth . that line does n't go down well in some capitals in europe , where some see the united states reaping the economic benefits of a weak dollar at the expense of those countries suffering under the strong euro .
some eu officials have been critical of the united states for its massive budget and balance of payments deficits , but snow argues that most of europe is suffering from a " growth deficit , " and that the us deficits will come down when the rest of the world picks up the pace of economic growth . germany , with its export-driven economy , is particularly sensitive to the damage that could be wrought should the dollar continue to slide .
however , eichel is unlikely to be able to convince snow of the need to have concerted central bank action in the foreign exchange markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

company shareholders are meeting in an extraordinary general meeting in düsseldorf on monday to decide on a € 500 million capital increase - also necessary for the company 's restructuring . industry insiders report that karstadtquelle is also negotiating with further possible money lenders such as goldman sachs , to secure extra elbowroom for the company 's financial future . right road to recovery karstadtquelle 's restructuring plans have already been given the blessing of consultancy firm roland berger , which has said the company is " on the right path . " a further step will involve the naming of a chief restructuring officer , who will be tasked with implementing karstadtquelle 's recovery plan .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .

" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 opinion : time to get to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a rough ride for incoming commission president jose barroso the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .
the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.11.2004 eu still derailed over train harmony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the right track ?
rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

one woman has now published a book about her experience . in autumn 1989 , as germany rejoiced at the end of the country 's 40-year division , many of the students at the " high-school of friendship " in stassfurt , near magdeburg , felt their hearts sink .
for over 400 children and teenagers dispatched to east germany from namibia over the previous decade , the collapse of communism meant one thing : an uncertain future in a country they could barely remember .
lucia engombe was one of them .
" namibia was a strange place to me - all i knew about it was what my teachers had told me , " she told dw-world .
training the future elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swapo election campaign poster germany 's relationship with the southwestern african country began in the late 19th century , when bismarck claimed it as a colony . almost one hundred years later , communist east germany was backing the south west africa people 's organization -lrb- swapo -rrb- in its fight against south african rule and apartheid .
erich honecker 's government earmarked what it called " solidarity funds " to support the marxist movement with aid and military supplies , and also hatched a plan intended to be of political and military benefit to both countries .
but 1990 marked an abrupt end to the party-led project to take in and educate namibian children , with the ultimate aim of creating an elite class to lead the swapo liberation movement .
child no. 95 with " child no.95 - my german-african odyssey , " a biography recently published in germany , lucia engombe has written an account of a little-known slice of east germany history - both a historical document and a personal memoir .
plucked at the age of seven from a refugee camp in nyango , zambia , she and some 80 other children were sent to bellin , mecklenburg , in deepest east germany .
to a small child who 'd suffered such hunger pangs she would swallow buttons she found on the ground , east germany was the land of plenty - a place where even the notoriously gritty toothpaste tasted delicious .
initially isolated from the outside world , the children were taught by a team of party-faithful teachers recruited from both germany and namibia .
the curriculum included military drills and weapons deployment , while verbal and physical abuse as well as inevitable ideological indoctrination were par for the course .
unfinished business lucia was to stay 11 years .
had the berlin wall not fallen , she would have graduated from high school and maybe even stayed in east germany to pursue further studies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia 's outgoing president sam nujoma but at least the demise of the eastern bloc coincided with namibia gaining independence .
in 1990 , swapo became the country 's dominant political party , with its head , sam nujoma -lrb- pictured -rrb- , elected as the first president .
" i would have liked to stay in germany to finish my studies , " said lucia engombe , who was 17 at the time .
" but i wanted to go to namibia , because it meant that finally , i had a home .
i had never had one before .
i had been a refugee , which had been unbearable .
suddenly i belonged to a free country called namibia , and i was going to see my family again . "
amid the turbulence of reunification , little thought was paid to the young exiles .
the interim east german government led by lothar de maiziere was too busy to arrange residence permits and wasted no time sending them home .
but namibia 's new-found independence had created its own confusion , and the country 's supposed young elite were left to fend for themselves .
" educating namibian children had been seen as an investment for both countries , " lucia 's co-author , peter hilliges , told dw-world .
" when east germany collapsed , the basic principles no longer applied . "
" after 1990 , some 42,000 namibians returned from exile , " he said , pointing out that with the south african government 's military occupation finally banished , " people were coming back from the countries to which they 'd fled , such as cuba , zambia and angola , and that caused all sorts of crises , such as housing problems . "
culture shock " the problems of what were dubbed the ' ddr -lrb- gdr -rrb- children ' were relatively minor , " hilliges said .
" they were simply swallowed up in the hordes of returning refugees .
given that they 'd had a good education , they were expected to fare well . "
it was n't that easy .
" these children were stranded between cultures , " hilliges added .
" first and foremost , they had basic linguistic problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence avenue in windhoek the young people stuck together , speaking their made-up brand of german and oshiwambo , and clinging to their peculiar identity in the face of broad resentment of what many namibians saw as arrogance .
many were taken under the wing of members of namibia 's german community , who helped them secure grants from the german government and aid institutions to complete their education at windhoek 's german high schools , previously only attended by whites .
the self-proclaimed " ossi " africans - referring to the nickname for eastern germans - have experienced mixed fates .

this weekend , city officials are putting the matter to the people . with the alps within easy driving distance , munich has one of the most dramatic backdrops nature could offer .
the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .
now it 's up to munich residents to decide which camp has the better arguments .
on sunday , all inhabitants will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum , regardless of their nationality . a sampling of opinion in munich 's newspapers found equally strong voices for both sides . " we do n't need these modern glass towers in munich , " one man told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" some might say that 's rather provincial , but that 's munich . " like it or leave it other residents say the image of munich as a sleepy bavarian town is passé . " we do n't live in a village , " one woman complained to the münchner merkur .
" people who want to live without high-rise buildings should just move to the countryside . " but unless voters pay careful attention on sunday , the vote may not reflect the true strength of feeling on either side .
that 's because the way the referendum question has been phrased , those against more tall buildings actually need to tick " yes , " while those in favor need to tick " no .

the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .

on friday , sudan 's government and southern rebels agreed to reach a peace deal by the end of the year . the signing of the resolution to end 21 years of civil war in sudan took place at a special session of the united nations security council in the kenyan capital , nairobi .
sudan 's government and its southern rebel foes promised to end africa 's longest running civil war by dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extraordinary session of the un security council took place in nairobi this week .
just ahead of the signing , the german government said it would pledge around 200 soldiers plus air transport capabilities to the african union 's mission in charge of monitoring peace efforts in sudan . government spokesman bela anda said african union troops from nigeria , rwanda , the gambia and tanzania are to be given logistical support for their deployment in the crisis region of darfur . " the aim of the mission is to contribute to a stabilization of the region by supporting relief efforts and by helping protect the population there , " he said .
" germany 's armed forces will support the deployment of peacekeeping troops by providing military transport capabilities . " humanitarian crisis rebels in sudan 's south have been fighting the government in khartoum since 1983 , when khartoum tried to impose islamic law on the entire country .
a separate rebel conflict erupted in the darfur region nearly two years ago , spawning what the un has called the world 's worst humanitarian crisis . haruun ruun , secretary general of the southern-based new sudan council of churches , said there is a genocide going on in darfur , mainly by government-mobilized arab " self-defense militias , " which are accused of carrying out atrocities against local black africans . " one race wants to dominate the other race , " ruun said .
" one race wants to use the other race as labor without giving them their rights .
so we want the international community to really support the african union to make sure that the african union forces are able to respond to the situation and not just watch people being killed . " opposition support germany ’ s opposition conservatives and liberals said they are willing to support the government ’ s decision to send troops in a parliamentary vote scheduled for the end of november . at the same time , however , they claimed that the troop shipments for the african union would bring the bundeswehr to its limits as up to 8,000 troops are already assigned to missions abroad .

this weekend , city officials are putting the matter to the people . with the alps within easy driving distance , munich has one of the most dramatic backdrops nature could offer .
the city 's most famous landmark is currently the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , with its twin towers rising 109 meters -lrb- around 358 feet -rrb- into the sky .
a vocal group of purists led by a former munich mayor would like to keep things that way .
georg kronawitter started an initiative to limit the height of new buildings to 100 meters in response to plans to build three new high-rise buildings in the bavarian capital .
should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .
now it 's up to munich residents to decide which camp has the better arguments .
on sunday , all inhabitants will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum , regardless of their nationality . a sampling of opinion in munich 's newspapers found equally strong voices for both sides . " we do n't need these modern glass towers in munich , " one man told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" some might say that 's rather provincial , but that 's munich . " like it or leave it other residents say the image of munich as a sleepy bavarian town is passé . " we do n't live in a village , " one woman complained to the münchner merkur .
" people who want to live without high-rise buildings should just move to the countryside . " but unless voters pay careful attention on sunday , the vote may not reflect the true strength of feeling on either side .
that 's because the way the referendum question has been phrased , those against more tall buildings actually need to tick " yes , " while those in favor need to tick " no .

should the projects be approved , munich would be in danger of losing its " uniqueness , " kronawitter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is dominated by high-rise office towers members of kronawitter 's camp also object to the possibility of munich becoming a second frankfurt am main , which is often referred to as " mainhattan " because of its new york-style skyline . cramping their style but leading the side in favor of more tall buildings is munich 's current mayor , christian ude .
and he 's got a broad alliance of industry leaders in his corner .
munich needs to keep up with " contemporary architecture , " they argue , adding that high-rise buildings are the best way to create more office and living space without creeping into the green belt on the city 's outskirts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering for a proposed munich office tower for süddeutscher verlag , which publishes süddeutsche zeitung .
now it 's up to munich residents to decide which camp has the better arguments .
on sunday , all inhabitants will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum , regardless of their nationality . a sampling of opinion in munich 's newspapers found equally strong voices for both sides . " we do n't need these modern glass towers in munich , " one man told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" some might say that 's rather provincial , but that 's munich . " like it or leave it other residents say the image of munich as a sleepy bavarian town is passé . " we do n't live in a village , " one woman complained to the münchner merkur .
" people who want to live without high-rise buildings should just move to the countryside . " but unless voters pay careful attention on sunday , the vote may not reflect the true strength of feeling on either side .
that 's because the way the referendum question has been phrased , those against more tall buildings actually need to tick " yes , " while those in favor need to tick " no .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

on friday , sudan 's government and southern rebels agreed to reach a peace deal by the end of the year . the signing of the resolution to end 21 years of civil war in sudan took place at a special session of the united nations security council in the kenyan capital , nairobi .
sudan 's government and its southern rebel foes promised to end africa 's longest running civil war by dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extraordinary session of the un security council took place in nairobi this week .
just ahead of the signing , the german government said it would pledge around 200 soldiers plus air transport capabilities to the african union 's mission in charge of monitoring peace efforts in sudan . government spokesman bela anda said african union troops from nigeria , rwanda , the gambia and tanzania are to be given logistical support for their deployment in the crisis region of darfur . " the aim of the mission is to contribute to a stabilization of the region by supporting relief efforts and by helping protect the population there , " he said .
" germany 's armed forces will support the deployment of peacekeeping troops by providing military transport capabilities . " humanitarian crisis rebels in sudan 's south have been fighting the government in khartoum since 1983 , when khartoum tried to impose islamic law on the entire country .
a separate rebel conflict erupted in the darfur region nearly two years ago , spawning what the un has called the world 's worst humanitarian crisis . haruun ruun , secretary general of the southern-based new sudan council of churches , said there is a genocide going on in darfur , mainly by government-mobilized arab " self-defense militias , " which are accused of carrying out atrocities against local black africans . " one race wants to dominate the other race , " ruun said .
" one race wants to use the other race as labor without giving them their rights .
so we want the international community to really support the african union to make sure that the african union forces are able to respond to the situation and not just watch people being killed . " opposition support germany ’ s opposition conservatives and liberals said they are willing to support the government ’ s decision to send troops in a parliamentary vote scheduled for the end of november . at the same time , however , they claimed that the troop shipments for the african union would bring the bundeswehr to its limits as up to 8,000 troops are already assigned to missions abroad .
any further plans for troop deployment abroad , they said , would be rejected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for un probe of sudan genocide charges on monday , the european union 's foreign ministers urged the united nations to conduct an inquiry into allegations of genocide in sudan , renewing the threat of sanctions for the african country .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .

the company intends to use the funds to drive its restructuring process .
the next step is a capital increase , due to be decided on monday . " the banks have signed the deal , " said karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe on friday . previously , the company only had guaranteed financing through the bayern lb and abn amro-led consortium until the end of this year . reservations overcome within the consortium , there were initially reservations about the deal , voiced mainly by the norddeutsche landesbank and the landesbank baden-württemberg .
they were later brought back on board by the other consortium members . the agreement on a credit line for karstadtquelle is of enormous significance to the company 's future development .
company shareholders are meeting in an extraordinary general meeting in düsseldorf on monday to decide on a € 500 million capital increase - also necessary for the company 's restructuring . industry insiders report that karstadtquelle is also negotiating with further possible money lenders such as goldman sachs , to secure extra elbowroom for the company 's financial future . right road to recovery karstadtquelle 's restructuring plans have already been given the blessing of consultancy firm roland berger , which has said the company is " on the right path . " a further step will involve the naming of a chief restructuring officer , who will be tasked with implementing karstadtquelle 's recovery plan .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

" it 's a brutal development , as -lrb- european central bank chief -rrb- jean-claude trichet has said , " eichel said in an interview with german ard television .
" it will have to be talked about .
but , as befits currency issues , such discussions should take place behind closed doors and hopefully japan , the us and europe will be able to find a common position . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel 's comments , coming just a day before finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world 's 20 most powerful nations gather in berlin , are the clearest sign yet of germany 's concern . the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- comprises the world 's seven richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy japan and the us - as well as 13 others , china , india , russia , argentina , australia , brazil , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey and the eu . the g20 group accounts for 90 percent of the world 's total economy and around 80 percent of its trade .
it also comprises roughly two-thirds of the planet 's population .

some eu officials have been critical of the united states for its massive budget and balance of payments deficits , but snow argues that most of europe is suffering from a " growth deficit , " and that the us deficits will come down when the rest of the world picks up the pace of economic growth . germany , with its export-driven economy , is particularly sensitive to the damage that could be wrought should the dollar continue to slide .
however , eichel is unlikely to be able to convince snow of the need to have concerted central bank action in the foreign exchange markets . " everybody knows what our position is - a strong dollar , -lrb- and -rrb- currency values set in open markets , " snow said during a visit to poland before heading to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc chirac calls for multi-polar world speaking on thursday at an event organized by the london-based international institute for strategic studies , jacques chirac said " it is by recognizing the new reality of a multi-polar and interdependent world that we will succeed in building a sounder and fairer international order .
this is why we must work together to revive multilateralism , a multilateralism based on a reformed and strengthened united nations . "
chirac also said that the world should not be based on a " logic of power " as it would eventually lead to conflict or crisis .
both the french president and british prime minister tony blair , who were marking the 100th anniversary of the entente cordiale between the two countries , sought to overcome their differences on the war in iraq .
" the differences at the time of the conflict were well known but ... both of us want to see a stable and democratic iraq and will do what we can to ensure that happens " , said blair on thursday .

both the french president and british prime minister tony blair , who were marking the 100th anniversary of the entente cordiale between the two countries , sought to overcome their differences on the war in iraq .
" the differences at the time of the conflict were well known but ... both of us want to see a stable and democratic iraq and will do what we can to ensure that happens " , said blair on thursday .
according to mr chirac , iraq is the " one and only issue " on which london and paris disagreed .
" who is right or wrong , history will tell " , he said .

in return the eu is offering increased trade and political ties as part of its european neighbourhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
the prospect for belarusian participation in the enp has been on the table for some time , however , the statement looks set to offer a more gradual , bit-by-bit approach to developing ties .
it also comes after elections and a referendum which international observers say were deeply flawed .
the three-page text furthermore , sets out a series of concrete measures to help strengthen democrats in the country among them " directly and indirectly " supporting " democratic forces " and promoting closer eu integration " to the belarusian population at large . "
as recently threatened , the eu will also extend its visa ban against " officials directly responsible for the fraudulent elections and referendum . "

" to put norwegian forces at foreign command is in conflict with the constitution , " said professor stale eskeland at the oslo university according to norwegian daily aftenposten .
defense minister kristn krohn devold has guaranteed that norway would keep control on what specific tasks norwegian soldiers are to take up .
professor eivind smithm also from the oslo university doubted however that such a veto right would exist .
" these battle groups must be operational within 10 days .
i doubt any state could say ' no we do not participate ' in that short period , " he told aftenposten .
the eu battle groups project will see the creation of groups of 1,500 soldiers , which could be sent to international trouble spots from 2007 , according to the " headline goal 2010 " document , adopted by eu defesce ministers in brussels in may .
on nov .
25 , eu defense ministers will meet in brussels where each of them is to announce their contribution to the common battle groups .
finland and sweden have agreed to set up a joint nordic battle group as their contribution to an eu rapidly deployable force .
the deal was announced by swedish prime minister göran persson and finnish prime minister matti vanhanen during a meeting in october at which they also urged norway to join the group .
norway has twice voted against joining the european union but regularly aligns itself with eu statements and contributes to the eu budget .
norway is a full member of nato .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .
so it was half a victory for the parliament , as the fiercely attacked dutch candidate neelie kroes remains responsible for competition regulations .
hungary refused to pull back its candidate laszlo kovacs .
he only had to switch portfolios .
a second chance for barroso former portuguese prime minister barroso emerges weakened from this showdown .
this summer , he started off full of hope and energy , after state and government leaders agreed on barroso only at the end of a long dispute and an emergency summit .
but his egocentric leadership and his lack of diplomatic finesse in dealing with the parliament has since appalled many in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg represents the people of europe .
barroso now has a second chance , which he wants to use to reorganize his relationship to the parliament and the council of europe .
and he has to prove that he will be a stronger commission president than his predecessor romani prodi , who was less assertive .
in the next five years , barroso wants his commission to implement the " lisbon strategy , " promoting economic growth , employment and innovation in europe .
but prodi already found its implementation a hard nut to crack .
the national governments are lacking the will and capability for reforms .
in the interest of europe 's citizens , it would be desirable if barroso had more success .
a conflict of interest the barroso commission will be focussing on competition , the single european market , as well as industrial policies .
in this context , the dutch commissioner kroes could turn out to be a burden .
she may be competent in terms of expertise .
but the parliament will use every opportunity to accuse her of a conflict of interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch commissioner neelie kroes caused quite a dispute among meps .
kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- held various positions in european supervisory boards , disclosed consultancy contracts only reluctantly and even did n't rule out that she might have to declare herself biased in the case of some decisions .
it is already clear now that she will have to stand aside from three significant investigations immediately after taking office next week because of conflicts of interest .
but barroso also has to prove that the enlarged commission of 25 members can really work effectively .
after all , portfolios were hived off , which were previously under one roof in the old commission .
armed for the true opponent the european meps , which this summer were deeply frustrated following the low voter turnout in the european elections , emerge strengthened from the power struggle .
they have shown the astonished public that they do n't only nod their approval , but can also bare their teeth .
however , the meps did n't take themselves that seriously either .
only 680 of the 732 parliamentarians took part in the historical vote .
52 apparently had better things to do .
following this democratic exercise , which did n't - as many predicted - end in an eu crisis , the supranational institutions , the parliament and the commission , should now once again demonstrate their traditional unity .
for the actual opponent is the council of the european union , the governments of the member states , which follow their national interests . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert . the european union commission will take up its work this coming monday - three weeks late .
the power struggle between incoming commission president jose barroso and the members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- was one-of-a-kind .
on thursday , though , the majority of parliamentarians voted in favor of barroso 's new team .
the parliament 's flexing of muscles was by all means legitimate .
but the commission and assembly now have to tackle the bloc 's common tasks together , for example implementing the so-called " lisbon strategy . "
the european council adopted this policy in the portuguese capital in 2000 .
it aims to make the eu the world 's most dynamic and competitive economy .
it came as no surprise that barroso found support from the majority of meps for his revamped commission .
following the looming defeat in the vote three weeks ago , the incoming commission president succeeded in getting the eu 's heads of state and government to exchange two of the four commissioners criticized by the parliament .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

rail systems lack continuity throughout the eu the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network . the state of the train system in eastern europe , with its corroding rail and outdated wagons , was one of the main topics of conversation at the international railway conference held in berlin on friday . when traveling from berlin to the estonian capital of tallinn , one must not be running on too tight a schedule .
if the intrepid traveler needs anything on this journey , it 's time .
if things are running at the modest 28 kilometers -lrb- 17.4 miles -rrb- per hour that the train usually travels at , the 1,700 kilometer journey will take around 60 hours .
and that 's not including the very real possibility of delays . something that could keep the mind busy on such an ordeal would be how a steam train making the identical journey 70 years ago took half as long .
once you come to the conclusion that 's it all down to the bad infrastructure in the new eu member countries , the other 59 hours and 59 minutes could be spent boggling over the fact that only half of poland 's rail system is electrified while only a third is in the czech republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snail 's pace is made worse by out-of-date rails , creaky bridges , old fashioned carriages and faltering locomotives .
but while problems exist , it has not always been that way .
" traditionally , eastern europe has had a far-reaching railway system , " says ralf haase , head of the german organization for traffic research .
" however , the money for the necessary investments has been unavailable in recent years . " as a result , the railways have increasingly lost out to the roads in eastern europe .
since 1990 , the road network in eastern europe has grown by around a third and more and more freight is being carried on the highways . off the streets , onto the rails the european union has being watching this developing problem for a long time .
in 2001 , the european commission issued a report in which it mapped out its plan to shift heavy traffic off the street and onto the railways .
the ultimate goal would be the creation of a modern , trans-european traffic network which would bring eastern europe 's railways up to spec and allow freight to move around the continent solely by rail . however , such an undertaking will not be cheap .
sci verkehr , a traffic management consultancy , estimates that it will cost the eu € 235 billion -lrb- $ 306 billion -rrb- to create such a network , with half of that going to rail infrastructure .
former eu commissioner karel van miert had issued a similar ballpark figure , estimating € 220 billion would be needed .
with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .

with the european public coffers looking bare , either figure would be a colossal amount to find . the duty of all eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf haase sees the creation of the network as the duty of all eu countries .
" the national railroads must contribute to the investments .
brussels can only contribute in terms of co-financing , " according to the traffic expert .
haase is sure a solution can be found .
" everybody knows that without efficient railway systems , we are n't able to meet the challenges of the global economy . " for this to happen eu member states need to make their railways competitive .
the transport of goods and people should be made part of the domestic market , with every state opening up opportunities for others to use their networks .
but in reality , it 's harder than it sounds . according to a study by deutsche bahn , germany 's national train company , rail networks have only been liberalized in one-third of eu member states , to differing degrees of success .
great britain , sweden , the netherlands and germany have attempted to open up their railways to competition , while spain , greece and france still hold on to their nationalized systems . different systems create different problems another problem facing the utopian plan is the differing regulations and systems employed throughout europe .
in the eu alone , there are 15 different signal systems , three different rail gauges and five electrical currencies , which lead to massive delays at the borders . it 's no wonder that the average speed of european goods transported by rail is 13 kilometers .
europe faces a long and stressful journey if it is to develop locomotive harmony across the bloc . ralf jäckel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaks slammed on railway privatization plans to privatize germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , ahead of national elections in 2006 have been stopped in their tracks after the supervisory board deemed the timeframe " unrealistic .

animal rights activists say chasing the foxes is a cruel way to cull them .
hunters and other country-dwellers have pledged a massive campaign of civil disobedience to protest at what they perceive to be a class-based ban unfairly targeting a pursuit traditionally associated with the landed aristocracy . the ban would " draw a knife across centuries of tradition in our countryside " , lamented lord thomas strathclyde , leader of the opposition conservative party in the house of lords . however , blair 's labor party has twice been elected to power on a pledge to ban fox hunting , which opponents say is an unnecessarily cruel way to cull the animals . on thursday , the upper chamber had been given a final chance to approve a modified version of the measure , delaying a ban until july 2006 . but it refused to do so , a decision which had " brought us to the end of the road " , according to michael martin , the speaker , or chairman , of the house of commons , who formally invoked the parliament act . blair preferred compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fox on the grounds of london 's westminster abbey while a hunting ban is hugely popular with many labor members of parliament , blair himself has stood apart from the fray , personally favoring another compromise which would allow some fox hunting under license . during a joint press conference with chirac earlier thursday , blair said he accepted that the matter could not be resolved in parliament . " but i think probably , despite the very passionate views on either side of this debate , the majority of people would have preferred to have seen a compromise accepted , " he said . protests by pro-hunters could end up being a serious embarrassment to blair ahead of the election , as he seeks to unite a nation already deeply skeptical about his decision to back the iraq war . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain votes on fox hunting ban amid protests the british house of commons was poised wednesday to ram through a ban on fox hunting in england and wales , against the backdrop of angry protests from thousands of hunt supporters outside parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2004 press review : a stronger eu ? european editorials on friday had a lot to say about the new european commission which has now been approved by the eu parliament . european editorials are divided on whether they think the commission and the parliament have been strengthened or weakened by the whole process of approving the new executive . denmark ’ s politiken thought they both came out of this stronger .
it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .
but the paper asserted that it is difficult to tell if fini has changed - after all , his colleagues call him a chameleon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

but with a growing number of states falling foul of that rule , some governments , including berlin and paris , have embarked on a campaign to soften the pact and show greater leniency to so-called budgetary sinners .
weber , who as german central bank chief sits on the european central bank 's policy-setting governing council , insisted that the pact as it stood " suffers from neither a lack of economic reasoning nor a lack of clarity .

it said cooperation in the european union is better now following the tug of war over the new commissioners .
the daily observes that members of the european parliament made it clear they were willing to use their power , and the commission proved that it can negotiate constructively .
after all is said and done , the paper believed this is the strongest commission yet , and the fact that its president was portugal ’ s head of government shows that the executive is growing in political prestige . the parliament may be stronger now with an improved public image , wrote the taz in berlin , but the commission is definitely not better off .
italy reluctantly withdrew its controversial candidate as did latvia , but only because of a temporary power vacuum in the cabinet making it possible for barroso to get new candidates .
but the paper noted that the parliament was only concerned about two out of seven commission candidates .
the daily gave barroso some advice : if he wants to be more than just a puppet of european governments , then he needs to get parliament on his side during the next five years . the tages – anzeiger in zurich wasn ’ t sure if this whole episode was really a great moment in democracy or rather the beginning of a creeping crisis .
either way , it thought , it will be up to historians to judge .
many european union parliamentarians were pleased with themselves for fighting for a stronger europe because they didn ’ t just accept what eu governments were handing them .
the paper urged all eu institutions to work together towards the same goal and reduce their own personal interests .
and , it added , european citizens must be involved in the process - only then will they accept the necessary reforms to fix the european welfare state . austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten came to the defense of commission president jose barroso by pointing out that he has next to no influence over who the members of his team will be because they are handed to him by eu governments .
the paper suggested that this unusual nomination process wouldn ’ t be so bad if governments would at least send their best politicians to brussels , but they do so far too seldom . another austrian daily , die presse , looked at who ’ s replacing franco frattini as italy ’ s next foreign minister now that he ’ s gone to brussels .
the daily commented that gianfranco fini has learned that one has to be first politically house-trained before being allowed into the diplomatic chambers of a western european government .
it added that he long ago also learned to stop praising italy ’ s former , darker , fascist side .

they were later brought back on board by the other consortium members . the agreement on a credit line for karstadtquelle is of enormous significance to the company 's future development .
company shareholders are meeting in an extraordinary general meeting in düsseldorf on monday to decide on a € 500 million capital increase - also necessary for the company 's restructuring . industry insiders report that karstadtquelle is also negotiating with further possible money lenders such as goldman sachs , to secure extra elbowroom for the company 's financial future . right road to recovery karstadtquelle 's restructuring plans have already been given the blessing of consultancy firm roland berger , which has said the company is " on the right path . " a further step will involve the naming of a chief restructuring officer , who will be tasked with implementing karstadtquelle 's recovery plan .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- telecoms thriving in lawless somalia bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 06:30 gmt , friday , 19 november 2004 telecoms thriving in lawless somalia by joseph winter bbc news , mogadishu rising from the ruins of the mogadishu skyline are signs of one of somalia 's few success stories in the anarchy of recent years .
a host of mobile phone masts testifies to the telecommunications revolution which has taken place despite the absence of any functioning national government since 1991 .
three phone companies are engaged in fierce competition for both mobile and landline customers , while new internet cafes are being set up across the city and the entire country .
it takes just three days for a landline to be installed - compared with waiting-lists of many years in neighbouring kenya , where there is a stable , democratic government .
and once installed , local calls are free for a monthly fee of just $ 10 .
international calls cost 50 us cents a minute , while surfing the web is charged at 50 us cents an hour - " the cheapest rate in africa " according to the manager of one internet cafe .
but how do you establish a phone company in a country where there is no government ?
no monopoly in some respects , it is actually easier .
there is no need to get a licence and there is no state-run monopoly which prevents new competitors being established .
and of course there is no-one to demand any taxes , which is one reason why prices are so low .
" the government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled , we were free to set up our own business , " says abdullahi mohammed hussein , products and services manager of telcom somalia , which was set up in 1994 when mogadishu was still a war-zone .
" we saw a huge gap in the market , as all previous services had been destroyed .
there was a massive demand . "
the main airport and port were destroyed in the fighting but businessmen have built small airstrips and use natural harbours , so the phone companies are still able to import their equipment .
despite the absence of law and order and a functional court system , bills are paid and contracts are enforced by relying on somalia 's traditional clan system , mr abdullahi says .
mobile target but in a country divided into hundreds of fiefdoms run by rival warlords , security is a major concern .
while telcom somalia has some 25,000 mobile customers - and a similar number have land lines - you very rarely see anyone walking along the streets of mogadishu chatting on their phone , in case this attracts the attention of a hungry gunman . "
we are very interested in paying taxes " abdullahi mohammed hussein telcom somalia life in somalia : have your say the phone companies themselves say they are not targeted by the militiamen , even if thieves occasionally steal some of their wires .
mahdi mohammed elmi has been managing the wireless african broadband telecoms internet cafe in the heart of mogadishu , surrounded by the bustling and chaotic bakara market , for almost two years .
" i have never had a problem with security , " he says and points out that they have just a single security guard at the front door .
mr abdullahi says the warlords realise that if they cause trouble for the phone companies , the phones will stop working again , which nobody wants .
" we need good relations with all the faction leaders .
we do n't interfere with them and they do n't interfere with us .
they want political power and we leave them alone , " he says .
selling goats on the net while the three phone companies - telcom , nationlink and hormuud - are engaged in bitter competition for phone customers , they have co-operated to set up the global internet company to provide the internet infrastructure .
manager abdulkadir hassan ahmed says that within 1.5km of central mogadishu , customers - mostly internet cafes - can enjoy service at 150mb / second through a long reach ethernet .
elsewhere , they can have a wireless connection at 11mb / s .
he says his company is able to work anywhere in somalia , whichever faction is in charge locally .
" even small , remote villages are connected to the internet , as long as they have a phone line , " he says .
the internet sector in somalia has two main advantages over many of its africa neighbours .
there is a huge diaspora around the world - between one and three million people , compared with an estimated seven million people in somalia - who remain in contact with their friends and relatives back home .
e-mail is the cheapest way of staying in touch and many somalis can read and write their own language , instead of relying on english or french , which restricts internet users to a smaller number of well educated people .
just two days after it was opened , the orbit internet cafe in south mogadishu 's km5 was already pretty busy , with people checking their e-mail accounts , a livestock exporter sending out his invoices and two nurses doing medical research .
video calling and somalia 's telecoms revolution is far from over .
" we are planning to introduce 3g technology , including live video calling and mobile internet , next year , " says mr abdullahi .
but despite their success , the telecoms companies say that like the population at large , they are desperate to have a government .
" we are very interested in paying taxes , " says mr abdullahi - not a sentiment which often passes the lips of a high-flying businessman .
and mr abdulkadir at the global internet company fully agrees .
" we badly need a government , " he says .
" everything starts with security - the situation across the country .
" all the infrastructure of the country has collapsed - education , health and roads .
we need to send our staff abroad for any training . "
another problem for companies engaged in the global telecoms business is paying their foreign partners .
at present , they use somalia 's traditional " hawala " money transfer companies to get money to dubai , the middle east 's trading and financial hub .
with a government would come a central bank , which would make such transactions far easier .
taxes would mean higher prices but mr abdullahi says that somalia 's previous governments have kept taxes low and hopes this will continue under the regime due to start work in the coming months .
somalia 's telecoms companies are looking forward to an even brighter future with the support of a functioning government - as long as it does not impose punitive tax rates or state control in a sector which obviously needs very little help to thrive .

mobile phone masts are among the few new structures in mogadishu a host of mobile phone masts testifies to the telecommunications revolution which has taken place despite the absence of any functioning national government since 1991 .
three phone companies are engaged in fierce competition for both mobile and landline customers , while new internet cafes are being set up across the city and the entire country .
it takes just three days for a landline to be installed - compared with waiting-lists of many years in neighbouring kenya , where there is a stable , democratic government .
and once installed , local calls are free for a monthly fee of just $ 10 .
international calls cost 50 us cents a minute , while surfing the web is charged at 50 us cents an hour - " the cheapest rate in africa " according to the manager of one internet cafe .
but how do you establish a phone company in a country where there is no government ?
no monopoly in some respects , it is actually easier .
there is no need to get a licence and there is no state-run monopoly which prevents new competitors being established .
voices of somali internet users in pictures and of course there is no-one to demand any taxes , which is one reason why prices are so low .
" the government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled , we were free to set up our own business , " says abdullahi mohammed hussein , products and services manager of telcom somalia , which was set up in 1994 when mogadishu was still a war-zone .
" we saw a huge gap in the market , as all previous services had been destroyed .
there was a massive demand . "
the main airport and port were destroyed in the fighting but businessmen have built small airstrips and use natural harbours , so the phone companies are still able to import their equipment .
despite the absence of law and order and a functional court system , bills are paid and contracts are enforced by relying on somalia 's traditional clan system , mr abdullahi says .
mobile target but in a country divided into hundreds of fiefdoms run by rival warlords , security is a major concern .
while telcom somalia has some 25,000 mobile customers - and a similar number have land lines - you very rarely see anyone walking along the streets of mogadishu chatting on their phone , in case this attracts the attention of a hungry gunman .
we are very interested in paying taxes abdullahi mohammed hussein telcom somalia life in somalia : have your say the phone companies themselves say they are not targeted by the militiamen , even if thieves occasionally steal some of their wires .
mahdi mohammed elmi has been managing the wireless african broadband telecoms internet cafe in the heart of mogadishu , surrounded by the bustling and chaotic bakara market , for almost two years .
" i have never had a problem with security , " he says and points out that they have just a single security guard at the front door .
mr abdullahi says the warlords realise that if they cause trouble for the phone companies , the phones will stop working again , which nobody wants .
" we need good relations with all the faction leaders .
we do n't interfere with them and they do n't interfere with us .
they want political power and we leave them alone , " he says .
selling goats on the net while the three phone companies - telcom , nationlink and hormuud - are engaged in bitter competition for phone customers , they have co-operated to set up the global internet company to provide the internet infrastructure .
somali traders say if business is better without a government in pictures manager abdulkadir hassan ahmed says that within 1.5km of central mogadishu , customers - mostly internet cafes - can enjoy service at 150mb / second through a long reach ethernet .
elsewhere , they can have a wireless connection at 11mb / s .
he says his company is able to work anywhere in somalia , whichever faction is in charge locally .
" even small , remote villages are connected to the internet , as long as they have a phone line , " he says .
the internet sector in somalia has two main advantages over many of its africa neighbours .
there is a huge diaspora around the world - between one and three million people , compared with an estimated seven million people in somalia - who remain in contact with their friends and relatives back home .
somalis send e-mails in their own language e-mail is the cheapest way of staying in touch and many somalis can read and write their own language , instead of relying on english or french , which restricts internet users to a smaller number of well educated people .
just two days after it was opened , the orbit internet cafe in south mogadishu 's km5 was already pretty busy , with people checking their e-mail accounts , a livestock exporter sending out his invoices and two nurses doing medical research .
video calling and somalia 's telecoms revolution is far from over .
" we are planning to introduce 3g technology , including live video calling and mobile internet , next year , " says mr abdullahi .
but despite their success , the telecoms companies say that like the population at large , they are desperate to have a government .
mogadishu 's phone engineers are going to be kept busy " we are very interested in paying taxes , " says mr abdullahi - not a sentiment which often passes the lips of a high-flying businessman .
and mr abdulkadir at the global internet company fully agrees .
" we badly need a government , " he says .
" everything starts with security - the situation across the country .
" all the infrastructure of the country has collapsed - education , health and roads .
we need to send our staff abroad for any training . "
another problem for companies engaged in the global telecoms business is paying their foreign partners .
at present , they use somalia 's traditional " hawala " money transfer companies to get money to dubai , the middle east 's trading and financial hub .
with a government would come a central bank , which would make such transactions far easier .
taxes would mean higher prices but mr abdullahi says that somalia 's previous governments have kept taxes low and hopes this will continue under the regime due to start work in the coming months .
somalia 's telecoms companies are looking forward to an even brighter future with the support of a functioning government - as long as it does not impose punitive tax rates or state control in a sector which obviously needs very little help to thrive .

just two days after it was opened , the orbit internet cafe in south mogadishu 's km5 was already pretty busy , with people checking their e-mail accounts , a livestock exporter sending out his invoices and two nurses doing medical research .
video calling and somalia 's telecoms revolution is far from over .
" we are planning to introduce 3g technology , including live video calling and mobile internet , next year , " says mr abdullahi .
but despite their success , the telecoms companies say that like the population at large , they are desperate to have a government .
mogadishu 's phone engineers are going to be kept busy " we are very interested in paying taxes , " says mr abdullahi - not a sentiment which often passes the lips of a high-flying businessman .
and mr abdulkadir at the global internet company fully agrees .
" we badly need a government , " he says .
" everything starts with security - the situation across the country .
" all the infrastructure of the country has collapsed - education , health and roads .
we need to send our staff abroad for any training . "
another problem for companies engaged in the global telecoms business is paying their foreign partners .
at present , they use somalia 's traditional " hawala " money transfer companies to get money to dubai , the middle east 's trading and financial hub .
with a government would come a central bank , which would make such transactions far easier .
taxes would mean higher prices but mr abdullahi says that somalia 's previous governments have kept taxes low and hopes this will continue under the regime due to start work in the coming months .
somalia 's telecoms companies are looking forward to an even brighter future with the support of a functioning government - as long as it does not impose punitive tax rates or state control in a sector which obviously needs very little help to thrive .

mobile phone masts are among the few new structures in mogadishu a host of mobile phone masts testifies to the telecommunications revolution which has taken place despite the absence of any functioning national government since 1991 .
three phone companies are engaged in fierce competition for both mobile and landline customers , while new internet cafes are being set up across the city and the entire country .
it takes just three days for a landline to be installed - compared with waiting-lists of many years in neighbouring kenya , where there is a stable , democratic government .
and once installed , local calls are free for a monthly fee of just $ 10 .
international calls cost 50 us cents a minute , while surfing the web is charged at 50 us cents an hour - " the cheapest rate in africa " according to the manager of one internet cafe .
but how do you establish a phone company in a country where there is no government ?
no monopoly in some respects , it is actually easier .
there is no need to get a licence and there is no state-run monopoly which prevents new competitors being established .
voices of somali internet users in pictures and of course there is no-one to demand any taxes , which is one reason why prices are so low .
" the government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled , we were free to set up our own business , " says abdullahi mohammed hussein , products and services manager of telcom somalia , which was set up in 1994 when mogadishu was still a war-zone .
" we saw a huge gap in the market , as all previous services had been destroyed .
there was a massive demand . "
the main airport and port were destroyed in the fighting but businessmen have built small airstrips and use natural harbours , so the phone companies are still able to import their equipment .
despite the absence of law and order and a functional court system , bills are paid and contracts are enforced by relying on somalia 's traditional clan system , mr abdullahi says .
mobile target but in a country divided into hundreds of fiefdoms run by rival warlords , security is a major concern .
while telcom somalia has some 25,000 mobile customers - and a similar number have land lines - you very rarely see anyone walking along the streets of mogadishu chatting on their phone , in case this attracts the attention of a hungry gunman .
we are very interested in paying taxes abdullahi mohammed hussein telcom somalia life in somalia : have your say the phone companies themselves say they are not targeted by the militiamen , even if thieves occasionally steal some of their wires .
mahdi mohammed elmi has been managing the wireless african broadband telecoms internet cafe in the heart of mogadishu , surrounded by the bustling and chaotic bakara market , for almost two years .
" i have never had a problem with security , " he says and points out that they have just a single security guard at the front door .
mr abdullahi says the warlords realise that if they cause trouble for the phone companies , the phones will stop working again , which nobody wants .
" we need good relations with all the faction leaders .
we do n't interfere with them and they do n't interfere with us .
they want political power and we leave them alone , " he says .
selling goats on the net while the three phone companies - telcom , nationlink and hormuud - are engaged in bitter competition for phone customers , they have co-operated to set up the global internet company to provide the internet infrastructure .
somali traders say if business is better without a government in pictures manager abdulkadir hassan ahmed says that within 1.5km of central mogadishu , customers - mostly internet cafes - can enjoy service at 150mb / second through a long reach ethernet .
elsewhere , they can have a wireless connection at 11mb / s .
he says his company is able to work anywhere in somalia , whichever faction is in charge locally .
" even small , remote villages are connected to the internet , as long as they have a phone line , " he says .
the internet sector in somalia has two main advantages over many of its africa neighbours .
there is a huge diaspora around the world - between one and three million people , compared with an estimated seven million people in somalia - who remain in contact with their friends and relatives back home .
somalis send e-mails in their own language e-mail is the cheapest way of staying in touch and many somalis can read and write their own language , instead of relying on english or french , which restricts internet users to a smaller number of well educated people .

the bank said scotland has one of the uk 's lowest levels of ownership but it has seen the fastest growth in the past 10 years .
the highest level of owner occupation was in east renfrewshire , followed by east dunbartonshire .
the lowest level of home ownership was in glasgow .
the bank said the right-to-buy scheme has been a significant factor in the rise , along with the increased supply of new housing developments within commuting distance of the main cities .
the bank put owner occupation at 64 % in scotland , well below rates of 76 % and 75 % in the south east and south west of england respectively .
highest and lowest in scotland east renfrewshire 83 % east dunbartonshire 81 % orkney islands 72 % western isles 72 % aberdeenshire 71 % south ayrshire 71 % edinburgh city 69 % inverclyde 60 % east ayrshire 59 % clackmannanshire 58 % north lanarkshire 58 % dundee city 54 % west dunbartonshire 54 % glasgow city 49 % however , there has been a 12 % growth in home ownership in the past 10 years , three times the average growth in the rest of the uk .
in east renfrewshire , 83 % of homes were owner- occupied , followed by 81 % in east dunbartonshire .
these were well above the uk average of 70 % .
the lowest rate of owner occupation in scotland - 49 % - was in glasgow city , with the lowest rates in the uk found in the central london boroughs of tower hamlets -lrb- 29 % -rrb- and southwark -lrb- 31 % -rrb- .
tim crawford , bank of scotland group economist , said : " the massive growth in owner occupation levels in scotland over the last 10 years reflects the fact that it is the most affordable place to live in the uk .
" in scotland there is about a 35 % difference between the highest and lowest areas of owner-occupation .
