the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit reporter we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .

" the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel . " eu strikes back the european union responded to the us action by launching a counterattack , taking its own complaint about rival boeing to the wto in the brewing aviation trade war . attacking the us complaint with the wto , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement : " if this is the path the us has chosen , we accept the challenge , not least because it is high time to put an end to massive illegal us subsidies to boeing which damage airbus , in particular those for boeings new 7e7 program . " the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the town 's real treasure actually lies a few kilometers -lrb- miles -rrb- away from the center . there , visitors can find a business park with companies representing almost every sector .
about 175 firms , many of them operating internationally , have set up shop here over the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölleda 's business park the area is the pride of frank zweimann , who has served as kölleda 's mayor since 1992 , when many of the town 's residents began losing their jobs because the old east german factories began closing down . but zweimann did n't want kölleda to go down without putting up a fight . " we bet on the future , " he told deutsche welle . it was a smart decision to make : while zweimann 's colleagues complain about empty coffers , kölleda 's mayor has seen business tax revenues double over the last five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a metal and tool production company has also settled in kölleda he 's been investing the money in improving the town 's infrastructure to attract even more companies .
the business park is equipped with state-of-the-art water , electricity and telecommunications connections .
a railway line and kölleda 's proximity to a highway allow firms to quickly transport their goods elsewhere . big time investors all this keeps attracting more investors , including large international concerns .
carmaker daimlerchrysler has spent € 250 million -lrb- $ 306 million -rrb- on an engine production plant in kölleda , choosing the town over 59 other contenders .
the plant has created 400 new jobs . the town 's real success story can be found at funkwerk .
the company has been in business for almost 60 years and survived the collapse of the east german economy .
today , funkwerk 's 350 employees produce communications systems for trains throughout europe . since its initial public offering four years ago , funkwerk 's revenue and profits have kept climbing .
last year , the company 's profit came to almost € 18 million .
funkwerk has been listed on germany 's texdax stock index since september , making it one of the country 's top technology companies . not all is well in kölleda but the success has n't rubbed off on all of kölleda 's residents .
the town might be doing better than others , but every sixth person living here is still unemployed . zweimann blames this on the overall economic downturn , saying that the town can not completely separate itself from what happens elsewhere in the country .
the mayor expects unemployment to stay high for the foreseeable future . but that 's no reason to change strategy , he said , adding that kölleda will continue to pump its surplus funds into the business park - to attract more firms that will create more jobs . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9801 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today - the science magazine we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9801 dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9801 keep up to date tune in to the latest news and current affairs .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .

" the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9799 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel . " eu strikes back the european union responded to the us action by launching a counterattack , taking its own complaint about rival boeing to the wto in the brewing aviation trade war . attacking the us complaint with the wto , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement : " if this is the path the us has chosen , we accept the challenge , not least because it is high time to put an end to massive illegal us subsidies to boeing which damage airbus , in particular those for boeings new 7e7 program . " the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft .

the current make-up of the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - is criticized for no longer reflecting global realities and there is broad agreement that an expansion and overhaul is overdue . more recently , schröder and singh met the leaders of japan and brazil , the other two promising aspirants for a permanent security council seat on the sidelines of the un general assembly last month to evolve a strategy to support one another 's candidature 's . good chances on thursday , schröder reaffirmed close indo-german cooperation in the field .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .

" in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9799 dw-tv europe live made in germany - das wirtschaftsmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .

" the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .

" the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9797 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9797 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the town 's real treasure actually lies a few kilometers -lrb- miles -rrb- away from the center . there , visitors can find a business park with companies representing almost every sector .
about 175 firms , many of them operating internationally , have set up shop here over the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölleda 's business park the area is the pride of frank zweimann , who has served as kölleda 's mayor since 1992 , when many of the town 's residents began losing their jobs because the old east german factories began closing down . but zweimann did n't want kölleda to go down without putting up a fight . " we bet on the future , " he told deutsche welle . it was a smart decision to make : while zweimann 's colleagues complain about empty coffers , kölleda 's mayor has seen business tax revenues double over the last five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a metal and tool production company has also settled in kölleda he 's been investing the money in improving the town 's infrastructure to attract even more companies .
the business park is equipped with state-of-the-art water , electricity and telecommunications connections .
a railway line and kölleda 's proximity to a highway allow firms to quickly transport their goods elsewhere . big time investors all this keeps attracting more investors , including large international concerns .
carmaker daimlerchrysler has spent € 250 million -lrb- $ 306 million -rrb- on an engine production plant in kölleda , choosing the town over 59 other contenders .
the plant has created 400 new jobs . the town 's real success story can be found at funkwerk .
the company has been in business for almost 60 years and survived the collapse of the east german economy .
today , funkwerk 's 350 employees produce communications systems for trains throughout europe . since its initial public offering four years ago , funkwerk 's revenue and profits have kept climbing .
last year , the company 's profit came to almost € 18 million .
funkwerk has been listed on germany 's texdax stock index since september , making it one of the country 's top technology companies . not all is well in kölleda but the success has n't rubbed off on all of kölleda 's residents .
the town might be doing better than others , but every sixth person living here is still unemployed . zweimann blames this on the overall economic downturn , saying that the town can not completely separate itself from what happens elsewhere in the country .
the mayor expects unemployment to stay high for the foreseeable future . but that 's no reason to change strategy , he said , adding that kölleda will continue to pump its surplus funds into the business park - to attract more firms that will create more jobs . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel . " eu strikes back the european union responded to the us action by launching a counterattack , taking its own complaint about rival boeing to the wto in the brewing aviation trade war . attacking the us complaint with the wto , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement : " if this is the path the us has chosen , we accept the challenge , not least because it is high time to put an end to massive illegal us subsidies to boeing which damage airbus , in particular those for boeings new 7e7 program . " the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .
boeing has forecast a need for 2,000-3,000 airplanes in the 7e7 market segment over the next 20 years . afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show 9800 dw-tv europe live europa aktuell - das magazin aus brüssel we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.10.2004 airbus strikes back at boeing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying the not-so-friendly skies the us has filed a complaint with the wto over eu subsidies paid to airbus , a rival of us plane manufacturer boeing .
the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .

the town 's real treasure actually lies a few kilometers -lrb- miles -rrb- away from the center . there , visitors can find a business park with companies representing almost every sector .
about 175 firms , many of them operating internationally , have set up shop here over the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölleda 's business park the area is the pride of frank zweimann , who has served as kölleda 's mayor since 1992 , when many of the town 's residents began losing their jobs because the old east german factories began closing down . but zweimann did n't want kölleda to go down without putting up a fight . " we bet on the future , " he told deutsche welle . it was a smart decision to make : while zweimann 's colleagues complain about empty coffers , kölleda 's mayor has seen business tax revenues double over the last five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a metal and tool production company has also settled in kölleda he 's been investing the money in improving the town 's infrastructure to attract even more companies .
the business park is equipped with state-of-the-art water , electricity and telecommunications connections .
a railway line and kölleda 's proximity to a highway allow firms to quickly transport their goods elsewhere . big time investors all this keeps attracting more investors , including large international concerns .
carmaker daimlerchrysler has spent € 250 million -lrb- $ 306 million -rrb- on an engine production plant in kölleda , choosing the town over 59 other contenders .
the plant has created 400 new jobs . the town 's real success story can be found at funkwerk .
the company has been in business for almost 60 years and survived the collapse of the east german economy .
today , funkwerk 's 350 employees produce communications systems for trains throughout europe . since its initial public offering four years ago , funkwerk 's revenue and profits have kept climbing .
last year , the company 's profit came to almost € 18 million .
funkwerk has been listed on germany 's texdax stock index since september , making it one of the country 's top technology companies . not all is well in kölleda but the success has n't rubbed off on all of kölleda 's residents .
the town might be doing better than others , but every sixth person living here is still unemployed . zweimann blames this on the overall economic downturn , saying that the town can not completely separate itself from what happens elsewhere in the country .
the mayor expects unemployment to stay high for the foreseeable future . but that 's no reason to change strategy , he said , adding that kölleda will continue to pump its surplus funds into the business park - to attract more firms that will create more jobs . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world .

a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc us " desperate " to get eu support on iraq eu watcher philip h. gordon , has thrashed the current bush administration ’ s isolationist stance and urged the eu not to waste the opportunity presented in the aftermath of us elections to compromise over iraq .
" we desperately need european support in the current international issues , " assured the director of the centre of the united states and europe at the brookings institution , one of washington 's oldest think tanks , speaking at a conference on transatlantic relations in lisbon .
gordon has been campaigning for a roosevelt-like " new deal " to save what he considers to be the " most successful alliance in history " for over a year .
he warned the audience that the future of world security would depend on the successful relation between the two powers .
in his opinion , europe should not waste this opportunity to reinforce its presence in the iraqi peace-building effort , strengthening the transatlantic bond .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel . " eu strikes back the european union responded to the us action by launching a counterattack , taking its own complaint about rival boeing to the wto in the brewing aviation trade war . attacking the us complaint with the wto , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement : " if this is the path the us has chosen , we accept the challenge , not least because it is high time to put an end to massive illegal us subsidies to boeing which damage airbus , in particular those for boeings new 7e7 program . " the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us square up over airbus and boeing bush mulls wto suit against airbus airbus , boeing duel at air show dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the eu has struck back with a complaint of its own . airbus reacted forcefully thursday to a us complaint filed with the world trade organization this week over european state aid for the european aircraft manufacturer , saying washington 's move underscored rival boeing 's dependence on " wto-incompatible subsidies " . " the path chosen by the us government underscores our belief that the 7e7 program is only viable because of the wto-inconsistent subsidies granted to it - subsidies which were already prohibited by the 1992 agreement , " airbus said in a statement . earlier in the day , the wto confirmed that the united states had triggered the global trade body 's disputes settlement procedure by asking for formal consultations with the european union over eu subsidies paid to airbus .
the two parties now have 60 days to start negotiations to find a solution to the dispute on their own , a wto spokesman said . under international trade rules , if they fail to find a negotiated settlement , the wto will then appoint an independent panel of experts at the request of the us to examine and rule on the complaint . us takes a hard line us trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had been trying to convince the european commission to halt billions of dollars in " unfair subsidies " to airbus .
" but the eu and airbus appear to want to buy more time for more subsidies for more planes , " he said in a statement . " that is n't fair and it violates international trade rules .
since we could not agree , the united states decided to pursue resolution through the agreed procedures of the multilateral trading system , by bringing a wto case before an international dispute resolution panel . " eu strikes back the european union responded to the us action by launching a counterattack , taking its own complaint about rival boeing to the wto in the brewing aviation trade war . attacking the us complaint with the wto , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement : " if this is the path the us has chosen , we accept the challenge , not least because it is high time to put an end to massive illegal us subsidies to boeing which damage airbus , in particular those for boeings new 7e7 program . " the complaints followed a failure to renegotiate a 12-year-old transatlantic accord limiting government support to airplane manufacturers .
subsidies had been allowed under a 1992 us-eu agreement which the united states decided to scrap . competition heats-up competition between boeing and airbus has become intense in recent years as the european group increased its share of the market for passenger aircraft . " the market will now draw its own conclusions on the viability of the 7e7 , a program which depends vitally on wto-incompatible subsidies , " airbus said in its statement . boeing 's next generation fuel-efficient mid-sized 7e7 dreamliner jet , holding 200 to 300 passengers , is a key project in boeing 's struggle with airbus in the civilian aircraft sector .
boeing has forecast a need for 2,000-3,000 airplanes in the 7e7 market segment over the next 20 years . afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" we desperately need european support in the current international issues , " assured the director of the centre of the united states and europe at the brookings institution , one of washington 's oldest think tanks , speaking at a conference on transatlantic relations in lisbon .
gordon has been campaigning for a roosevelt-like " new deal " to save what he considers to be the " most successful alliance in history " for over a year .
he warned the audience that the future of world security would depend on the successful relation between the two powers .
in his opinion , europe should not waste this opportunity to reinforce its presence in the iraqi peace-building effort , strengthening the transatlantic bond .
he conceded that a kerry-edwards administration would be better suited for this rapprochement , but claimed that even the current bush-cheney administration would have to reach out to the international community if re-elected .
gordon linked the nuclear standoff in iran to the transatlantic divide .
" the iranians have sought to exploit the differences between us , " he said , adding that " more eu carrots , together with american sticks " are necessary to convince tehran to follow libya ’ s example .
iran ’ s denuclearisation " is not impossible , and it is necessary , " he emphasized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2004 bringing the brains back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luring young scientists back to germany has become a priority the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .
a number of similar programs have sprung up , but are they working ? thousands of german scientists and academics are currently working abroad , many of them in the united states .
the lopsided flow of germany 's " best and brightest " to academic institutions overseas has sent off alarm signals and prompted several new initiatives to lure them back . the new york-based german academic international network -lrb- gain -rrb- is one such project .
a joint effort of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- and the alexander von humboldt foundation -lrb- avh -rrb- , the network is celebrating its one year anniversary this week .
another similar project , the german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- , headquartered in san francisco , also recently passed the one year mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent study questions how many young researchers are staying abroad .
in a handy division of labor , gain has focused on distributing information and creating a forum for german scientists working abroad , while the gso has taken a more practical approach and started an online job bank to match candidates with openings .
both have been complemented by new individual initiatives - fellowships , grants - offered by germany 's top research and funding organizations . but a year into the start of the all-out offensive to counter brain drain with brain gain , the jury 's still out on whether such efforts are proving effective .
meanwhile , a recently published study conducted by the german research council -lrb- dfg -rrb- has questioned the extent of the crisis . extent of crisis hard to pinpoint the dfg study , published in may of this year , found that 85 percent of scientists who leave germany eventually return home .
however the study only looked at a very specific group , those who received post-doctoral fellowships from the dfg .
still , the figures contradicted previous , largely anecdotal estimates that have painted a more dire picture . according to the alarmists , the brain drain phenomenon is not unique to germany but a europe-wide problem .
for example , in november of 2003 , the european commission reported that 75 percent of eu citizens who obtained a doctorate in the united states had no plans to return to europe .
in germany , a study conducted by the german science foundation came out somewhere in the middle , finding that 43 percent of german scientists abroad had no intention of returning home , while 44 percent for undecided or willing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students relax in front of a building belonging to heidelberg university indeed , the extend of the crisis has remained hard to dispute .
but if the dfg study is correct , and those 15 percent who remain abroad are the best in their field , that could still represent a significant loss for germany , beate scholz a dfg spokeswoman , told dw-world . " the numbers might not be that large , but we could have a problem in terms of quality , " she said . scholz pointed to yet another study commissioned by the german federal ministry for science and research that found those who remained abroad were among the most highly qualified in their field . rigid system with uncertain prospects steffen berg , a physicist at princeton university who researches surface active agents , is one of the german researchers currently living in the us who would like to return .
but he also understands the frustrations of those who are n't so eager to follow his lead . " germany is pretty good at educating people to a certain level , but then it gets difficult because there are limited options , " he told dw-world . berg has heard numerous complaints from his colleagues .
some focus on the antiquated so-called " habilitation " system in germany , which requires post-doctoral researchers to work with tenured professors for several years and complete another thesis before they can become professors themselves .
others cite young researchers ' lack of independence . old boy 's network a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk across princeton university 's campus some , according to berg , are also put off by the insider " old boys network " of the german scientific community , where jobs do not always go to the most highly qualified candidates , but those with the best connections . " in germany , sometimes your chance of getting a good professor position has less to do with the quality of your work and more to do with your contacts , " berg said . despite such misgivings , berg would still like to return home , and he credits projects such as the gain initiative and new fellowship opportunities with luring him back . new programs change attitudes in recent years , german research institutions have taken steps to make the prospect of pursuing a career in germany more appealing to young researchers , and for many that has meant ushering in a host of new programs to provide those scientists with the much-wished-for independence . the emmy noether program , administrated by the german research foundation , is one such initiative , and the young investigators award , offered by the helmholtz association , is another .
both give young researchers enough funding to establish their own labs and pursue independent work for up to four and five years respectively . berg , who is applying for the noether fellowship program , said the prospect of working independently has certainly been an incentive .
but he and other young scientists abroad may not have known about the new opportunities if it was n't for the efforts of gain , he said , and in that case he gives credit where credit is due . everybody just wants to be loved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to see its scientists step through border control and remain in the country but at the end of the day , it 's just nice to feel needed , berg said , adding that gain has certainly helped to better inform him and other young scientists about new opportunities .
but it has also made him feel sought after . " it 's nice to feel like my return is appreciated , " he said . at a recent event held at mit in boston , the directors of some of germany 's most prestigious research institutions were on hand to underline that point , katja simons the project manager for gain , told dw-world . " they were sending a very important signal to these young scientists : you are important to us , " she said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german group starts " brain gain " effort around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .

the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus . the battle between america 's boeing and europe 's airbus reached fever pitch on wednesday when the us government launched an official complaint at the world trade organisation over what it calls unfair subsidies to the european airline manufacturer airbus .
the us government and boeing argue that airbus which now delivers more airlines worldwide than its american competitor boeing has outgrown the need for support from european taxpayers to help it launch planes onto the market .
europe provides loans to airbus to help develop new airlines , and for aircraft construction or to assist it launch new planes onto the market .
however the eu lost no time in launching a counter suit , charging that boeing has received some $ 23 billion in us subsidies since 1992 .
according to airbus this includes about $ 3.2 billion in tax breaks or incentives from washington state to persuade the american manufacturer to base its assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane there .
and eu officials were not mincing words on wednesday .
european union trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement that the us complaint was " obviously an attempt to divert attention from boeing 's self-inflicted decline , " .
he added if this was the path the us has chosen , he accepted the challenge - not least to end what he described as massive illegal us subsidies for boeing 's new 7e7 program , " he said .
lamy also hinted that the timing of the wto dispute was to coincide with the us presidential campaign from president george w bush who is facing criticism from his democratic challengers over the loss of us manufacturing jobs in recent years .
in 1992 the eu and the us agreed to a deal which limited subsidies for the world 's two largest airplane makers to 33 percent of the production costs for new models .
however as airbus increased it 's share of the airline market , chicago-based boeing expressed frustration that airbus has continued to get government money to help it develop especially as it became apparent that the french based manufacturer would develop a new plane known as the a380 to directly compete with boeings new 7e7 or dreamliner plane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu and us square up over airbus and boeing dw-world : bush mulls wto suit against airbus dw-world : airbus , boeing duel at air show picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

a us team added two genes from a sample of the 1918 virus to a modern strain known to have no effect on mice .
animals exposed to this composite were dying within days of symptoms similar to those found in human victims of the 1918 pandemic .
the research is published in the journal nature . "
the lesson is not to be complacent about anything to do with flu " professor john oxford the work of the us team , lead by dr yoshihiro kawaoka of the university of wisconsin , was carried out under the tightest security .
experts focused on two genes thought to play a key role in the infection process .
one controls production of a spike-like molecule called haemagglutinin -lrb- ha -rrb- , believed to be used by the flu virus to attach itself to the cells it is about to infect .
previous research published earlier this year in the journal science identified the ha gene as being the crucial element which made the 1918 virus so deadly - and the latest work appears to confirm this .
post mortems on mice injected in the nose with the composite virus showed that it had rampaged through their lungs , producing inflammation and haemorrhaging .
the researchers stress the experiment is conclusive for lab mice , and not humans .
better monitoring but they say that their work may lead to better ways to assess the potential danger of emerging flu viruses .
writing in nature , the researchers say : " once the properties of the -lrb- 1918 -rrb- ha gene that gave rise to its lethal infectivity are better understood , it should be possible to devise effective control measures and to improve global surveillance networks for influenza viruses that pose the greatest threat to humans as well as other animal species . "
scientists believe the 1918 virus leapt to humans by mutating from bird flu , possibly after passing through pigs , which are able to harbour both human and avian viruses and thus allow them to swap genes as the viruses reproduce .
for that reason , experts are deeply concerned that the avian flu that has broken out in poultry flocks in parts of south-east asia may acquire genes that will make it highly infectious as well as lethal for humans .
professor john oxford , an expert in virology at queen mary college london , told bbc news online the latest research underlined just what a threat all flu viruses potentially posed .
he said : " it is not a big difference at all between a virus that kills 15m people and one that does not kill anyone at all .
" the lesson is not to be complacent about anything to do with flu .
every flu virus must be carrying baggage that could potentially harm us , and we would be well advised not to ignore them . "
many deaths the 1918 " spanish " flu pandemic is estimated to have infected up to one billion people - half the world 's population at the time .
the virus killed more people than any other single outbreak of disease , surpassing even the black death of the middle ages .
although it probably originated in the far east , it was dubbed " spanish " flu because the press in spain - not being involved in world war i - were the first to report extensively on its impact .
the virus caused three waves of disease .
the second of these , between september and december 1918 , resulting in the heaviest loss of life .
it is thought that the virus may have played a role in ending world war i as soldiers were too sick to fight , and by that stage more men on both sides died of flu than were killed by weapons .
although most people who were infected with the virus recovered within a week following bed rest , some died within 24 hours of infection .

"
scientists believe the 1918 virus leapt to humans by mutating from bird flu , possibly after passing through pigs , which are able to harbour both human and avian viruses and thus allow them to swap genes as the viruses reproduce .
for that reason , experts are deeply concerned that the avian flu that has broken out in poultry flocks in parts of south-east asia may acquire genes that will make it highly infectious as well as lethal for humans .
professor john oxford , an expert in virology at queen mary college london , told bbc news online the latest research underlined just what a threat all flu viruses potentially posed .
he said : " it is not a big difference at all between a virus that kills 15m people and one that does not kill anyone at all .
" the lesson is not to be complacent about anything to do with flu .
every flu virus must be carrying baggage that could potentially harm us , and we would be well advised not to ignore them . "
many deaths the 1918 " spanish " flu pandemic is estimated to have infected up to one billion people - half the world 's population at the time .
the virus killed more people than any other single outbreak of disease , surpassing even the black death of the middle ages .
although it probably originated in the far east , it was dubbed " spanish " flu because the press in spain - not being involved in world war i - were the first to report extensively on its impact .
the virus caused three waves of disease .
the second of these , between september and december 1918 , resulting in the heaviest loss of life .
it is thought that the virus may have played a role in ending world war i as soldiers were too sick to fight , and by that stage more men on both sides died of flu than were killed by weapons .
although most people who were infected with the virus recovered within a week following bed rest , some died within 24 hours of infection .

a us team added two genes from a sample of the 1918 virus to a modern strain known to have no effect on mice .
animals exposed to this composite were dying within days of symptoms similar to those found in human victims of the 1918 pandemic .
the research is published in the journal nature .
the lesson is not to be complacent about anything to do with flu professor john oxford the work of the us team , lead by dr yoshihiro kawaoka of the university of wisconsin , was carried out under the tightest security .
experts focused on two genes thought to play a key role in the infection process .
one controls production of a spike-like molecule called haemagglutinin -lrb- ha -rrb- , believed to be used by the flu virus to attach itself to the cells it is about to infect .
previous research published earlier this year in the journal science identified the ha gene as being the crucial element which made the 1918 virus so deadly - and the latest work appears to confirm this .
post mortems on mice injected in the nose with the composite virus showed that it had rampaged through their lungs , producing inflammation and haemorrhaging .
the researchers stress the experiment is conclusive for lab mice , and not humans .

norwich city council thought it had driven out non-resident parkers from the streets around the university by introducing a controlled parking zone .
but the department of transport has told the council the parking ban can not be enforced because they ordered yellow signs instead of regulation white .
the mistake could cost taxpayers thousands of pounds to put right .
it will also prolong the frustration of people living near the university who have already paid £ 16 for a parking disc allowing them to leave their cars outside their homes .
' sorry ' for mistake a council spokeswoman said 18 of the wrong coloured signs had been erected and would be replaced with the correctly coloured signs as soon as possible .
" we have made a mistake and are very sorry .
the incorrect colour signs were ordered .
they should have been white , but are yellow instead .
" replacement signs have been re-ordered and should be up in the next few weeks .
unfortunately , under traffic regulations , signs must be correct to be enforceable - this includes colour .
" we apologise for any inconvenience caused and will be considering what to do for those residents who have already applied for permits and will be writing to those affected . "

i was told i had to choose between david morgan and the bbc " michael aspel former this is your life presenter aspel visited david morgan while in cardiff filming an edition of antiques roadshow at city hall .
the 71-year-old broadcaster wandered around his old department and chatted to assistants on the shop floor where he worked for a year between march 1954 and march 1955 .
he said : " i worked in david morgan until they threw me out for taking too much time off for broadcasting .
" i 'd just finished national service and i took a job with a firm in london who made beds .
" they said they wanted me to go to cardiff to learn the retail trade at david morgan .
" it was n't what i wanted to do , but i had a very happy time . "
the young aspel began to follow his broadcasting ambition and landed a part in a children 's radio play at the bbc in cardiff that was to lead to a premature end to his retail career .

" i took part in the fifth episode of a children 's play i was in and my boss told me he did n't accept my resignation because i was fired .
" -lrb- it was -rrb- the end of a glorious career in the retail trade . "

david morgan linens manager , jonathan pearn , helped show aspel around his old department .
he said : " he was interested in the changes to his old stomping ground over the years .
" he said it looks different , but the atmosphere is the same - he still loves department stores . "
aspel 's visit to david morgan coincided with an exhibition the store has put on to celebrate its 125th anniversary .
the family-run store has traded in the hayes , in cardiff city centre , since 28 october , 1879 , when founder david morgan moved his business to the site from the rhymney valley .
the site will be transformed into homes and smaller shops after it closes .
until then , the exhibition on the store 's third floor will remind shoppers of 125 years of trade at the 170,000 sq ft site .
among the pictures on display is one of michael aspel taking part in production by the store 's own drama club .
current chairman richard morgan , the great grandson , of david morgan , said of the visit of the store 's most famous former shop assistant : " he -lrb- aspel -rrb- enjoyed looking at the exhibits from 125 years of the store .
" we were delighted to welcome him back to the store after 50 years , " he said .

charlotte wyatt weighed just one pound when she was born 11 months ago and has serious heart and lung problems .
her parents say everything possible should be done to keep her alive .
doctors at portsmouth hospitals nhs trust argue that she is in almost constant pain and unlikely ever to enjoy a tolerable life .
oxygen supply darren , 32 , and debbie , 23 , believe that , as she has survived this far , charlotte must be given every assistance to help her live .
but doctors say charlotte , who has been in hospital since her birth , will not survive beyond infancy because her lungs are so severely damaged .
charlotte was born when her mother was 26 weeks pregnant and is fed through a tube as she can not suck from a bottle .
she also needs a constant supply of oxygen .
it has all been very difficult for us debbie wyatt , charlotte 's mother the dilemma doctors face over denying treatment last week , charlotte 's father darren wyatt , 33 , made an emotional plea to the judge not to allow the doctors to let her die .
he said : " when you get to the stage when you grow to love someone , you ca n't just throw them away like a bad egg and say you will get a different egg . "
good relationship mr wyatt conceded that he would have to change his mind if the time came when the baby was really suffering .
" but i believe there are things in medical science to help her carry on , even for a couple of years , and she can even go outside and see the trees and whatever , " he said .
earlier this week , david lock , counsel for the hospital , part of the portsmouth hospitals nhs trust , told the court a doctor had said she was " living in a plastic box " and that her life would be " dominated by pain and suffering " .
mr lock summarised the trust consultants ' findings by saying : " they are of the view that charlotte has life-limiting conditions and that , despite their best efforts , she has no feelings other than continuing pain . "
at a preliminary hearing , the parents stressed that they maintained a good relationship with the trust , even though they disagreed with its view that charlotte should not be ventilated if she needed it .

this jamie reid poster is among the exhibits the infamous art and fashions that surrounded the rise of influential punk group the sex pistols are displayed in an exhibition opening on thursday .
items of clothing and publicity posters that set out to shock the nation in the late 1970s are included alongside handwritten lyrics and concert flyers .
the best known pieces include graphic artist jamie reid 's doctored portrait of the queen with a safety pin through her mouth , and the now-iconic " destroy " punk t-shirts designed by vivienne westwood .
vivienne westwood 's original destroy t-shirts are highly prized there are also posters taken from the wall of pistols bass player sid vicious when he lived at the chelsea hotel in new york with girlfriend nancy spungen .
one , showing the cover of the band 's never mind the bollocks album , has bloodstains said to be from the couple 's use of heroin needles .
vicious was accused of murdering spungen in the hotel room , and died of a drugs overdose before he could be tried .
the exhibition also contains several notorious pornographic t-shirt designs which led to police raids on westwood and her partner malcolm mclaren 's boutique , sex , in king 's road , chelsea .
anarchy in the uk sex pistols founded in 1975 around malcolm mclaren and vivienne westwood 's shop , sex , in chelsea , west london mclaren , westwood and co-conspirator jamie reid sought to change the cultural landscape using art , music , fashion and design as the band 's manager , mclaren was credited with manipulating the media and helping the pistols change the face of uk music people wearing them in the street were threatened with arrest , and some of the more explicit designs retain the power to shock nearly 30 years on .
with the passage of time and the emergence of a more liberal society in the uk , it is difficult now to imagine just how threatening the sex pistols appeared to some in the more conservative moral climate of 1977 .
former art school student jamie reid 's reworking of a cecil beaton portrait of the queen - obscuring her eyes and mouth with " ransom " lettering - was viewed as practically treasonable in some quarters .
jamie reid 's graphic art was influential on the look of punk today , sexually explicit pictures and swearing are taken for granted as part and parcel of pop culture - but in the queen 's silver jubilee year a record shop owner faced prosecution for obscenity for displaying the " bollocks " lp .
all of the items on show , from band manager mclaren 's first typed press release to westwood 's world-famous bondage clothes , are co-owned by art lovers and collectors paul stolper and andrew wilson .
they were bought at auction from 1990 onwards at prices that began in the low hundreds of pounds and have since risen ten-fold .
a rare early pistols poster recently went for £ 4,000 .
the sex pistols were one of the uk 's most influential bands but mr stolper , who runs a london art gallery , told bbc news online : " this is n't about the value , although of course it has a value .
" there are no signatures or records ; this is not memorabilia .
it 's the clothing , the styling , the sloganeering that within two years turned everything upside down .
" today we have assimilated fashion , art and design and we now know when someone is trying to be outrageous .
back then , you could get arrested for this stuff . "
looking around at the mohair jumpers behind glass cases - and a god save the queen muslin shirt once owned by media figure janet street porter - the pistols ' clarion cry of rejection , no future , seems strangely at odds with the whitewashed gallery walls .
punk : a true and dirty tale is at the hospital gallery , endell street , london wc2 until 23 january .

but hitoshi miura , director of finance at semiconductor process equipment maker asm japan , says people need to look beyond the meeting rooms to see the japanese at work .
" when i talk to the bankers in the meeting rooms almost 90 % are talking about golf or playing golf , " says mr miura .
" in the last 10 minutes you have some indication whether things are good or bad , affirmative or negative .
business discussion is usually done during the playing of golf - on the tee or on the green . "
worries about widespread inefficiency in japan have led to numerous calls from opposition politicians for change .
even the prime minister , junichiro koizumi , often speaks of the need for reform .
but with japan 's economy now growing at its fastest pace for nearly fifteen years , most companies lack the motivation to scrap a business philosophy which has brought harmony and wealth to their society for decades .
