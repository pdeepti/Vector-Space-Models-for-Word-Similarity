nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .

called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .

orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .

the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .

comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .
2001 .
the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .

" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .

while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .
" i think the british are more into it , you know with the fascination with the whole world war stuff - an english music store in surrey stocked records of charlie and his orchestra in the 1980s and german label bmg promptly imported it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links charlie and his orchestra propaganda swing bob hertwig 's music store with information on goebbel 's band -lrb- in german only -rrb- feedback had you heard about " charlie and his orchestra " and the fact that the nazi regime used jazz and swing for propaganda purposes ?

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .

you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .

while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .

they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .

orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .

some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .
it 's the first exhibition of dresden art in the u.s. in a quarter century . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .

some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .
it 's the first exhibition of dresden art in the u.s. in a quarter century . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .
what is a comet ?
what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .
" but the fax machine has been going non stop .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .

it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .

it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .

but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.02.2004 swinging for goebbels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mr churchill , you never can win this war . "
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .
" i think the british are more into it , you know with the fascination with the whole world war stuff - an english music store in surrey stocked records of charlie and his orchestra in the 1980s and german label bmg promptly imported it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links charlie and his orchestra propaganda swing bob hertwig 's music store with information on goebbel 's band -lrb- in german only -rrb- feedback had you heard about " charlie and his orchestra " and the fact that the nazi regime used jazz and swing for propaganda purposes ?

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .

orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .
" i think the british are more into it , you know with the fascination with the whole world war stuff - an english music store in surrey stocked records of charlie and his orchestra in the 1980s and german label bmg promptly imported it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links charlie and his orchestra propaganda swing bob hertwig 's music store with information on goebbel 's band -lrb- in german only -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .
" i think the british are more into it , you know with the fascination with the whole world war stuff - an english music store in surrey stocked records of charlie and his orchestra in the 1980s and german label bmg promptly imported it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links charlie and his orchestra propaganda swing bob hertwig 's music store with information on goebbel 's band -lrb- in german only -rrb- 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .

the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.02.2004 let 's buy a nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that china could use the hanau plant to produce material for nuclear weapons .
a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .
" but the fax machine has been going non stop .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .
2001 .
the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .
" but the fax machine has been going non stop .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .
" the british are more into this stuff " though the story of the historic nazi propaganda jazz group has been the subject of books , films and documentaries , it 's their music in the form of records and cds that remains much sought-after .
the recent appearance in germany of 20 rare tracks by charlie and his orchestra , recorded between 1940 and 1948 , has rekindled attention in the little-known chapter of the nazi era - at least in terms of the press .
but bob hertwig , who runs a one-man mail order music store in hamburg , said the cds had attracted " microscopic attention " among the buying public so far .
" hardly anyone is interested in old music anymore .
it 's a shame because it 's well-made music .
it 's just a couple of old fogies who come by to hear it , " hertwig told dw-world .
" i think the british are more into it , you know with the fascination with the whole world war stuff - an english music store in surrey stocked records of charlie and his orchestra in the 1980s and german label bmg promptly imported it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links charlie and his orchestra propaganda swing bob hertwig 's music store with information on goebbel 's band -lrb- in german only -rrb- feedback had you heard about " charlie and his orchestra " and the fact that the nazi regime used jazz and swing for propaganda purposes ?

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?

they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .

is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .
many of the band 's hits like you 're driving me crazy and slumming on park avenue -lrb- let 's go bombing … -rrb- lampooned british premier winston churchill and painted him as a visionless old man , who hid in the cellar in the night to protect himself from mean german bombers .
the famous track little sir echo : poor mr. churchill , how do you do ?
hello , hello , your famous convoy are not coming through hello german u boats are making you sore … .
you 're always licked , not a victory came through , hello … you 're nice little fellow , but by now you should now that you never can win this war .
orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .
broadcasting continued until april 1945 .
when the americans marched into stuttgart , they were so impressed by charlie and his orchestra that they promptly commissioned some of the members to regularly play for them .
but the end of the third reich also spelled the death knell for the band - the musicians never played under the name charlie and his orchestra again .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .
crvenkovski 's government , which has already passed a raft of reforms to improve the situation of its ethnic albanian minority , also launched an intense diplomatic offensive in recent months aimed at preparing the ground for eventual membership . mixed reaction from brussels high-ranking macedonian delegations have been visiting berlin , paris and brussels .
but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .
2001 .
the eu-sponsored agreement ended a seven-month guerrilla uprising by enhancing the legal and political status of ethnic albanians while preserving the unitary character of the state . eu officials have also pinpointed the country 's appalling corruption levels , organized crime , drugs trade , money-laundering and an inefficient justice system as further problem areas . in addition , macedonia is one of europe 's poorest countries with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent and foreign investment in 2003 totaling only some € 50 million -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for the " european jigsaw 's missing piece " following an intense debate about a new draft constitution , eu leaders on saturday shifted to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans - five states which hope to join the eu in the next years .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

rosetta approaches the churyumov-gerasimenko comet did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?
european scientists are sending up an unmanned spacecraft with a miniature laboratory to try and find out .
they may have the answer in 2014 . the countdown has started for the first ever mission to land a space craft on a comet - after an original launch scheduled for thursday morning , it has now been postponed for a day .
but scientists eagerly following the take-off from the launch pad in kourous , french guiana , will have a much longer time to wait before they can begin their experiments on the comet 's surface : touchdown is n't due until november 2014 .
with ten years in the making and a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- invested in it , the unmanned orbiter rosetta is without a doubt the most ambitious and costly exploration of a comet , the fiery galactic rocks some scientists believe brought life to earth .
for the european space agency it is a chance to make history and add another piece to the giant puzzle of life 's origins .
" this is going to be the ultimate cometary mission , " declared esa 's director of science , david southwood .
" it will underpin cometary science for the next decades . "
and indeed it should , considering it will take at least 10 years before the orbiter actually arrives at its destination , the comet churyumov-gerasimenko , measured at 675 million kilometers -lrb- 421 million miles -rrb- from earth .
once it fires its thrusters and closes in on the target , though , scientists hope it will help unlock some of the secrets of the solar system , much as its namesake the rosetta stone lifted the veil on egyptian hieroglyphs .
setting up lab to aid in uncovering the mystery , rosetta will dispatch a tiny robot lab , philae -lrb- named after an obelisk that contained a final clue to the rosetta stone -rrb- , to gently land on the surface of " c-g . "
but because gravity is so low on comets , philae will fire a small tethered harpoon into the rock 's surface to anchor itself and then drill down a few centimeters for a good hold .
" landing is not so much of a problem , " said eduard müller from the german aerospace centre -lrb- dlr -rrb- in cologne , which is managing the landing phase of the esa mission .
" the real difficulty is keeping the lab on the surface once it 's there , " he told dw-world .
if that succeeds , philae will put its arsenal of instruments to work to analyze the chemical , mineralogical and radioactive composition of the comet 's surface .
it will relay the data back to the rosetta orbiter , which in turn will transmit the information back to the control center in europe .
instructions from earth to rosetta take up to fifty minutes to reach their destination , even at the speed of light , so the orbiter is equipped with " smart computers " and the " intelligence " to look after itself .
no room for error bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to catch a comet , rosetta is mounted on to ariane v rocket in korou , french guiana in the course of its journey to chruyumov-gerasimenko - named after the soviet astronomers credited with its discovery - rosetta and philae will circle the sun four times .
the craft will need three close fly-bys of earth and one of mars in order to pick up speed , using the planetary gravitational pull as a " slingshot " to reach more than 100,000 kph -lrb- 60,000 mph -rrb- and catch up with the comet .
by may or june of 2014 , rosetta will enter orbit around the comet and begin edging towards its target .
cameras mounted on the craft will map c-g in detail to assist scientists in selecting a suitable landing site on the barely four-kilometer surface -lrb- 2.5 miles across -rrb- .
the minutest error in navigation will send the pair hurtling out of the solar system .
unlocking the key to life ?
it 's a ten-year risk in the making , but if it succeeds , the mission could provide answers to how life began on earth .
comets are the most primitive material left after the making of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely touched by gravity and heat and are light in weight for their size .
some scientists believe they may contain volatile and complex carbon molecules .
it is these molecules that may have helped seed life on earth , according to the " panspermia " theory , which suggests the earth , while still in its infancy , was bombarded with comets and asteroids .
elements from these bodies could have reacted with the oceans to provide the building blocks for dna .
jean-pierre bibring of france 's national centre for space studies told reporters the " mission has the potential to make spectacular discoveries about the origin of earth and , perhaps , about the origin of life itself . "
not as difficult as a mars mission it will be ten and half years before rosetta and philae report back with their findings , and as esa knows from past missions , much can go wrong in the meantime despite the best of planning .
at dlr and esa , scientists and engineers understand they are in it for the long haul .
for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .
" it has it own particular challenges such as the length of the mission , and the swing-bys , " müller admitted , " but it wo n't be nearly as difficult as landing on mars .

for müller , the next decade is not just a time to twiddle fingers and wait until the comet comes into view .
" there are corrections to the trajectory every time the orbiter does a " swing-by " to gain speed , " he explained .
" we also have plans to take a closer look at the asteroid belt . "
although recent unmanned flights to mars , such as esa 's attempt to land its beagle 2 probe on the red planet in january , have had their problems , müller said he was confident the rosetta would succeed .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .
" they 're running the gamut , from € 10 to € 500 , " she said .

what are the fiery streaks of light made of , how big are they and where do they come from ?
as europe 's rosetta orbiter prepares for a rendezvous with a comet , dw-world sheds light on some of these questions . despite all the information scientists have gathered on comets in the last several years , the galactic rocks remain some of the most enigmatic pieces of the solar system .
because research so far rests on pictures and collected dust samples from fly-bys , scientists are still pretty much in the dark about the exact composition of comets , but a few things are fairly certain .
what is a comet ?
comets are small , dark icy bodies that orbit the sun and are believed to be almost pristine material left over from the creation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago .
they are barely influenced by gravity , and despite their density are relatively light in weight .
in 1949 u.s. astronomer fred whipple proposed that comets were made of ices and dust , and referred to them as " dirty snowballs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comet ikeya-zhang seen on march 10 , 2002 in kelly , n.c. the comet may have also appeared 341 years ago .
why do comets leave fiery trails ?
as a comet nears the sun , some of the ice melts and transforms into gouts of gas - the bright halo-like " coma " around its head .
the gassy wake and dust loosened by the melting ice create a spectacular tail that is reflected in the sun 's rays and may stretch across millions of kilometers in space .
incidentally , the word for comet comes from stella cometa , latin for " hairy star . "
how big is a comet ?
although the head of a comet can be bigger than a planet , most are just a few cubic kilometers in size .
the famous halley 's comet , for instance , is only about 15 km long by 4 km wide -lrb- 9 x 2.5 miles -rrb- .
where do they come from ?
most scientists say they are created at two locations on the fringes of the solar system .
long-period comets - those which take at least 200 years to return - are thought to originate in the oort cloud , an accumulation of gas and debris beyond the orbit of pluto .
short period comets are believed to come from a ring of debris beyond neptune 's orbit called the kuiper belt .
the theory says that the debris clusters together and is pushed into orbit by the gravitational effects of passing stars .
how many comets are known to exist ?
approximately 2,000 comets have been observed and recorded over the past 2,500 years .
even the ancient greeks and romans were fascinated by comets and described their appearance in great detail .
the first-century astronomer and astrologer ptolemy attributed great significance to the streaks of light : " the celestial phenomena called comets -lsb- cause -rsb- wars , heated and turbulent dispositions in the atmosphere , and in the constitutions of men . "
the birth of jesus and napoleon , the eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompei in ad79 and the great plague of 1665 have all been linked with comets .
how often do comets appear ?
the return time of comets varies .
they follow elliptical orbits ranging from a few years to as much as 40,000 years .
hyakutake , a comet that was visible from earth in 1996 , returns every 10,000 years or so .
the most famous comet , named after british astronomer edmond halley , reappears every 75 years .
the last time halley 's comet was visible from earth was 1986 .
the return time of comets can change slightly when they orbit the sun .
because they shed some of their mass through solar heating their path and revolution is effected .
what is special about the rosetta comet ?
comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko , or c-g for short , is the official name for rosetta 's target in 2014 .
it orbits the sun once every 6.6. years , but despite the relatively frequent fly-by , vvery little is known about it .
in deep space , its faint image is often veiled by light from background stars , and during its passage through the inner solar system , the glare of its coma obscures its nucleus .
it is believed to be about four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- across .
it is named after two soviet astronomers , klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko , who first identified it in 1969 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosetta was scheduled to meet up with the comet wirtanen , before the original 2003 launch date was postponed and a new target was selected .
why are comets so interesting for scientists ?
many astronomers subscribe to the " panspermia " theory which says that comets ' volatile and complex carbon molecules may have helped seed life on earth when they bombarded the planet during its infancy .
elements from these galactic bodies could have set off a chain reaction that created the building blocks for life , scientists believe .
many are hoping a close analysis of comets ' material composition will provide answers to how life on earth began .
can a comet hit earth ?
theoretically comets can pose a risk to life on earth .
a collision by a comet or large asteroid 65 million years ago is most likely to blame for the ice age and the extinction of dinosaurs .
in 1992 , the comet shoemaker-levy 9 was torn into 21 large fragments as it entered jupiter 's gravitational filed .
in july 1994 , the fragments smashed into the planet at speeds of about 210,000 kph -lrb- 130,000 mph -rrb- , releasing so much energy that they triggered fireballs larger than the earth . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans still hope to catch a comet high winds postponed the launch of the rosetta orbiter until friday , but scientists are still optimistic of succeeding in the unprecedented attempt to land a spacecraft on a comet .

a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china . " let 's buy hanau ourselves , " is the name of the initiative sponsored by the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- that got kicked off on thursday .
the goal is simple , if ambitious - raise € 50 million plus one euro to buy the hanau fuel element factory owned by siemens and prevent the factory from going to china , which wants to buy it for € 50 million .
" china could use the plant to create nuclear weapons , and we want to prevent that , " ute watermann , spokesperson for ippnw and the hanau campaign , told dw-world .
the plan to sell the hanau plant to china came to light in december , after a trip there by chancellor gerhard schröder .
while the german government is phasing out nuclear energy at home , it said it would likely approve the sale of the factory - which was completed in 1991 but never went into operation - unless concerns about china using the factory for military ends could not be eliminated .
the hanau plant itself does not contain a nuclear reactor , rather it enables the production of fuel for nuclear power plants .
still , nuclear energy opponents are outraged at the plan , saying even if china uses the plant for civilian energy production , a by-product of the process is weapons-grade plutonium .
" it 's an unbelievably dangerous technology , " watermann said .
" there is no purely civilian use for such a plant .
the ruling coalition will decide over the next few weeks if china fulfils the conditions for the sale .
according to gernot erler , social democrat parliamentary group leader , the government is confident that china will pass the test and the sale will go ahead .
star power the citizens group has gotten several german celebrities from the worlds of theater and television on board to lend the cause visibility and a little star power .
" one should n't go along with the duplicity of the government , " said peter sodann , one of the regulars om the popular television series " tatort " and a supporter of the initiative " with one hand we 're getting out of nuclear energy , with the other hand we 're selling -lsb- nuclear technology -rsb- to china . "
author erich loest , also lending his name to the campaign , said whatever guarantees china may have given to the german government about its planned uses for the plant , " we do n't know what china will actually do with it . "
other high-profile names from the worlds of art and entertainment include cabaret star martin buchholz , the comedy duo badesalz and songwriter konstantin wecker .
left-leaning german politicians have joined in the effort as well , including some members of schröder 's own social democrats .
spd parliamentarian and winner of the alternative nobel prize , hermann scheer , has been outspoken about the proposed sale , saying the nuclear trade needs to be stopped .
" the government needs to live up to its responsibilities , " he said .
pie in the sky ?
ute watermann admits that the goal of € 50 million is a difficult one , especially since the group is giving themselves just three to four weeks to raise it .
" it would be a dream if we did get there , " she said .
" but the real goal is to show the government that the public wants the sale to be stopped . "
supporters who want to contribute are not asked to send money or give credit card numbers , rather they fax in a form on which they promise to contribute a certain amount of money in case the € 50 million goal is reached and the purchase can go ahead .
she said the response up to now has been large , even though she could not cite an average sum being pledged .

macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .
his death has led skopje to put on hold its eu membership application scheduled to be presented on thursday . 47-year-old macedonian president boris trajkovski was killed on thursday morning when a plane carrying him to an international investment conference in the western bosnian city of mostar crashed in a mountainous part of southern bosnia .
police officials have said there was heavy rain and fog at the time of the crash .
there were no survivors . trajkovski , elected president in 1999 , studied theology in the u.s. a strong pro-eu proponent , he was viewed in the west as a young leader with an international outlook and considerable diplomatic skills . trajkovski was respected in macedonia for his neutral stance in the former yugoslav republic , which has seen tensions between macedonians and the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
he presided over a nato-brokered peace deal in 2001 that ended months of armed clashes . sights trained on europe trajkovski 's sudden death led to the cancellation of a delegation led by prime minister branko crvenkovski , scheduled to submit a formal european union membership application on thursday to irish president bertie ahern , who currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency . ahern described trajkovski as having " contributed hugely to reconciliation in macedonia " and a strong supporter of macedonia 's ambition to become an eu member .
" today should have been one of celebration for him , " ahern said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonian flag the tiny balkan country of 2 million is largely in favor of joining the eu , with some 87 percent of macedonians as well as most political parties supporting the membership bid .

but so far , the reception has been mixed .
while paris has clearly expressed support for the membership bid , berlin has been more muted .
the reaction from brussels has been split . macedonia has long been cited by the eu as a model of inter-ethnic harmony in the balkans , which has been plagued by ethnic tensions since the war in the 1990s following the break-up of the former yugoslavia .
javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , this month praised the country for its " impressive " recovery . but many eu officials still have reservations over the country 's progress .
while it 's generally agreed that macedonia , which along with croatia signed the eu 's stabilization and association agreement in april 2001 as the first step towards membership , should have a european perspective , some believe the timing may not be right . eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen said in an interview with deutsche welle that europe needed time - considering it was about to take in 10 new members in may as well as preparing for the planned membership for romania and bulgaria in 2007 . german european parliament member doris pack was more frank .
she said macedonia 's application came at a time when " many things in the eu were up for a fundamental change . "
pack told the deutsche welle that nobody would really get involved in the macedonian question and added it would be better if the government in skopje waited until next year and focused on fulfilling their reform commitments . improvement needed on all fronts the general view in the eu is that macedonia still has a long way to go before it 's called for accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake ohrid as a first step , skopje needs to fully implement the lake ohrid peace deal signed in aug .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .

nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to the u.s. on thursday .
for the first time in more than two years , he 'll be back at the white house .
is the rift over iraq a thing of the past ? on thursday morning - slightly delayed by plane troubles - german chancellor gerhard schröder left for a two-day trip to america .
but once he arrives in the u.s. , he 'll waste no time getting down to business . schröder 's first stop is chicago , where he will give a speech in front of the council on foreign relations on thursday evening .
the next day , he 'll go to washington , where u.s. president george w. bush will host him at the white house - schröder 's first official visit in more than two years .
since adamantly opposing the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , the german leader 's name has not been at the top of the guest list . for the two leaders with opposing positions on iraq , schröder 's reception at the white house may represent a significant warming of relations .
but with contentious issues on the agenda - iraq reconstruction , the strong euro and trans-atlantic trade - there 's still much that may divide the two . setting the tone in chicago in chicago , schröder 's remarks will set the tone for the visit ahead , outlining positions on many issues , including trade policies and the strong euro . the chancellor is expected to lobby hard for free international trade , touching on the recent protectionist policies of the u.s. , namely steel tariffs , which almost led to a full-fledged trade row between the united states and europe .
the chancellor will call for an end to export subsidies . " the answer to the challenges of a global market can not be more protectionism in order to protect ourselves from the negative consequences , " the chancellor will say , according to an early draft version of the speech .
" instead we must double and triple our efforts to maintain and improve our advantages . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few euro coins for a dollar .
in an interview with the financial times before his departure , schröder also outlined his position on the strong euro , which will also be a main topic of conversation between the two leaders on friday . increasingly , schröder has appealed to the european central bank to act and reduce the affects of the strong common currency , but will he ask his u.s. counterpart to do the same ?
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " he told the newspaper .
" only the central banks are in a position to change that , and i do not want to interfere in the policies of the u.s. federal reserve - that is a matter for the americans . " tensions a thing of the past ? at the white house , trade and currency issues will be on the agenda , as will the ongoing situation in iraq .
however , also in the financial times interview , schröder made clear that his position on the issue of german troops in iraq had not changed . " the american government knows precisely where we stand , " he said . that does n't mean the two leaders wo n't have much to discuss .
germany has offered to help with iraq 's debt relief as well as train policemen .
bush and schröder will be looking for more areas of cooperation .
the possibility of sending nato troops to iraq , however , remains a sticking point , as the german government prefers that a legitimate iraqi government and a un mandate be in place before they are deployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house will all the smiles , handshakes and talk of bygones at the white house really amount to a significant shift in u.s.-germans relations ?
not necessarily , say some observers .
they suggest that bush - in an election year - is reaching out to leaders of " old europe " in an attempt to deflect criticism from his opponents that his unilateral policies have alienated key allies . this is not the start of a great love affair , but a strategic partnership , stephen silvia , a political scientist at american university , told the german radio station ndr .
" the relationship between the two is not exactly warm , but businesslike , and , therefore , still somewhat clinical , " he said . a glorious end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden's " golden rider " depicts saxonian king august the strong .
some of the art he collected will be on display in jackson .
schröder 's last stop will be jackson , mississippi , where he will attend the opening of the " glory of baroque dresden " exhibition .
the show focuses on the eastern german city 's art treasures such as paintings by rembrandt , vermeer , rubens and other old masters and meissen porcelain .
it 's the first exhibition of dresden art in the u.s. in a quarter century . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

"
nazi opposition to " degenerate " jazz and swing may be well known , but few know goebbels used the propaganda value of the music to target allied listeners via the airwaves with his band charlie and his orchestra . during the nazi era , an ominous knock on the door often meant the end of the party for germany 's teenagers who belonged to the so-called " swing generation " - those who grew their hair long , listened to american swing and big band jazz and rebelled against the martial drills of hitler 's youth league .
the nazis , who frowned upon jazz as " impure " and " degenerate " on account of its african-american roots promptly banned the music when hitler came to power in 1933 .
the führer 's lieutenants routinely busted parties and hauled away defiant teenagers and musicians to concentration camps for listening to the " decadent " records .
nazi propaganda with oomph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joseph goebbels , german minister of propaganda but not everyone who dared to listen to benny goodman and swing bands had to fear such a dreadful fate .
some like saxophonist lutz templin actually received covert encouragement to listen to the latest hits by american swing orchestras and take copious notes .
the orders came from none other than joseph goebbels -lrb- photo -rrb- , hitler 's much-feared propaganda minister .
shortly after hitler 's ascension to power , goebbels took over the german airwaves and broadcast nazi propaganda texts throughout the world via short-wave .
recognizing the enormous influence of radio and music , the crafty minister called for the creation of his own swing band in 1940 .
he figured that while music at the home front had to conform to the traditionalist tastes of hitler and the nazi elite , a bit of oomph was needed for propaganda aimed at foreign countries .
founded by templin and fronted by crooner karl -lrb- " charlie " -rrb- schwedler , the orchestra formed a crucial spoke in the wheel of the massive nazi propaganda machine .
called " charlie and his orchestra , " the band combined hit-parade savvy with pro-nazi , anti-semitic lyrics in english , which were broadcast into the living rooms of america , england and other " enemy " countries .
bringing some pizzazz in german broadcasting " charlie , " who spoke perfect english , carefully listened to the latest american hits from broadway productions , jazz classics and hollywood films , rewrote the lyrics and repacked them with subversive pro-nazi propaganda .
the band served up cover versions of the latest swing sensations and boosted german foreign broadcasting with much musical sizzle and hipster allure .

orchestra relies on foreigners because many of germany 's greatest jazz musicians were jews and were deported to concentration camps , templin had to recruit several musicians from countries occupied by germany .
the result was an orchestra that included some of europe 's finest jazz musicians like drummer freddie brocksieper and a host of temporary musicians from belgium and holland .
the band members enjoyed special privileges - they were exempted form military service and were paid 16 deutschmarks every morning .
in time , " charlie and his orchestra " gained a strong following abroad and , more clandestinely , within germany itself .
near the end of world war ii the orchestra moved to stuttgart from berlin due to the heavy bombings .

a report by the us group conservation international says leatherback numbers there have fallen by 97 % in 22 years .
five of the six other species of sea turtle are also at risk of extinction , though not necessarily as acutely .
threats include fishing practices and the poaching of the turtles ' eggs , but scientists say they can still be saved .
one in three dies ci released its report on the plight of the pacific leatherbacks at the 24th annual symposium on sea turtle conservation and biology , meeting in costa rica .
it says their numbers have fallen from about 115,000 breeding females to fewer than 3,000 since 1982 .
james spotila , professor of environmental science at drexel university , said : " the pacific leatherbacks currently face an annual mortality rate of up to 30 % .
" that rate is clearly unsustainable , and without dramatic intervention we can expect to see them disappear in as soon as a decade . "
of the other species , the kemp 's ridley and hawksbill turtles are also both classified by iucn-the world conservation union as critically endangered , the designation given to the leatherbacks .
green , olive ridley and loggerhead turtles are classed as endangered , and only northern australia 's flatbacks are not thought to face extinction .
roderic mast , vice-president of ci and president of the international sea turtle society , said : " on land , the canary in the coal mine warns humans of impending environmental danger .
" sea turtles act as our warning mechanism for the health of the ocean , and what they 're telling us is quite alarming .
their plummeting numbers are symptomatic of the ocean as a whole . "
one particular threat to turtles is the practice of longline fishing , which involves the use of lines up to 145km -lrb- 90 miles -rrb- long baited with as many as 8,000 hooks each .
scientists are urging a dual approach to saving the turtles : better protection and management for their nesting beaches , and control of land-based lights : the turtles mistake them for the moon , walk towards them , and become stranded on the beach more marine protection and safer fishing techniques - less than 0.5 % of the oceans are formally protected , and inexpensive changes to fishing gear and practices could mean radical cuts in the mortality rate .
one promising development , ci says , is the investment of several million dollars over the next three years to consolidate a marine protected area stretching from ecuador to costa rica .
the money is coming from four latin american states , the united nations foundation , unesco , and ci itself .

the loggerheads predate the dinosaurs -lrb- image : alan f rees / archelon -rrb- it says their numbers have fallen from about 115,000 breeding females to fewer than 3,000 since 1982 .
james spotila , professor of environmental science at drexel university , said : " the pacific leatherbacks currently face an annual mortality rate of up to 30 % .
" that rate is clearly unsustainable , and without dramatic intervention we can expect to see them disappear in as soon as a decade . "
of the other species , the kemp 's ridley and hawksbill turtles are also both classified by iucn-the world conservation union as critically endangered , the designation given to the leatherbacks .

" sea turtles act as our warning mechanism for the health of the ocean , and what they 're telling us is quite alarming .

one particular threat to turtles is the practice of longline fishing , which involves the use of lines up to 145km -lrb- 90 miles -rrb- long baited with as many as 8,000 hooks each .
scientists are urging a dual approach to saving the turtles : better protection and management for their nesting beaches , and control of land-based lights : the turtles mistake them for the moon , walk towards them , and become stranded on the beach more marine protection and safer fishing techniques - less than 0.5 % of the oceans are formally protected , and inexpensive changes to fishing gear and practices could mean radical cuts in the mortality rate .
one promising development , ci says , is the investment of several million dollars over the next three years to consolidate a marine protected area stretching from ecuador to costa rica .
the money is coming from four latin american states , the united nations foundation , unesco , and ci itself .

speaking to the financial times he said the current dollar-euro exchange rate was " not satisfactory " for europe .
while saying he respected the ecb 's independence , he said he believed it would be looking at a possible change in interest rates .
mr schroeder made his comments ahead of talks with us president george w bush .
expensive exports they appeared to have an immediate effect on the currency markets , helping the euro fall against the dollar in early wednesday trading in the far east , where one euro was worth $ 1.2498 .
i can imagine ... there will be some consideration about whether -lsb- euro -rsb- interest rates are at the right level gerhard schroeder this compares with recent highs of above $ 1.29 .
the uk pound was trading at $ 1.8745 , just below recent levels .
" the dollar-euro exchange rate , at least for the europeans , is not satisfactory , " mr schroeder told the financial times .
" i would just say that i believe the european central bank has recognised that this relationship between the euro and the dollar is not helping the export sector , to put it very mildly .
french backing " i can imagine that as a result , with all due respect for the independence of the ecb , there will be some consideration about whether -lsb- euro -rsb- interest rates are at the right level . "
schroeder 's opinions were later backed up by french prime minsiter jean-pierre raffarin .
mr raffarin said he " shares the view " that the euroopean central bank should consider cutting interest rates .
the current excahnge rate between the dollar and the euro is " not good for either the us or europe , " raffarin said .

the photographs , being offered on 3 march at dominic winter book auctions , belong to the wife of a former daily telegraph journalist in essex .

in pictures : churchill the younger images include him campaigning for election in 1914 and visiting troops - and even one titled " an attempted molestation by a suffragette " in aberdeen in 1912 .
the album bears the gilt stamp " the right honourable winston churchill , chartwell manor , westerham " , which was churchill 's kent home , and it is thought it was given to him as a gift and then loaned out .
chris albury , who values documents for the auction house in swindon , said : " they 're like hens ' teeth .

aleck bochel , aged 82 , from nairn , had his appointments cut in half when the health authority phased out the treatment of low priority patients .
local msp mary scanlon said it was a sinister attempt to reduce waiting lists .
but nhs highland chief podiatrist mary macleod defended the move .
" we would rather be dealing with patients with major problems , diabetic issues and ulceration .
we also do acupuncture and insoles , " she said .
" these take time and the truth is , if we 're doing non-podiatry need - which is simple nail-cutting - we 're not doing that . "
" i thought the system was there to help get your nails repaired " aleck bochel mr bochel said he could not believe it when asked if he would consider getting his toenails removed .
the war veteran said : " i was shocked .
i went through the war and never had anything like that done to me .
" i thought the system was there to help get your nails repaired - i do n't think it 's an insurmountable job . "
mrs scanlon , a conservative list msp for highlands and islands , questioned the health trust 's policy .

dr marie murphy says our calorie intake has decreased over the last century , but we do less physical work and travel everywhere by vehicle .
dr murphy , a senior lecturer in exercise physiology , said lifestyles must change to tackle obesity .
she said most people should " exercise moderately " for 30-45 minutes a day .
dr murphy said that people become overweight or obese when there is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure .
" data from national food surveys suggest that our total daily energy intake has declined from the 1970s , " she said .
sedentary " the rise in obesity in our society is attributable , in part , to our low levels of physical activity , which reduce our energy needs . "
she pointed out that only 20 % of people are now employed in manual jobs ; watching television and using computers or videos are now the most popular leisure pursuits .
a large proportion of car journeys in northern ireland are under three miles in length , a distance commonly walked by our grandparents , dr murphy says .
she said children are much more sedentary because many parents prefer young children to be in the home rather than outside , because of a perception that the modern world is more dangerous .
the lecturer said moderate exercise did not have to be vigorous , but could include walking , gardening , taking the stairs , and active play with children .

it follows a review carried out between april and october 2003 by the commission for health improvement and the audit commission .
the report said waiting times for operations have come down and significant progress has been made in preventing , diagnosing and treating coronary heart disease .
but it also says access to services tends to vary , with people in north and east cornwall often having to wait longer than those in plymouth or south and west devon .
the review aimed to measure progress towards certain national standards set by the government which need to be met by 2010 .
it said some patients were waiting more than a year for an angiography , an x-ray examination of blood vessels , to see if they need treatment .
however , the south west peninsula health authority said those figures had already been brought down and the waiting time should be under nine months by march .
the authority also said there had also been progress in efforts to stop people smoking , to get them to exercise more and eat more healthily .
andy mckeon from the audit commission said : " this important review shows how well the local nhs is meeting the standards set by the government for care of heart disease in the plymouth area and how well extra money invested in the nhs is being spent . "

hundreds of protestors have opposed the budget , which shaved more than £ 1m from the city 's voluntary sector .
the city 's ruling liberal democrat and conservative alliance made only one £ 9,000 adjustment to the £ 350m budget at a meeting on wednesday evening .
leicestershire county council approved a 6.4 % tax rise at a separate meeting despite opposition from pensioners .
transition fund members of many organisations have spent the past few weeks vigorously campaigning against the city council cuts , but only a handful of voluntary groups were given a reprieve .
it has been a painful process , but a necessary process roger blackmore council leader during a four and a half hour meeting on wednesday , the alliance passed the budget despite opposition from the labour group on council .
deputy prime minister john prescott has warned local councils to submit percentage rises in " low single figures " or risk ministers using their budget " capping " powers .
some of the groups that face budget cuts in leicester include rape crisis , leicester charity link , the belgrave playgroup and soft touch .
the ruling coalition said cuts were necessary because of a £ 10m shortfall handed to it by the outgoing labour administration .
" it has been a painful process , but a necessary process , " said city council leader roger blackmore .
he said there will still be services for those who need them .
a transitional fund has been established so voluntary groups can get some discretionary money , he said .

it follows a similar study in the indian part of the sundarbans .
the census is part of an initiative to preserve the biodiversity of the forest , which lies on the border between the two countries .
early indications from india suggest that the tigers , previously thought to be dying out , are increasing in number .
fifty teams will spend the next week in the sundarbans to get the first accurate picture of the state of the royal bengal tiger population in bangladesh .
the big cats are elusive , making counting them by sight impossible .
instead the scientists will look for paw prints left in the mud of the mangrove forest .
like a human fingerprint , each animal 's pug mark is different .
uneasy relationship the indian census took place last month .
although the data has not been fully analysed , scientists say they found more cubs than they expected , an indication that the tiger 's numbers may be increasing .
the tigers exist in an uneasy relationship with the human inhabitants of the sundarbans .
every year , about 20 people fall victim to attacks while out in the forest .
in turn , tigers that stray too close to villages are regularly killed .
the full results of the tiger census are expected by july .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- kingsley never blase about oscars bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture thursday , 26 february , 2004 , 08:37 gmt kingsley never blase about oscars sir ben kingsley 's latest role as an iranian former soldier in the powerful drama house of sand and fog has once again put him in the limelight .
it may be his fourth oscar nomination , including a win for gandhi in 1983 , but sir ben said he never gets blase about it .
" i 'm absolutely astonished , " the british actor told bbc news 24 's hardtalk programme .
" i started as a young actor - so terrified that the one line in the shakespeare play was approaching that i practically passed out on stage .
" i never dreamt i would be nominated four times for the greatest acting award possible to receive .
it is thrilling . "
many of his peers have reputations for speaking out on public policy issues , including sean penn , martin sheen and susan sarandon , but sir ben said he did not feel obligated to make stands .
" i enjoy the debate amongst my friends , peers and colleagues but i do not enjoy the debate publicly in front of the camera , " he said . "
i see ' the child ' very much at the centre of this year 's work , and how tragic the loss of a child is " sir ben kingsley " it can be grossly misinterpreted and can backfire and ruin the cause i set out to help in the first place . "
house of sand and fog has been critically praised for its stirring performances and its strong messages .
culture clash in it sir ben plays former iranian colonel behrani who flees to the us but finds he can not provide such a palatial life for his family , and is forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet .
the story centres on a beach house from which its owner kathy , played by jennifer connelly , is mistakenly evicted , and which behrani buys in the hope of making money .
a bitter battle between the former and present owner ensues as their personalities and cultures clash , leading to a devastating outcome .
" i do not see him -lrb- behrani -rrb- as a tragic figure .
i see him as a father , as a breadwinner , " sir ben told the bbc .
" i see him as a warrior , as a man profoundly loyal to his culture , meeting head-on potentially tragic circumstances . "
the film is a difficult one to market because of its subtle yet tragic storyline , although the book , written by andre dubus iii , was a bestseller in the us after being lauded by oprah winfrey .
" i 'm somewhat ignorant as to whether or not it is a hard sell at the box office because i am at the receiving end of people who are very moved , full of praise and deeply touched , " said sir ben .
" and it seems to me that those responses are based upon how it reignites their love of life , their love of family , their love of their children .
people phone their sons as soon as they leave the cinema or wake up their children in bed as soon as they get home for a hug .
this is a wonderful response to our film . "
sir ben said he recognised a theme running through many of the oscar contenders .
discipline " i see ' the child ' very much at the centre of this year 's work , and how tragic the loss of a child is , in our film and in others .
" maybe we are becoming aware of the fact there are abused , terrified , abandoned and lost children in the world and we should heed their cries . "
aside from his regular oscar recognition , sir ben is one of britain 's most respected actors .
he said he was blessed by his early years in english theatre which taught him to hone his " technique " .
it is this discipline that he brings to the screen in the many powerful roles he has played in his films , including gandhi and schindler 's list .
he also credits his performance in house of sand and fog to his young novice co-star jonathan ahdout , who plays his teenage son .
and he said it is to the young actor 's credit that the two actors playing his parents have been nominated for oscars .
iranian actress shohreh aghdashloo has a best supporting nomination for playing his wife nadi .
tom brook interviews sir ben kingsley on bbc news 24 's hardtalk on monday , 23 february at 0430 and 2330 .

" in the end the best analysis i can come up with is that these people look at , not just me , but other people like me and they just do not get it , " said baldwin .
" they look at you and say ' you 're a middle-aged , rich , white guy why ca n't you just sit back and relax and enjoy it like we do , why ca n't you just hit 18 holes and go into the club house ... have a martini , and what do you care about what underprivileged people and gay people and black people .

it may be his fourth oscar nomination , including a win for gandhi in 1983 , but sir ben said he never gets blase about it .
" i 'm absolutely astonished , " the british actor told bbc news 24 's hardtalk programme .
" i started as a young actor - so terrified that the one line in the shakespeare play was approaching that i practically passed out on stage .
" i never dreamt i would be nominated four times for the greatest acting award possible to receive .
it is thrilling . "
many of his peers have reputations for speaking out on public policy issues , including sean penn , martin sheen and susan sarandon , but sir ben said he did not feel obligated to make stands .
" i enjoy the debate amongst my friends , peers and colleagues but i do not enjoy the debate publicly in front of the camera , " he said .
i see ' the child ' very much at the centre of this year 's work , and how tragic the loss of a child is sir ben kingsley " it can be grossly misinterpreted and can backfire and ruin the cause i set out to help in the first place . "
house of sand and fog has been critically praised for its stirring performances and its strong messages .
culture clash in it sir ben plays former iranian colonel behrani who flees to the us but finds he can not provide such a palatial life for his family , and is forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet .
the story centres on a beach house from which its owner kathy , played by jennifer connelly , is mistakenly evicted , and which behrani buys in the hope of making money .
a bitter battle between the former and present owner ensues as their personalities and cultures clash , leading to a devastating outcome .
" i do not see him -lrb- behrani -rrb- as a tragic figure .
i see him as a father , as a breadwinner , " sir ben told the bbc .
" i see him as a warrior , as a man profoundly loyal to his culture , meeting head-on potentially tragic circumstances . "
the film is a difficult one to market because of its subtle yet tragic storyline , although the book , written by andre dubus iii , was a bestseller in the us after being lauded by oprah winfrey .
" i 'm somewhat ignorant as to whether or not it is a hard sell at the box office because i am at the receiving end of people who are very moved , full of praise and deeply touched , " said sir ben .
" and it seems to me that those responses are based upon how it reignites their love of life , their love of family , their love of their children .
people phone their sons as soon as they leave the cinema or wake up their children in bed as soon as they get home for a hug .
this is a wonderful response to our film . "
house of sand and fog is a poweful drama about regret sir ben said he recognised a theme running through many of the oscar contenders .
discipline " i see ' the child ' very much at the centre of this year 's work , and how tragic the loss of a child is , in our film and in others .
" maybe we are becoming aware of the fact there are abused , terrified , abandoned and lost children in the world and we should heed their cries . "
aside from his regular oscar recognition , sir ben is one of britain 's most respected actors .
he said he was blessed by his early years in english theatre which taught him to hone his " technique " .
it is this discipline that he brings to the screen in the many powerful roles he has played in his films , including gandhi and schindler 's list .
he also credits his performance in house of sand and fog to his young novice co-star jonathan ahdout , who plays his teenage son .
and he said it is to the young actor 's credit that the two actors playing his parents have been nominated for oscars .

and no-one is more surprised than baldwin himself that he has finally caught the attention of voters playing a ruthless las vegas casino owner .
" i have never been someone that was in that universe before with nominations for films , " he told tom brook on bbc news 24 's hardtalk .
if i do not come out the other end of the premiere as the grooviest actor in hollywood ... well , that 's ok alec baldwin " i have been nominated for things in tv and theatre but never for the movies before . "
this will be his fifth time of attending the ceremony in las vegas , having presented awards and watched his former wife kim basinger collect an oscar in 1998 for la confidential .
" i do n't think i have ever come close .
i think with glengarry glen ross people would come up to me and say ' you are going to be nominated for an oscar ' , " he said .
" that did n't happen and i did n't really care because i think if you plot your career gunning for an oscar or doing a bit of oscar-hunting it can backfire for you as well .
bitter battle alec , 45 , is the eldest of four brothers who became actors - stephen , william and daniel .

the report drawn up for the conservatives by ex-bskyb and channel 5 executive david elstein recommended replacing the compulsory fee with a voluntary subscription to bbc services .
