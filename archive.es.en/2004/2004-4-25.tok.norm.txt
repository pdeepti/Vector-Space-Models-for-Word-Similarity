heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude 9798 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .

" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .
" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks . " portugal rocked by scandal the u.s. solution may not fit , but the sluggish economic growth underlines a problem . the portuguese economy seems unable to fully shed the shackles of the past and a reliance on a heavily-regulated , protected system . economic competition can only get tougher with ten eastern european countries slated to join the eu on may 1 . the portuguese legal system is notoriously slow , lacks transparency and has been perceived as unwilling to prosecute powerful people . the system is facing its first major test since the return to democracy . ten people , among them a man tipped as a future socialist party leader , two television presenters and a former portuguese ambassador , have all been indicted in connection with the sexual abuse of children from state-run homes . the abuse has been going on since the mid-1970s . " of course it symbolized something rotten in the system , we had the feeling that some people could not be touched by the system , " says zello . a mixed bag many argue for more political consensus on important issues . but at the moment , that 's unlikely . not least because the current centre right government is in coalition with a right wing party that journalist eduardo meshkeranyez compares to jorg haider 's freedom party in austria . thirty years after the end of an oppressive dictatorship , there 's a lot to celebrate , but there are still a few ghosts from the past to be exorcised . danny wood send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .

a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu . " our road will not be paved with roses … but we will not be deterred , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .

placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .

christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.04.2004 social democrat to become austria 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer comes out trumps .
heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .

" the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "

europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division .

the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .
" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks . " portugal rocked by scandal the u.s. solution may not fit , but the sluggish economic growth underlines a problem . the portuguese economy seems unable to fully shed the shackles of the past and a reliance on a heavily-regulated , protected system . economic competition can only get tougher with ten eastern european countries slated to join the eu on may 1 . the portuguese legal system is notoriously slow , lacks transparency and has been perceived as unwilling to prosecute powerful people . the system is facing its first major test since the return to democracy . ten people , among them a man tipped as a future socialist party leader , two television presenters and a former portuguese ambassador , have all been indicted in connection with the sexual abuse of children from state-run homes . the abuse has been going on since the mid-1970s . " of course it symbolized something rotten in the system , we had the feeling that some people could not be touched by the system , " says zello . a mixed bag many argue for more political consensus on important issues . but at the moment , that 's unlikely . not least because the current centre right government is in coalition with a right wing party that journalist eduardo meshkeranyez compares to jorg haider 's freedom party in austria . thirty years after the end of an oppressive dictatorship , there 's a lot to celebrate , but there are still a few ghosts from the past to be exorcised . danny wood send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu . " our road will not be paved with roses … but we will not be deterred , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals .

" fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .

amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu . " our road will not be paved with roses … but we will not be deterred , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .
-lrb- april 24 , 2004 -rrb- greek cypriot leader rejects peace plan in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month .
-lrb- april 8 , 2004 -rrb- verheugen feels ' cheated ' by greek cypriot government " i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " verheugen said in strasbourg .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you feel that cyprus has " missed a historic chance " as believed by the international community ?

fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .
" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks . " portugal rocked by scandal the u.s. solution may not fit , but the sluggish economic growth underlines a problem . the portuguese economy seems unable to fully shed the shackles of the past and a reliance on a heavily-regulated , protected system . economic competition can only get tougher with ten eastern european countries slated to join the eu on may 1 . the portuguese legal system is notoriously slow , lacks transparency and has been perceived as unwilling to prosecute powerful people . the system is facing its first major test since the return to democracy . ten people , among them a man tipped as a future socialist party leader , two television presenters and a former portuguese ambassador , have all been indicted in connection with the sexual abuse of children from state-run homes . the abuse has been going on since the mid-1970s . " of course it symbolized something rotten in the system , we had the feeling that some people could not be touched by the system , " says zello . a mixed bag many argue for more political consensus on important issues . but at the moment , that 's unlikely . not least because the current centre right government is in coalition with a right wing party that journalist eduardo meshkeranyez compares to jorg haider 's freedom party in austria . thirty years after the end of an oppressive dictatorship , there 's a lot to celebrate , but there are still a few ghosts from the past to be exorcised . danny wood send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.04.2004 social democrat to become austria 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer comes out trumps .
heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division .

the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu . " our road will not be paved with roses … but we will not be deterred , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .
-lrb- april 24 , 2004 -rrb- greek cypriot leader rejects peace plan in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .
" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks . " portugal rocked by scandal the u.s. solution may not fit , but the sluggish economic growth underlines a problem . the portuguese economy seems unable to fully shed the shackles of the past and a reliance on a heavily-regulated , protected system . economic competition can only get tougher with ten eastern european countries slated to join the eu on may 1 . the portuguese legal system is notoriously slow , lacks transparency and has been perceived as unwilling to prosecute powerful people . the system is facing its first major test since the return to democracy . ten people , among them a man tipped as a future socialist party leader , two television presenters and a former portuguese ambassador , have all been indicted in connection with the sexual abuse of children from state-run homes . the abuse has been going on since the mid-1970s . " of course it symbolized something rotten in the system , we had the feeling that some people could not be touched by the system , " says zello . a mixed bag many argue for more political consensus on important issues . but at the moment , that 's unlikely . not least because the current centre right government is in coalition with a right wing party that journalist eduardo meshkeranyez compares to jorg haider 's freedom party in austria . thirty years after the end of an oppressive dictatorship , there 's a lot to celebrate , but there are still a few ghosts from the past to be exorcised . danny wood send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .

by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .
coca cola and opposition political parties were banned . apart from the constant threat of imprisonment for speaking out against the regime , virtually every aspect of life was controlled .
a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .
" i think that the mentality of portuguese entrepreneurs should also change .
they do n't like risks . " portugal rocked by scandal the u.s. solution may not fit , but the sluggish economic growth underlines a problem . the portuguese economy seems unable to fully shed the shackles of the past and a reliance on a heavily-regulated , protected system . economic competition can only get tougher with ten eastern european countries slated to join the eu on may 1 . the portuguese legal system is notoriously slow , lacks transparency and has been perceived as unwilling to prosecute powerful people . the system is facing its first major test since the return to democracy . ten people , among them a man tipped as a future socialist party leader , two television presenters and a former portuguese ambassador , have all been indicted in connection with the sexual abuse of children from state-run homes . the abuse has been going on since the mid-1970s . " of course it symbolized something rotten in the system , we had the feeling that some people could not be touched by the system , " says zello . a mixed bag many argue for more political consensus on important issues . but at the moment , that 's unlikely . not least because the current centre right government is in coalition with a right wing party that journalist eduardo meshkeranyez compares to jorg haider 's freedom party in austria . thirty years after the end of an oppressive dictatorship , there 's a lot to celebrate , but there are still a few ghosts from the past to be exorcised . danny wood send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first .

world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry . leaders across the world expressed frustration and disappointment at the results of saturday 's referendum in cyprus , in which an overwhelming 76 percent of greek cypriots voted against a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan u.n. secretary-general and architect of the peace plan , kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said cyprus has " missed an historic opportunity to resolve 30 years of division . "
the island will remain " divided and militarized " as it joins the european union on may 1 , anan said . annan 's plan envisaged a federation of two politically equal states , one for the 643,000 greek cypriots and one for the 180,000 turks and turkish cypriots in the north , under a weak central government . the u.n. secretary-general , who was at the center of mediation efforts between the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots , however indicated he still had n't given up hope that a solution could be found .
a statement from annan 's office also said he hoped greek cypriots " may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time after a profound and sober assessment of today 's decision . " the u.n. reunification plan required agreement from both sides of the island .
but , despite european and american support , greek cypriots rejected it in large numbers and turkish cypriots heavily endorsed it .
as a result only the southern greek cypriot half of cyprus will join the eu on may 1 , enjoying eu laws and benefits . eu considers ways to help northern cyprus the european commission also reacted sharply to the rejection of the peace plan .
" a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement . it however praised turkish cypriots for their " yes " vote -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and said it would consider ways to promote economic development in the poorer turkish northern half amid fears that the region would slide into further isolation .
the turkish northern half of cyprus is only recognized by turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen " there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus ´ , " the eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . " experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
but others such as his prime minister mehment talat , a supporter of the plan , has called on the eu and un to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time . his calls are echoed by turkey .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul , said , " the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end . " disappointment across the world across , the world , leaders reacted with dejection and sadness at the outcome of the referendum . u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher said washington was " disappointed " by the greek cypriot vote , calling it a " setback " to those seeking a united cyprus . even british foreign minsiter jack straw said in london he hoped that the inhabitants of southern cyprus would once again reconsider " whether this vote is the right one for them . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu . " our road will not be paved with roses … but we will not be deterred , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .
-lrb- april 24 , 2004 -rrb- greek cypriot leader rejects peace plan in a fresh blow to the cyprus peace process , greek cypriot leader tassos papadopoulos has urged voters to reject a u.n. plan to reunify the island in a referendum later this month .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude 9797 dw-tv europe live popxport we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" experts believe that one way of doing that is to use the same funds that were earmarked for the turkish cypriot half in the eventuality that it would enter the eu . turkish cypriots warn against further isolation many turkish and turkish cypriot leaders have urged the eu to reverse the further isolation of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot supporters of the cyprus reunification plan hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the u.n. plan - has called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .

" german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was at a loss to understand that the citizens of southern cyprus had n't seized the " big chance " that the u.n. plan offered them . greek cypriots still interested in reunification the mood on the greek side was subdued after results of the referendum trickled in , with streets and cafes wearing a deserted look . cyprus , a former british colony , has been divided since 1974 ever since turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup in an attempt to unite the island with greece .
a mined no-man 's land , the " green line , " which is policed by u.n. peacekeepers , separates the northern one-third of the island from the south . the peace plan 's outcome was more or less sealed after prominent greek cypriot leaders said they were unhappy with the details that favored the turkish cypriots .
greek cypriot leaders in particular objected to the fact that the blueprint restricts the rights of an estimated 200,000 refugees to return to their former homes in the north , while allowing more than 60,000 settlers from turkey to remain on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos however on sunday , greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos -lrb- photo -rrb- - who has been accused of running a campaign playing on greek cypriot fears that turkey and the turkish cypriots would fail to hand back nine percent of the island 's territory and gradually withdraw 38,000 turkish troops - urged the turkish cypriots not to abandon efforts to reunite the island within the eu .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first .

his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

30 years ago portuguese army officers toppled the dictatorship of oliveira salazar in a bloodless coup known as the " revolution of the carnations . "
portugal is celebrating the anniversary with mixed feelings . during the days of portuguese dictator salazar , critics of the regime called fado , their national music , one of the three ' fs ' that helped keep the dictatorship in place . the other two : fatima , referred to the catholic hierarchy , an ally of the regime , and football , a pleasant distraction that kept people 's minds off their poverty and stifling oppression . dr. oliveira salazar , died in 1970 , but his regime staggered on in the face of widespread protests from students , workers and an army fed up with a decade of colonial wars in africa . mario vierez cervarllo , deputy vice chancellor of new university , lisbon remembers his teenage days organizing the printing of the anti-salazar newspaper , republica . " it -lrb- the revolution of 1974 -rrb- was the most important event of my life , " cervarllo says . turbulent times since the 1950s , a protest movement in portugal was gathering speed under the guise of cultural activities at universities .
by the 1970s , even most of the army was backing the growing movement against the dictatorship . " the military forces were the first to see that the situation was not sustainable , " cervarllo remembers . in 1974 , portugal was still sending young men to their deaths in africa , to defend its colonies .
eduardo meshkeranyez , a senior reporter with diario de noticias , one of portugal 's daily newspapers was conscripted intot the army as an officer straight out of the left wing hotbed of his university . " i joined the army in 1973 , in summer , exactly when officers were planning the coup d 'etat , " meshkeranyez says .
" i was amazed that even during the training phase of my conscription , officials spoke freely about the things and others could listen and even participate . " the situation was all the more astonishing given that for so long the control of the regime had been absolute . salazar sincerely believed that a dictatorship was the highest form of political wisdom . he blamed materialism and democracy for portugal 's problems .

a special government license was also needed to sell cigarette lighters . " in 1974 , some generals also started taking action against the government .
they began printing articles in newspapers , books and you knew that the regime was falling , falling , " remembers meshkeranyez . freedom at last the army then moved onto the streets . the people joined them with flowers thus the " revolution of the carnations " was born .
one soldier proudly wrote that he was part of the coup as an officer and a gentleman , with the task of arresting dictators . jose zello , a socialist mp in portugal 's national parliament remembers the joy of the moment .
" it was a big surprise when he heard the news that morning , it was a big joy to us .
it was not your typical revolution , there were people on the streets , without shots , without blood .
it was a big party . " 30 years on portugal faces challenges the change for portuguese was profound and immediate .
but , thirty years after the " revolution of the carnations " , some things do n't seem to have changed . portugal is near the top of the eu fraud league .
last year , farmers in the country claimed an eu subsidy for tens of thousands of animals .
half of the animals were later found to be ineligible , or not to exist . portugal is still one of the poorest countries in europe . over the last few years its gross domestic product has sunk behind that of greece . the current conservative government of jose manuel barroso is trying to revive the economy by emulating a u.s. style business philosophy - by easing hiring and firing laws , lowering taxes and privatizing state-run enterprises . but zello says much needs to change in portugal before economic measures can begin to have an impact .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .
in keeping with christo 's philosophy and his transiert artworks , it ends up in the shredder after the installation concludes . jessica merten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links christo and jeanne-claude -lrb- only in german -rrb- the gates christo and jeanne-claude 9800 dw-tv europe live discover germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

heinz fischer , the social democrat candidate won the austrian presidential election sunday , edging out conservative foreign minister ferrero-waldner , who was hoping to become the country 's first female head of state . with 50 percent of the votes counted , heinz fischer , the candidate of the opposition social democrats , had close to 52 percent of electorate support .
foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner , the conservative endorsed by haider , had just over 48 percent . right-wing populist jörg haider 's backing of ferrero-waldner and her rival 's critical stance toward the austrian rightist , whose appeal extends to the neo-nazi fringe , added spice to an otherwise humdrum race for the mostly ceremonial position . ferrero-waldner was supported by the conservative people 's party and key members of their government partners , haider 's right-leaning freedom party .
fischer is a deputy speaker of parliament . although the post of president is largely ceremonial , the result will thus indirectly show how the government coalition is faring in voter popularity midway through its term and in the aftermath of pension reforms and other unpopular legislation . slight differences in campaigns while few issues separated the two candidates , there were nuances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner -lrb- photo -rrb- , 55 , had cautiously favored debate on whether its time has come to reconsider the country 's 49-year-policy of neutrality , an important part of the austrian national identity . fischer , 65 , insisted neutrality is non negotiable , while at the same time favoring an undefined " solidarity pact " with the rest of the european union that would include some kind of military support in case of need . ferrero-waldner put herself forward as an internationally experienced leader , promising to spend most of her time selling austria abroad . she would have been the first female president , and her campaign marketed her as " the first . " fischer , meanwhile , promised to work to create opportunities for austria 's youth and security for the country 's elderly .
his election posters carried the slogan : " politics need a conscience . " a largely ceremonial post the austrian president is commander in chief of country 's tiny military , and the constitution gives the president the power to reject nominations for cabinet ministers or even to remove them from office - something that has rarely been done . still , with many austrians believing the office of president is obsolete , the chancellor runs the country 's day-to-day affairs . the elections in large part were significant for what that the results said say about the popularity of the parties supporting the two rivals . " fischer is the better candidate , but i 'm voting for ferrero , " said security guard karl woltemar , reflecting the trend to vote not for the two contenders but for the parties behind them .
" i do n't like the socialists . " haider : controversial as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governor of carinthia and top candidate of the freedom party jörg haider the rightist freedom party , whose former leader , haider -lrb- photo -rrb- , is notorious for past remarks that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of jews , did not give an official endorsement . still , haider made several campaign stops with ferrero-waldner , giving her a live pig as a good-luck charm during an event in the southern province of carinthia , where he is governor .
ferrero-waldner has sought the support of freedom party backers , and haider and others in his party said they would vote for her . fischer , in contrast has been criticized by haider and his colleagues for repeating his rejection of haider 's controversial remarks and for distancing himself from freedom party policies . current president thomas klestil , who put distance during his tenure from his backers , the people 's party , to become a political independent , is ending his second six-year term and is prohibited by the constitution from running for re-election . associated press send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers . deafening noise greets visitors to the large weaving mill belonging to the schilden company in the town of emsdette near münster , western germany .
amid 22 looms rolling out white technical textiles for the automobile industry , a glowing orange colored machine stands alone in the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian-born artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude this is what the weavers here call the christo machine , in deference to the famous bulgarian-born conceptual artist who together with his flame-haired french wife jeanne-claude has created spectacular transient artworks around the world over the past 40 years , largely involving wrapping swathes of fabric around gigantic objects . among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus and bundling up the reichstag in berlin . a weaving mill 's claim to fame the christo machine is currently cranking out sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow , as christo likes to describe the color .
the fabric is meant for christo and jeanne-claude 's latest project in new york . production head klaus schirmer , who makes regular rounds to the christo machine to check the evenness of the warmly shimmering fabric , says this is n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 there 's little doubt that the schilden weaving mill also stands to benefit enormously from the publicity that comes with being associated with a world-famous artist like christo .
the emsdette-based company wove the shimmering silver fabric that christo and jeanne-claude used nine years to shroud berlin 's reichstag or parliamentary building for two weeks in a statement of the city 's east-west political divide . it also worked for christo when he wrapped up some trees in basel , switzerland . company pulls off " the gates " coup in a further coup , the schilden company has now been commissioned by christo and jeanne-claude to weave the material for their latest project , " the gates " in new york 's central park , scheduled to open in february 2005 . the duo will set up a 16-day installation of 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels , each suspended within a free-standing framework 16 feet high and swaying at the whim of the wind .
placed at 12-foot intervals , the panels will occupy 23 miles of park walkways . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks .
the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom and is expected to provide a stark contrast to the bare trees in february . " the color alone is this gray bleakness in february in new york - that should be a fantastic thing , " says schirmer . no run-of-the-mill customers christo will pay the weaving mill around € 400,000 for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company .
company ceo stephan schilden explains how a modest family business like his hit upon the idea of seeking out christo as a customer . " by taking the initiative and contacting christo with the idea .
it 's as simple as that , " says schilden .
" i wrote to christo and offered to weave for him and presto , christo was interested . " schilden says that ever since the reichstag project , contact between his weavers and christo has been kept alive through continued negotiations over new projects , models , forms and colors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists christo and jeanne-claude pass their " wrapped oil barrels " created 1958-1959 schilden admits that artist couples do n't usually fit into his normal customer profile .
" christo is very reserved , both of them are very modest , very reliable .
christo is the more introverted one and jeanne-claude takes care of the business side . " schilden adds that the disposal of the swathes of fabric is already planned for by christo .

he said : " the adults can live for up to 20-25 years , but the survival rate for great bustard chicks in the wild is not great - 75 % of them will die in the first year .
" they do have a capacity for injuring themselves and the simple fact of the great outdoors is that there 're a lot of things that eat each other . "

mr annan was reacting to the greek cypriots ' overwhelming rejection of a un plan to reunite the island ; turkish cypriots voted in favour of the move .
the island will remain " divided and militarised " as it joins the european union on 1 may , mr annan said .
the eu has signalled that it will seek ways to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriot state .
shadow cast both sides had to approve the proposals for cyprus to be reunified in time for eu membership .
the result means that eu laws and benefits will apply only to the greek cypriot community .
over three-quarters of greek cypriots voted " no " in saturday 's referendum , unhappy at limits on their right to return to property in the turkish north .
turkish cypriots , in contrast , endorsed the plan with a 65 % majority , seeing it as a way to end the international isolation they have endured since turkish troops invaded the island in 1974 .
referendum result greek south yes : 24.2 % no : 75.8 % turnout : 88 % turkish north yes : 64.9 % no : 35.1 % turnout : 87 % " a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement .
the eu 's commissioner for expansion , guenter verheugen , was more blunt .
" there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus , " he told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . "
alvaro de soto , the un envoy who worked on the failed peace plan for nearly five years , said his office would close in the coming weeks .
asked how he felt , he told the associated press , " i would have to bite my tongue . "
the us said it was " disappointed " with the result , which was a " setback to the hopes of those on the island who voted for the settlement and to the international community " .
fears confirmed the greek cypriot rejection came as no surprise , but the margin was far larger than expected .
in pictures : cyprus votes guide to cyprus diplomats had hoped the deal would be defeated only narrowly , and that the same plan might be put to the people once again in a few months ' time .
but the nature of the result appears to rule this possibility out , says the bbc 's tabitha morgan in nicosia .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , who urged voters to reject the plan , said he remained committed to reaching a deal with the north .
" today 's result must act as a catalyst for reunification , and not be used as an excuse for further division , " he said .
but hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the un plan - called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
" there must be no uncertainty caused by futile attempts to force incompatible parties together , " mr denktash said .
his prime minister mehmet ali talat - a supporter of the plan - called on the un and the eu to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time .
mr talat said the isolation of northern cyprus must be ended or alleviated - a call echoed by turkey .
" the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gul .
after this vote , he said , ankara would not pull its 30,000 troops out of cyprus .
the plan crafted by un secretary-general kofi annan envisaged a loose federal structure for the island .
many greek cypriots refugees who fled the turkish assault would have been allowed to return and recover some of the land they lost .
but the greek side was unhappy that the plan limited their right to return , while allowing tens of thousands of turkish settlers introduced since 1974 to remain .

mr annan was reacting to the greek cypriots ' overwhelming rejection of a un plan to reunite the island ; turkish cypriots voted in favour of the move .
the island will remain " divided and militarised " as it joins the european union on 1 may , mr annan said .
the eu has signalled that it will seek ways to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriot state .
shadow cast both sides had to approve the proposals for cyprus to be reunified in time for eu membership .
the result means that eu laws and benefits will apply only to the greek cypriot community .
over three-quarters of greek cypriots voted " no " in saturday 's referendum , unhappy at limits on their right to return to property in the turkish north .
turkish cypriots , in contrast , endorsed the plan with a 65 % majority , seeing it as a way to end the international isolation they have endured since turkish troops invaded the island in 1974 .
referendum result greek south yes : 24.2 % no : 75.8 % turnout : 88 % turkish north yes : 64.9 % no : 35.1 % turnout : 87 % " a unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting cyprus issue has been missed , " the european commission said in a statement .
the eu 's commissioner for expansion , guenter verheugen , was more blunt .
" there is a shadow now over the accession of cyprus , " he told germany 's ard television .
" what we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the turkish cypriots . "
alvaro de soto , the un envoy who worked on the failed peace plan for nearly five years , said his office would close in the coming weeks .
asked how he felt , he told the associated press , " i would have to bite my tongue . "
the us said it was " disappointed " with the result , which was a " setback to the hopes of those on the island who voted for the settlement and to the international community " .
fears confirmed the greek cypriot rejection came as no surprise , but the margin was far larger than expected .
in pictures : cyprus votes guide to cyprus diplomats had hoped the deal would be defeated only narrowly , and that the same plan might be put to the people once again in a few months ' time .
but the nature of the result appears to rule this possibility out , says the bbc 's tabitha morgan in nicosia .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos , who urged voters to reject the plan , said he remained committed to reaching a deal with the north .
" today 's result must act as a catalyst for reunification , and not be used as an excuse for further division , " he said .
but hardline turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash - a fierce opponent of the un plan - called on the world to stop pressing the two sides to live together .
" there must be no uncertainty caused by futile attempts to force incompatible parties together , " mr denktash said .
his prime minister mehmet ali talat - a supporter of the plan - called on the un and the eu to take measures to redress the irony that the side that rejected the plan will become an eu member in a week 's time .
mr talat said the isolation of northern cyprus must be ended or alleviated - a call echoed by turkey .
" the embargoes must be lifted , the isolation must be brought to an end , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gul .
after this vote , he said , ankara would not pull its 30,000 troops out of cyprus .
the plan crafted by un secretary-general kofi annan envisaged a loose federal structure for the island .
many greek cypriots refugees who fled the turkish assault would have been allowed to return and recover some of the land they lost .
but the greek side was unhappy that the plan limited their right to return , while allowing tens of thousands of turkish settlers introduced since 1974 to remain .

ivor was a children 's favourite through the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , and even voted one of wales ' top 100 heroes in an official poll last year .
now the engine is being brought up to date with computer animation to promote the bbc wales digital channel 2w .
his original creators have even climbed aboard to help create three new short films .
oliver postgate and peter firmin , the kent-based creative team behind other children 's ' favourites including bagpuss , noggin the nog and the clangers , are bringing ivor back to tv .
the last new ivor programmes were made almost 30 years ago when the original black-and-white animations , some dating back to 1959 when the tv series was first launched , were remade in colour for the bbc .
now ivor 's adventures with idris the dragon and dai station are set to entertain , albeit briefly , a new generation .
bbc wales ' head of promotions , phillip moss , said mr postgate is delighted ivor has been brought out of retirement in the railway shed .
" he has voiced the new films , and we were able to track down anthony jackson , the original voice of dai station , to replay his part , " said mr moss .
" the next stage is to use a bassoon player from the bbc national orchestra of wales to be ivor 's ' voice ' . "
though peter firmin 's original animation used what mr moss described as " meccano and elastic bands " , the new versions , using the designer 's illustrations , will be animated by computer .
the three new promos - the longest lasts just 40 seconds - which will be screened by bbc wales next month .
in the three cartoons , dai station - a stickler for the rule book - is caught out watching bbc 2w when he should not be ; ivor himself refuses to move further along the tracks when he is captivated by 2w in a tv shop , and there is trouble in the signal box when the signalman is glued to his tv set - tuned to 2w .
last year ivor the engine was voted number 18 in the first stage of a poll to find the top 100 welsh heroes sponsored by the welsh assembly government .
ironically , mr postgate has no connection with wales and the only welsh person involved in the original animations - olwen griffiths who was the voice of idris the dragon and the series ' women - has since died .

we are near hubli in the southern indian state of karnataka , a town on the highway , which connects distant bombay to the boomtown of bangalore before winding its way on to madras on india 's south-east coast .
it is part of prime minister atal behari vajpayee 's golden quadrilateral highway project , which aims to link the capital delhi to four other major cities - bombay , bangalore , madras and calcutta .
hanumanthappa , a local farmer , shields his hand against the harsh midday sun as he gazes at the highway .
" what a road ! " he whispers in awe .
" at night you can hear the trucks roar along at high speeds .
it has made a huge difference to our lives . "
along the highway , people nod in agreement .
the improved road has brought in greater traffic , increasing the number of people who use the restaurants , phone-booths , shops and other services that have sprung up alongside .
" news of the highway project has spread across the countryside , " says local journalist gurunath .
" it is the first time many feel that something tangible has been done by a government . "
" the vajpayee wave is very strong in rural areas - it is inexplicable and incredible , " adds veteran journalist vn subba rao .
these are words that are music to the ears of officials of mr vajpayee 's bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- .
' extraordinary change ' the bjp sees karnataka as its gateway to southern india .
if it performs strongly in the current parliamentary elections , as well as state elections which are being held simultaneously here , it believes it can shake off the tag of being a party confined to the hindi-speaking belt in the north and central india .
senior bjp leader , arun jaitley , forecasts a big political change in karnataka , which has been a stronghold of the opposition congress party since independence in 1947 .
" we have seen in karnataka an extraordinary surge in favour of the bjp " he says .
he tells bbc news online that a victory in karnataka is very important for the bjp to be seen as a truly pan-indian party .
" that is why we have put in our very best in terms of efforts to come out with our best ever performance . "
hardline politicians just days before campaigning ends , the bjp flies down its controversial gujarat chief minister , narendra modi to address several rallies .
mr modi has been accused of doing little to prevent riots in his state two years ago , which led to the deaths of more than a 1,000 people , mainly muslims .
" today karnataka needs a change and bjp can bring about that change , " he says at a rally in mysore .
despite the apparent appreciation for the bjp , many in karnataka are uncomfortable with some of its more hardline politicians and policies .
along the coast , where the bjp has a strong presence and is expected to do very well , the mood is sombre among the muslim and christian minorities who make up almost 15 % of the population .
christians in particular have a very visible presence along the coast , which is sandwiched between kerala and the former portuguese enclave of goa .
george varkey , who lives in mangalore , sees the bjp turning india into a hindu rather than a secular nation .
" that is not fair .
everyone has to live here , " he says as he walks out of sunday service at the 100-year old st aloysius church .
but others such as norman moras says they have changed their perception of the bjp .
" christians were against the bjp but now there is a rethinking , " he says between rounds of rummy at the mangalore catholic club .
" vajpayee 's personal image has a lot to do with it . "
controversy but coastal karnataka , has been a stronghold of the bjp since the 90s because of its trading and mercantile communities who back the party 's economic policies .
" they have a network of strong leaders in the area , " says journalist subba rao .
many of these leaders have strong hindu nationalist roots and are now hoping to win parliamentary seats for the party .
in the canara constituency , the bjp has fielded anant kumar hegde against the sitting congress mp , former minister margaret alva .
in the 1990s mr hegde led a controversial campaign to raise the indian flag over the idgah maidan , a muslim prayer ground .
it led to violent clashes in which several died , and mr hegde still faces criminal cases in connection with the controversy .
he says he is very committed to controversial programmes such as building a temple on the ruins of a mosque in the northern town of ayodhya and other hindu nationalist policies .
" i will certainly fight for a uniform civil code and a ban on cow slaughter .
we are committed to this , " he says .
-lrb- under the current civil code , muslim men are , for example , allowed more than one wife -rrb- .
basic complaints as he campaigns in villages deep in the countryside , mr hegde steers clear of controversy confining his pledges to economic programmes .
" i need your support to strengthen the hand of the prime minister , to bring you the best government india has ever had , " he tells villagers in golgod .
it 's a message that is received with some scepticism in the remote village , deep in the forest and accessed only by dirt tracks .
" nothing has happened here in 50 years , says yellamma who runs a small teashop .
" look at it - we live in mud huts , we have no roads .
when it rains we feel we are living on an island because everything is washed away . "
mr hegde 's opponent believes the villagers of the area will continue to back the congress , as they have all these years .
" the bjp stands for the rich ... they have no programme for the rural people , " says margaret alva .
" there is a drought , no drinking water in the villages on both sides of this highway which they are building .
the common people are watching tankers and tankers of water spilt on the highway to construct them . "
back on national highway four hanumanthappa says he is still unsure of he will vote for .
it is voters like him who hold the key to the bjp 's dream of driving into the south .

national highway 4 - ' what a road ! '
we are near hubli in the southern indian state of karnataka , a town on the highway , which connects distant bombay to the boomtown of bangalore before winding its way on to madras on india 's south-east coast .
it is part of prime minister atal behari vajpayee 's golden quadrilateral highway project , which aims to link the capital delhi to four other major cities - bombay , bangalore , madras and calcutta .
hanumanthappa , a local farmer , shields his hand against the harsh midday sun as he gazes at the highway .
" what a road ! " he whispers in awe .
" at night you can hear the trucks roar along at high speeds .
it has made a huge difference to our lives . "
along the highway , people nod in agreement .
the improved road has brought in greater traffic , increasing the number of people who use the restaurants , phone-booths , shops and other services that have sprung up alongside .
" news of the highway project has spread across the countryside , " says local journalist gurunath .
" it is the first time many feel that something tangible has been done by a government . "
" the vajpayee wave is very strong in rural areas - it is inexplicable and incredible , " adds veteran journalist vn subba rao .
these are words that are music to the ears of officials of mr vajpayee 's bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- .
' extraordinary change ' the bjp sees karnataka as its gateway to southern india .
the bjp 's anant kumar hegde on the campaign trail if it performs strongly in the current parliamentary elections , as well as state elections which are being held simultaneously here , it believes it can shake off the tag of being a party confined to the hindi-speaking belt in the north and central india .
senior bjp leader , arun jaitley , forecasts a big political change in karnataka , which has been a stronghold of the opposition congress party since independence in 1947 .
" we have seen in karnataka an extraordinary surge in favour of the bjp " he says .
he tells bbc news online that a victory in karnataka is very important for the bjp to be seen as a truly pan-indian party .
" that is why we have put in our very best in terms of efforts to come out with our best ever performance . "
hardline politicians just days before campaigning ends , the bjp flies down its controversial gujarat chief minister , narendra modi to address several rallies .
the mood is sombre among muslim voters mr modi has been accused of doing little to prevent riots in his state two years ago , which led to the deaths of more than a 1,000 people , mainly muslims .
" today karnataka needs a change and bjp can bring about that change , " he says at a rally in mysore .
despite the apparent appreciation for the bjp , many in karnataka are uncomfortable with some of its more hardline politicians and policies .
along the coast , where the bjp has a strong presence and is expected to do very well , the mood is sombre among the muslim and christian minorities who make up almost 15 % of the population .
christians in particular have a very visible presence along the coast , which is sandwiched between kerala and the former portuguese enclave of goa .
george varkey , who lives in mangalore , sees the bjp turning india into a hindu rather than a secular nation .
" that is not fair .
everyone has to live here , " he says as he walks out of sunday service at the 100-year old st aloysius church .
but others such as norman moras says they have changed their perception of the bjp .
" christians were against the bjp but now there is a rethinking , " he says between rounds of rummy at the mangalore catholic club .
" vajpayee 's personal image has a lot to do with it . "
controversy but coastal karnataka , has been a stronghold of the bjp since the 90s because of its trading and mercantile communities who back the party 's economic policies .
congress mp margaret alva - the bjp is ' party of the rich ' " they have a network of strong leaders in the area , " says journalist subba rao .
many of these leaders have strong hindu nationalist roots and are now hoping to win parliamentary seats for the party .
in the canara constituency , the bjp has fielded anant kumar hegde against the sitting congress mp , former minister margaret alva .
in the 1990s mr hegde led a controversial campaign to raise the indian flag over the idgah maidan , a muslim prayer ground .
it led to violent clashes in which several died , and mr hegde still faces criminal cases in connection with the controversy .
he says he is very committed to controversial programmes such as building a temple on the ruins of a mosque in the northern town of ayodhya and other hindu nationalist policies .
" i will certainly fight for a uniform civil code and a ban on cow slaughter .
we are committed to this , " he says .
-lrb- under the current civil code , muslim men are , for example , allowed more than one wife -rrb- .
basic complaints as he campaigns in villages deep in the countryside , mr hegde steers clear of controversy confining his pledges to economic programmes .
villager yellamma is sceptical of bjp promises - ' nothing has improved in 50 years ' " i need your support to strengthen the hand of the prime minister , to bring you the best government india has ever had , " he tells villagers in golgod .
it 's a message that is received with some scepticism in the remote village , deep in the forest and accessed only by dirt tracks .
" nothing has happened here in 50 years , says yellamma who runs a small teashop .
" look at it - we live in mud huts , we have no roads .
when it rains we feel we are living on an island because everything is washed away . "
mr hegde 's opponent believes the villagers of the area will continue to back the congress , as they have all these years .
" the bjp stands for the rich ... they have no programme for the rural people , " says margaret alva .
" there is a drought , no drinking water in the villages on both sides of this highway which they are building .
