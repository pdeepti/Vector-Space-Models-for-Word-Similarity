" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the voice said .
" the door to a truce is open for three months , " it continued , adding the time frame could be extended .
" the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries , " namely afghanistan and iraq . most european countries spurned the al qaeda ultimatum when it first appeared , stressing that they were n't going to deal or bow down to any terrorist group .

british security authorities struck a similar tone .

romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .
scheibe hopes that bargain hunters will buy summer clothes for holidays in warmer countries . pellengahr has another theory .
summer sales satisfy the customers , he says . " and contented customers might spend the money they saved with bargains on full price products .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .

a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .

at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .

on friday , germany 's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest german-chinese joint ventures for solar energy there . the facility in jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world .
the site in this eastern chinese city , run by a sino-german joint venture , produces solar collectors to heat water .
it is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts .
" china has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told german business representatives at the inauguration ceremony .
" i am especially happy that china has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector , " he added .
solar power instead of chocolate the joint venture is owned by the german vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer paradigma , karlsbad , and chinese glass tubing producer linuo in jinan .
paradigma 's major shareholder is alfred ritter , better-known for his chocolate company ritter sport .
" with this joint venture , we are following a strategy to go where the markets are , " ritter said .
" in china , we 're producing for the asian market , in germany , for the european market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a handmade solar power cooker to boil water is popular among chinese villagers to conserve energy .
germany sees the shangdong linuo paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market .
" there are extraordinary opportunities here not only for large corporations , but also for mid-sized and small german companies , " said fischer , who is currently touring asia with a german business delegation .
china 's energy resources are running out china , the world 's largest solar energy market , is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s .
it has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles , iron and steel , as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's largest producer of coal .
energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in china than in other industrialized nations .
at the same time , it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring .
the symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout china .
in order to feed beijing 's growing energy needs , frequent blackouts occur across the country .
many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future a special dw-world series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .

" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .
eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian border guards detain two people suspected of being indian citizens who were crossing the belarusian-polish border illegally .
since eu expansion , germany has moved to the center of the bloc . the new eastern eu members are now under pressure to improve their patrols on the eu 's new external borders .
pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .
one of the most notorious camps , payshino , is located on the country 's western border .
according to a report by human rights watch , hundreds of illegal immigrants are being held in the camp under inhumane conditions . steffen leidel -lrb- luc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .

on friday , germany 's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest german-chinese joint ventures for solar energy there . the facility in jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world .
the site in this eastern chinese city , run by a sino-german joint venture , produces solar collectors to heat water .
it is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts .
" china has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told german business representatives at the inauguration ceremony .
" i am especially happy that china has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector , " he added .
solar power instead of chocolate the joint venture is owned by the german vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer paradigma , karlsbad , and chinese glass tubing producer linuo in jinan .
paradigma 's major shareholder is alfred ritter , better-known for his chocolate company ritter sport .
" with this joint venture , we are following a strategy to go where the markets are , " ritter said .
" in china , we 're producing for the asian market , in germany , for the european market . "

china 's energy resources are running out china , the world 's largest solar energy market , is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s .
it has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles , iron and steel , as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards .

energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in china than in other industrialized nations .
at the same time , it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring .
the symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout china .
in order to feed beijing 's growing energy needs , frequent blackouts occur across the country .
many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future a special dw-world series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.07.2004 europe 's invisible walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer watching over the straits of gibraltar illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .
high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .

" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the voice said .
" the door to a truce is open for three months , " it continued , adding the time frame could be extended .
" the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries , " namely afghanistan and iraq . most european countries spurned the al qaeda ultimatum when it first appeared , stressing that they were n't going to deal or bow down to any terrorist group . " attempt to divide europe will collapse " as the alleged al qaeda ultimatum expired on thursday , security officials in most european nations emphasized that while they were taking every threat seriously , there was no need for any immediate tightening of already stringent security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is no information that would require us to strengthen security measures , " a spokesman of german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in berlin this week and pointed out that security forces in the country were already on high alert . on thursday , a german government spokesman told ap that chancellor schröder was determined that al qaeda would not be able to drive a wedge in europe .
" the chancellor has already said that every attempt to divide europe will collapse , " he said . germany has around 2,000 peacekeepers in afghanistan .
while experts say there are n't any concrete indications of impending attacks , individuals acts could n't be ruled out by people who feel compelled to follow bin laden 's threat . german terrorism expert kai hirschmann said that increased vigilance in europe would repel terrorists from planning attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german soldiers in the afghan capital kabul " al qaeda does not in particular want to be predicable , " hirschmann said .
at the same time hirschmann said that fundamentally nothing had changed in the general security threat to germany .
" there can always be attacks .
germany is still in the crossfire … but it 's not dependant on deadlines . " europe refuses to bow to terror group the italian government , which has sent the third-largest military contingent among postwar forces in iraq , said that 14,000 sensitive targets in the country were already under heavy security surveillance . french interior minister dominique de villepin underlined this week that france was " on maximum alert all the time . "
british security authorities struck a similar tone .
" we are on high alert and will remain so . .. the threat of international terrorism is always present and independent of deadlines " a statement said . the response was the much the same in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian military police officer in iraq " we do n't intend to budge to terrorists , " a spokesman for the slovak foreign ministry , juraj tomaga told ap .
when asked about the deadline , romania 's foreign ministry spokesman , bogdan manoiu , said there was no question about removing troops or shifting away from security duties in iraq .
romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .
scheibe hopes that bargain hunters will buy summer clothes for holidays in warmer countries . pellengahr has another theory .
summer sales satisfy the customers , he says . " and contented customers might spend the money they saved with bargains on full price products .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the voice said .
" the door to a truce is open for three months , " it continued , adding the time frame could be extended .
" the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries , " namely afghanistan and iraq . most european countries spurned the al qaeda ultimatum when it first appeared , stressing that they were n't going to deal or bow down to any terrorist group . " attempt to divide europe will collapse " as the alleged al qaeda ultimatum expired on thursday , security officials in most european nations emphasized that while they were taking every threat seriously , there was no need for any immediate tightening of already stringent security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is no information that would require us to strengthen security measures , " a spokesman of german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in berlin this week and pointed out that security forces in the country were already on high alert . on thursday , a german government spokesman told ap that chancellor schröder was determined that al qaeda would not be able to drive a wedge in europe .
" the chancellor has already said that every attempt to divide europe will collapse , " he said . germany has around 2,000 peacekeepers in afghanistan .
while experts say there are n't any concrete indications of impending attacks , individuals acts could n't be ruled out by people who feel compelled to follow bin laden 's threat . german terrorism expert kai hirschmann said that increased vigilance in europe would repel terrorists from planning attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german soldiers in the afghan capital kabul " al qaeda does not in particular want to be predicable , " hirschmann said .
at the same time hirschmann said that fundamentally nothing had changed in the general security threat to germany .
" there can always be attacks .
germany is still in the crossfire … but it 's not dependant on deadlines . " europe refuses to bow to terror group the italian government , which has sent the third-largest military contingent among postwar forces in iraq , said that 14,000 sensitive targets in the country were already under heavy security surveillance . french interior minister dominique de villepin underlined this week that france was " on maximum alert all the time . "
british security authorities struck a similar tone .
" we are on high alert and will remain so . .. the threat of international terrorism is always present and independent of deadlines " a statement said . the response was the much the same in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian military police officer in iraq " we do n't intend to budge to terrorists , " a spokesman for the slovak foreign ministry , juraj tomaga told ap .
when asked about the deadline , romania 's foreign ministry spokesman , bogdan manoiu , said there was no question about removing troops or shifting away from security duties in iraq .
romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat . " it 's not about whether there are going to be any attacks , but rather only when and where , " said journalist elmar thevessen , who criticized europe 's unpreparedness and lack of a common strategy to deal with terrorist attacks . shot in morocco , spain , england , italy and germany , the reporters spoke to supporters of the terrorists , experts , political scientists and investigators in the countries to probe the ideology and breeding grounds of the new international terrorism threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid on march 11 most intelligence experts interviewed for the film stressed that europe had to be more aware of the insidious dangers of islamic terrorism as was shown in madrid . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep , there will be apathy , " said michael chandler , former un chief investigator . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks .
-lrb- april 15 , 2004 -rrb- security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .
eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian border guards detain two people suspected of being indian citizens who were crossing the belarusian-polish border illegally .
since eu expansion , germany has moved to the center of the bloc . the new eastern eu members are now under pressure to improve their patrols on the eu 's new external borders .
pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .
one of the most notorious camps , payshino , is located on the country 's western border .
according to a report by human rights watch , hundreds of illegal immigrants are being held in the camp under inhumane conditions . steffen leidel -lrb- luc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i announce a truce with the european countries that do not attack muslim countries , " the voice said .
" the door to a truce is open for three months , " it continued , adding the time frame could be extended .
" the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries , " namely afghanistan and iraq . most european countries spurned the al qaeda ultimatum when it first appeared , stressing that they were n't going to deal or bow down to any terrorist group . " attempt to divide europe will collapse " as the alleged al qaeda ultimatum expired on thursday , security officials in most european nations emphasized that while they were taking every threat seriously , there was no need for any immediate tightening of already stringent security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is no information that would require us to strengthen security measures , " a spokesman of german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in berlin this week and pointed out that security forces in the country were already on high alert . on thursday , a german government spokesman told ap that chancellor schröder was determined that al qaeda would not be able to drive a wedge in europe .
" the chancellor has already said that every attempt to divide europe will collapse , " he said . germany has around 2,000 peacekeepers in afghanistan .
while experts say there are n't any concrete indications of impending attacks , individuals acts could n't be ruled out by people who feel compelled to follow bin laden 's threat . german terrorism expert kai hirschmann said that increased vigilance in europe would repel terrorists from planning attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german soldiers in the afghan capital kabul " al qaeda does not in particular want to be predicable , " hirschmann said .
at the same time hirschmann said that fundamentally nothing had changed in the general security threat to germany .
" there can always be attacks .
germany is still in the crossfire … but it 's not dependant on deadlines . " europe refuses to bow to terror group the italian government , which has sent the third-largest military contingent among postwar forces in iraq , said that 14,000 sensitive targets in the country were already under heavy security surveillance . french interior minister dominique de villepin underlined this week that france was " on maximum alert all the time . "
british security authorities struck a similar tone .
" we are on high alert and will remain so . .. the threat of international terrorism is always present and independent of deadlines " a statement said . the response was the much the same in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian military police officer in iraq " we do n't intend to budge to terrorists , " a spokesman for the slovak foreign ministry , juraj tomaga told ap .
when asked about the deadline , romania 's foreign ministry spokesman , bogdan manoiu , said there was no question about removing troops or shifting away from security duties in iraq .
romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat . " it 's not about whether there are going to be any attacks , but rather only when and where , " said journalist elmar thevessen , who criticized europe 's unpreparedness and lack of a common strategy to deal with terrorist attacks . shot in morocco , spain , england , italy and germany , the reporters spoke to supporters of the terrorists , experts , political scientists and investigators in the countries to probe the ideology and breeding grounds of the new international terrorism threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid on march 11 most intelligence experts interviewed for the film stressed that europe had to be more aware of the insidious dangers of islamic terrorism as was shown in madrid .

-lrb- april 15 , 2004 -rrb- security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .
scheibe hopes that bargain hunters will buy summer clothes for holidays in warmer countries . pellengahr has another theory .
summer sales satisfy the customers , he says . " and contented customers might spend the money they saved with bargains on full price products .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .
scheibe hopes that bargain hunters will buy summer clothes for holidays in warmer countries . pellengahr has another theory .
summer sales satisfy the customers , he says . " and contented customers might spend the money they saved with bargains on full price products .

while experts say there are n't any concrete indications of impending attacks , individuals acts could n't be ruled out by people who feel compelled to follow bin laden 's threat . german terrorism expert kai hirschmann said that increased vigilance in europe would repel terrorists from planning attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german soldiers in the afghan capital kabul " al qaeda does not in particular want to be predicable , " hirschmann said .
at the same time hirschmann said that fundamentally nothing had changed in the general security threat to germany .
" there can always be attacks .
germany is still in the crossfire … but it 's not dependant on deadlines . " europe refuses to bow to terror group the italian government , which has sent the third-largest military contingent among postwar forces in iraq , said that 14,000 sensitive targets in the country were already under heavy security surveillance . french interior minister dominique de villepin underlined this week that france was " on maximum alert all the time . "
british security authorities struck a similar tone .
" we are on high alert and will remain so . .. the threat of international terrorism is always present and independent of deadlines " a statement said . the response was the much the same in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian military police officer in iraq " we do n't intend to budge to terrorists , " a spokesman for the slovak foreign ministry , juraj tomaga told ap .
when asked about the deadline , romania 's foreign ministry spokesman , bogdan manoiu , said there was no question about removing troops or shifting away from security duties in iraq .
romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat . " it 's not about whether there are going to be any attacks , but rather only when and where , " said journalist elmar thevessen , who criticized europe 's unpreparedness and lack of a common strategy to deal with terrorist attacks . shot in morocco , spain , england , italy and germany , the reporters spoke to supporters of the terrorists , experts , political scientists and investigators in the countries to probe the ideology and breeding grounds of the new international terrorism threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid on march 11 most intelligence experts interviewed for the film stressed that europe had to be more aware of the insidious dangers of islamic terrorism as was shown in madrid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.07.2004 germany 's retail industry left out in the rain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping 's the last thing on their minds this year 's elusive summer has ruined germans ' mood to shop and added to the woes of a retail industry already suffering from low consumer spending .
summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .
eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian border guards detain two people suspected of being indian citizens who were crossing the belarusian-polish border illegally .
since eu expansion , germany has moved to the center of the bloc . the new eastern eu members are now under pressure to improve their patrols on the eu 's new external borders .
pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .
one of the most notorious camps , payshino , is located on the country 's western border .
according to a report by human rights watch , hundreds of illegal immigrants are being held in the camp under inhumane conditions . steffen leidel -lrb- luc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .
the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .

" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .
with the mercury hitting record levels of 40 degrees celsius and more , one would think that germans would be queuing up to buy the right accessories and outfits to beat the heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl cools off under a shower at an outdoor swimming pool in düsseldorf last summer .
instead , stores had to contend with people preferring to go swimming or cooling off under shady trees to trying on summer clothes in muggy shops .
" extreme weather conditions are always unfavorable , " said michael scheibe , spokesperson for karstadt , one of germany 's biggest department stores . focusing on price reduction bad weather aside , the german retail industry is also suffering from a general depression fuelled by a sluggish economy , rising unemployment and fears surrounding a new slew of social and labor market reforms .
" customers are more insecure than ever about their jobs and are trying to save money " says scheibe . instead of relying on the highly unpredictable weather , retailers are now focusing on aggressive price reductions to attract customers . " rather than letting the products collect dust on the shelves , retail traders reduce prices " said hubertus pellengahr , manager for the association of german retail sales -lrb- hde -rrb- .
discounts of up to 50 percent are possible .
" if that does not suffice we carry on with price-cutting " , says karstadt 's scheibe . summer sales a saving grace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a customer hunts through a summer clearance sale the one tried and tested method that stores can bank on to lure customers are the traditional summer clearance sales , usually held at the end of july - a mecca for bargain hunters . however , the fixed end-of-july dates for the yearly summer clearance sales were abolished in june 2004 .
instead a new law against unfair competition now allows shops to decide on their own about seasonal sales and discounts . but changing old habits is n't easy .
" the customers expect something at the end of july - the date is deep-seated in their heads , " said scheibe .
karstadt , for one , has begun to reinvent the summer sales as a karstadt sale .
others are following suit . the industry remains optimistic that the old trick will work .
scheibe hopes that bargain hunters will buy summer clothes for holidays in warmer countries . pellengahr has another theory .
summer sales satisfy the customers , he says . " and contented customers might spend the money they saved with bargains on full price products .

on friday , germany 's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest german-chinese joint ventures for solar energy there . the facility in jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world .
the site in this eastern chinese city , run by a sino-german joint venture , produces solar collectors to heat water .
it is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts .
" china has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told german business representatives at the inauguration ceremony .
" i am especially happy that china has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector , " he added .
solar power instead of chocolate the joint venture is owned by the german vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer paradigma , karlsbad , and chinese glass tubing producer linuo in jinan .
paradigma 's major shareholder is alfred ritter , better-known for his chocolate company ritter sport .
" with this joint venture , we are following a strategy to go where the markets are , " ritter said .
" in china , we 're producing for the asian market , in germany , for the european market . "

germany sees the shangdong linuo paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market .

china 's energy resources are running out china , the world 's largest solar energy market , is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s .
it has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles , iron and steel , as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards .

energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in china than in other industrialized nations .
at the same time , it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring .
the symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout china .
in order to feed beijing 's growing energy needs , frequent blackouts occur across the country .
many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future a special dw-world series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

summer sales and discounts seem the only way to keep afloat . gloomy skies and dark clouds may be the weather conditions currently dominating most parts of germany .
but it 's also an apt metaphor for the country 's struggling retail industry reconciling itself to the fact that the lack of plentiful sunshine this summer might just mean fewer customers . the textile branch especially is " dramatically affected by the bad weather , " said professor johann hellwege , business manager for the trade association for mid- and large-size retailers , bag . ulrich martinius of bag agrees .
" there 's a clear decline of the average sales volume of the retail trade , " said martinius .
" there 's about 2 percent less profit from january to june 2004 as compared to last year " . last year , at least in terms of the weather , was an extraordinary one .

" attempt to divide europe will collapse " as the alleged al qaeda ultimatum expired on thursday , security officials in most european nations emphasized that while they were taking every threat seriously , there was no need for any immediate tightening of already stringent security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is no information that would require us to strengthen security measures , " a spokesman of german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in berlin this week and pointed out that security forces in the country were already on high alert . on thursday , a german government spokesman told ap that chancellor schröder was determined that al qaeda would not be able to drive a wedge in europe .
" the chancellor has already said that every attempt to divide europe will collapse , " he said . germany has around 2,000 peacekeepers in afghanistan .
while experts say there are n't any concrete indications of impending attacks , individuals acts could n't be ruled out by people who feel compelled to follow bin laden 's threat . german terrorism expert kai hirschmann said that increased vigilance in europe would repel terrorists from planning attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german soldiers in the afghan capital kabul " al qaeda does not in particular want to be predicable , " hirschmann said .
at the same time hirschmann said that fundamentally nothing had changed in the general security threat to germany .
" there can always be attacks .
germany is still in the crossfire … but it 's not dependant on deadlines . " europe refuses to bow to terror group the italian government , which has sent the third-largest military contingent among postwar forces in iraq , said that 14,000 sensitive targets in the country were already under heavy security surveillance . french interior minister dominique de villepin underlined this week that france was " on maximum alert all the time . "
british security authorities struck a similar tone .
" we are on high alert and will remain so . .. the threat of international terrorism is always present and independent of deadlines " a statement said . the response was the much the same in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian military police officer in iraq " we do n't intend to budge to terrorists , " a spokesman for the slovak foreign ministry , juraj tomaga told ap .
when asked about the deadline , romania 's foreign ministry spokesman , bogdan manoiu , said there was no question about removing troops or shifting away from security duties in iraq .
romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat . " it 's not about whether there are going to be any attacks , but rather only when and where , " said journalist elmar thevessen , who criticized europe 's unpreparedness and lack of a common strategy to deal with terrorist attacks . shot in morocco , spain , england , italy and germany , the reporters spoke to supporters of the terrorists , experts , political scientists and investigators in the countries to probe the ideology and breeding grounds of the new international terrorism threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid on march 11 most intelligence experts interviewed for the film stressed that europe had to be more aware of the insidious dangers of islamic terrorism as was shown in madrid . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep , there will be apathy , " said michael chandler , former un chief investigator . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe outraged by alleged bin laden tape eu leaders on thursday dismissed the offer of a " truce " from terrorist leader osama bin laden , who said his terror network al qaeda might spare europe from attacks .
-lrb- april 15 , 2004 -rrb- security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

" i would like to see the germans spared custody , " schröder told n24 tv in his first comment on the issue . the three were arrested on monday after the italian authorities allowed 37 africans to disembark in sicily after three weeks on the ship . they had faced up to 12 years in jail and a fine of € 15,000 -lrb- $ 18,500 -rrb- for each immigrant they brought into the country if charged and convicted . italian authorties had accused the cap anamur of telling a " pack of lies " to get them to allow the africans ashore .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .
however , the attention surrounding the story will fade away sooner or later , the media will lose interest and the politicians will eventually calm down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .
eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian border guards detain two people suspected of being indian citizens who were crossing the belarusian-polish border illegally .
since eu expansion , germany has moved to the center of the bloc . the new eastern eu members are now under pressure to improve their patrols on the eu 's new external borders .
pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .
one of the most notorious camps , payshino , is located on the country 's western border .
according to a report by human rights watch , hundreds of illegal immigrants are being held in the camp under inhumane conditions . steffen leidel -lrb- luc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .

" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

on friday , germany 's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest german-chinese joint ventures for solar energy there . the facility in jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world .
the site in this eastern chinese city , run by a sino-german joint venture , produces solar collectors to heat water .
it is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts .
" china has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told german business representatives at the inauguration ceremony .
" i am especially happy that china has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector , " he added .
solar power instead of chocolate the joint venture is owned by the german vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer paradigma , karlsbad , and chinese glass tubing producer linuo in jinan .
paradigma 's major shareholder is alfred ritter , better-known for his chocolate company ritter sport .
" with this joint venture , we are following a strategy to go where the markets are , " ritter said .
" in china , we 're producing for the asian market , in germany , for the european market . "

germany sees the shangdong linuo paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market .
" there are extraordinary opportunities here not only for large corporations , but also for mid-sized and small german companies , " said fischer , who is currently touring asia with a german business delegation .
china 's energy resources are running out china , the world 's largest solar energy market , is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s .
it has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles , iron and steel , as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards .

energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in china than in other industrialized nations .
at the same time , it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring .
the symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout china .
in order to feed beijing 's growing energy needs , frequent blackouts occur across the country .
many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future a special dw-world series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

high-tech surveillance systems leave them no choice but to take far more dangerous routes . four weeks ago , the german aid organization cap anamur found 37 africans drifting on open waters in a small dinghy .
in the meantime , the organization has shipped the refugees to italy where they 've been taken into custody .
a great deal of journalists and some of the most important italian and german government authorities are currently caught up in the case .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of illegal immigrants in spain .
but immigrants will not give up attempting to cross the mediterranean sea .
just one week ago , 39 moroccans tried to bridge over 200 kilometers in order to reach the canary island of fuerteventura .
this route is considered to be particularly dangerous due to very unpredictable sea conditions .
the refugees barely have a chance of passing through undetected .
two years ago , the canary islands established a high-tech surveillance system that can even detect an air bed on the ocean 's surface .
immigrants forced into dangerous routes a new surveillance system , sive -lrb- integrated external vigilance system -rrb- , scans coastal areas for illegal immigrants using high resolution infrared cameras as well as radar systems in patrol boats and helicopters .
in 2002 , sive was installed at the straits of gibraltar where only 14 kilometers lie between africa and europe .
it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

it turned out that the system was highly efficient in spain - awakening us interest in sive for the war against terror .
because of sive , the number of refugee boats has decreased by half . sive can also help to locate ships much faster than before , which can be life-saving for people in need of rescue .
still , non-government organizations such as " andalucía acoge , " which looks after illegal immigrants , oppose the system since refugees now choose more dangerous routes in order to bypass surveillance systems .
bulk-heading , the only solution the german human rights organization pro asyl estimates that , in the last few years alone , around 5,000 people have drowned in the mediterranean sea .
" the only possible solution concerning the refugee problem is to seal europe off , " said karl kopp of pro asyl .
at the eu summit in thessaloniki in june 2003 , the securing of europe 's borders became a top priority .
the heads of state decided to strengthen border patrol by investing a sum of € 400 million .
kopp criticizes the continued spending to upgrade europe 's borders when little is done at the source of the problem .
" the refugees should already be caught in african harbors , " kopp said . according to kopp , italy has equipped some african countries with the necessary means to patrol their borders , with the result that the number of larger refugee boats has been reduced .
but these measures have also resulted in greater numbers of refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean in smaller , less detectible boats .

since eu expansion , germany has moved to the center of the bloc . the new eastern eu members are now under pressure to improve their patrols on the eu 's new external borders .
pro asyl fears that the eastern states are n't capable of dealing with the expected wave of immigrants and would to seal themselves off as a result .
this kind of behavior would lead to the establishment of refugee camps along the borders of these countries , says kopp .
such a development has already occurred in ukraine .
one of the most notorious camps , payshino , is located on the country 's western border .

the group said it found the africans in distress floating on a dinghy in the mediterranean last month . italy had repeatedly refused to admit the africans saying malta should take them as the ship stopped there first , and only relented under the glare of the international media when the situation onboard reportedly began to deteriorate . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said wednesday the asylum claims by the 37 africans from ghana , nigeria and niger were unacceptable , but would be heard by the country 's refugee agency . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row simmers over arrest of german aid workers the founder of a german aid group , whose boat helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week , has criticized members of his own organization for their handling of the situation in the mediterranean sea -lrb- july 15 , 2004 -rrb- berlin , rome spar over refugee ship the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in .

" the door to a truce is open for three months , " it continued , adding the time frame could be extended .
" the truce will begin when the last soldier leaves our countries , " namely afghanistan and iraq . most european countries spurned the al qaeda ultimatum when it first appeared , stressing that they were n't going to deal or bow down to any terrorist group .

romania has 730 troops in iraq and 500 in afghanistan . the only exception was the netherlands , who announced last weekend that they were to beef up security with an eye on the al qaeda ultimatum .
there are around 1,300 dutch soldiers stationed in iraq . " as long as it does n't happen on your doorstep " however , a documentary film on the al qaeda threat to europe that was aired on german public broadcaster zdf on thursday evening painted a bleak picture of the al qaeda threat . " it 's not about whether there are going to be any attacks , but rather only when and where , " said journalist elmar thevessen , who criticized europe 's unpreparedness and lack of a common strategy to deal with terrorist attacks . shot in morocco , spain , england , italy and germany , the reporters spoke to supporters of the terrorists , experts , political scientists and investigators in the countries to probe the ideology and breeding grounds of the new international terrorism threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid on march 11 most intelligence experts interviewed for the film stressed that europe had to be more aware of the insidious dangers of islamic terrorism as was shown in madrid .

however the size of the share sale was cut , and the sum fell short of the $ 1.95bn maximum it had hoped to raise .
the firm will start trading on the new york stock exchange and the korea stock exchange on 23 july .
lg philips lcd is a 50-50 joint venture between south korea 's lg electronics and dutch firm philips electronics .
the company is the world 's second largest lcd screen maker behind samsung .
lg philips ' offering - a 10.4 % stake - values the entire company at $ 9.7bn.
after the shares sale each of the firms ' stake will be reduced to 44.8 % from 50 % .
new factory the firm is selling 33.6 million shares at $ 30 -lrb- 34,500 won -rrb- each , the bottom of a $ 30-36 range , in the second-largest tech stock offering in asia this year .
it plans to use the cash to build its seventh factory as part of decade-long , $ 21bn plan to increase production of flat screens .
the upgrade from traditional cathode-ray boxes is expected to be the biggest change in tv technology since the switch to colour from black-and-white .
however there have been recent signs that an increase in production of lcd screens will mean manufacturers have to drop prices .
market leader samsung electronics said this week it expected lcd prices to fall by up to 20 % in the second half of 2004 as supplies grow .
restructuring at lg philips has cost jobs in recent years .
its display factory in newport , wales , ended production in august 2003 and all 870 jobs at the site were lost .
