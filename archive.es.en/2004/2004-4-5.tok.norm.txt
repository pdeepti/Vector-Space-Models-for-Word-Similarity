the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2004 hunt continues for surviving madrid suspects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five suspects died in the leganes blast but police still believe others from the cell remain at large .
after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2004 -pipe- 18:00 utc new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers over the weekend and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers . sweden and the netherlands are two of the six countries - along with the uk , france , germany and austria - that wrote to commission president romano prodi last december asking him to cap the eu budget at one percent of gross national income .

a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .

as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2004 -pipe- 18:00 utc new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers over the weekend and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers . sweden and the netherlands are two of the six countries - along with the uk , france , germany and austria - that wrote to commission president romano prodi last december asking him to cap the eu budget at one percent of gross national income .
the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .

the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .

truszczynski , however , admitted on friday that this issue remains an " open but difficult " one , and that it is " difficult to image a compromise " due to the different opinions among the countries .
poland has been strongly pushing to have a reference to the christian heritage in the text , but this has been opposed by some of the current eu states , among them france and belgium .

the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

truszczynski , however , admitted on friday that this issue remains an " open but difficult " one , and that it is " difficult to image a compromise " due to the different opinions among the countries .
poland has been strongly pushing to have a reference to the christian heritage in the text , but this has been opposed by some of the current eu states , among them france and belgium .
while addressing the issue of the constitution talks to polish deputies , truszczynski said that the polish government is in favor of establishing a balance which respects both the big and small eu countries in the voting mechanisms of the council .

the idea , agreed in principle last year , will be on the agenda as ministers meet ‘ informally ’ in brussels to sketch out some of the details of the plan .
initially made up of 20 or so planners , the unit will be responsible for preparing eu peacekeeping , crisis management and humanitarian operations .
the ministers will also discuss plans to create a set of eu battle groups that would be able to conduct operations in a series of environments .
foreign ministers last month agreed to take up the plan , asking the irish presidency to produce a report by june .
the plan is expected to mirror a previous one tabled by france , germany and the uk .
the big three proposed seven ‘ battle groups ’ be set up of 1,500 troops , each able to fight in a different environment .
the groups should be ready for deployment at 15 days notice and be able to stay in the field for 30 days .
it is likely that the groups will act as a standing force for un operations , but will also be able to take up the eu ’ s own missions .
also on the agenda of monday 's meeting is the takeover of nato 's sfor mission in bosnia , which the eu looks set to take on late this year .

the idea , agreed in principle last year , will be on the agenda as ministers meet ‘ informally ’ in brussels to sketch out some of the details of the plan .
initially made up of 20 or so planners , the unit will be responsible for preparing eu peacekeeping , crisis management and humanitarian operations .
the ministers will also discuss plans to create a set of eu battle groups that would be able to conduct operations in a series of environments .
foreign ministers last month agreed to take up the plan , asking the irish presidency to produce a report by june .
the plan is expected to mirror a previous one tabled by france , germany and the uk .
the big three proposed seven ‘ battle groups ’ be set up of 1,500 troops , each able to fight in a different environment .
the groups should be ready for deployment at 15 days notice and be able to stay in the field for 30 days .
it is likely that the groups will act as a standing force for un operations , but will also be able to take up the eu ’ s own missions .

with a total of 3,670 troops , the german contingent is the largest in kosovo . those stationed in the province were surprised by the attacks , which began after three ethnic albanian boys had drowned after serbs allegedly chased them into a river . many of the soldiers , who had to evacuate serbian enclaves and monestaries that had been set on fire , said they had n't expected the extent and rapid spreading of the violence .
they will share their stories with struck and present him with demands to improve working conditions . while additional danish and u.s. soldiers have already left kosovo again , leading officers from the german contingent of the un kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- have called for extra equipment and more soldiers : things have quieted down , they say , but the situation is far from being stable . as a result of the most recent clashes , struck has made it clear that he expects german soldiers to stay in kosovo past an earlier departure date of 2006 , a position he reiterated during monday 's visit to kosovo 's capital pristina . political solution remains uncertain saying that german soliders can not be stationed in the province indefinitely , friedbert pflüger , a foreign policy expert for the opposition christian democrats , meanwhile called on struck to present a proposal for the region 's future upon his return from kosovo .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .

spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2004 -pipe- 18:00 utc new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers over the weekend and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers . sweden and the netherlands are two of the six countries - along with the uk , france , germany and austria - that wrote to commission president romano prodi last december asking him to cap the eu budget at one percent of gross national income .
the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .

the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .
spanish police are now holding 24 people as part of their investigations .
five have already been accused of crimes associated with the madrid attacks after being brought before a madrid judge a week after the attacks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators probe germany link in madrid attacks federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany .

the current ceiling is 1.24 percent of gni .
but prodi ignored the request , unveiling instead a budget of roughly € 900 billion over the period and igniting a row between the commission and its main sources of cash .
a source close to the swedish government said that if current member states were to fund their own poorer regions after enlargement , then the budget could be capped at one percent without touching any other categories of spending .
but funding would still go to poorer regions of the new member states .
all finance ministers reportedly agree that the principle of supporting the poorer regions in the 10 accession countries should remain .
as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

as it stands , regions in the current eu-15 whose gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is less than 75 percent of the eu average are eligible for eu support .
after 1 may , the average eu gdp will decrease , meaning that 17 regions - mainly in southern europe - will stop being eligible for this funding , despite not actually getting richer in real terms .

after the explosion which killed the alleged madrid bombing mastermind " the tunisian " and four of his associates , spanish police continue to hunt those who got away . the hunt for the remaining members of a terror cell wanted for the madrid train bombings is being stepped up in the wake of the explosion at an apartment in a suburb of the spanish capital over the weekend . spanish security forces are continuing to pursue leads in an attempt to capture several suspects who may have escaped the blast which killed the group 's alleged ringleader , serhane ben abdelmajid fakhet , and four associates . investigators searching the apartment discovered at least two rucksacks with explosives ready to be set off , indicating that the march 11 bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1800 was the start of a campaign rather than the end .
the interior minister angel acebes said the haul of prepared explosives proved the cell had been poised to strike again . three suspects from a list of suspects are still at large : moroccan brothers mohammed and rachid oulad akcha and moroccan said berraj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blast , set off by the suspects as police closed in on an apartment in leganes , south of madrid on saturday , also killed one policeman and injured 11 others , some seriously . suspects detonated bomb as police advanced spanish police were about to storm the building after investigations into the commuter train bombings three weeks ago led them to the three suspects .
the police operation began when security officers approached the apartment but the situation soon escalated when the suspects spotted them from a window and they " started shooting from the apartment , chanting in arabic , " according acebes . police then evacuated residents in the building and the surrounding area , and cordoned it off .
a team then re-entered the apartment block and it was at this point , scoring to the interior minister , that the suspects set off a huge explosion in the apartment that the police were seeking to search , in what is believed to have been an attempt to resist arrest . " the special police agents prepared to storm the building and when they started to execute the plan , the terrorists set off a powerful explosion , blowing themselves up , " acebes said .
" there are three that blew themselves up , but the possibility of more is not ruled out . suspects believed to be of moroccan origin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " police believe some of the terrorists ... could have been some sought by the security forces as the alleged perpetrators of the killings of march 11 . "
the interior minister refused to identify the men , but spanish media describe them as young islamist militants of moroccan origin . neighbours said a group of north africans had moved into the apartment about a month ago .
they were rarely seen and the blinds were always drawn , the neighbours said .
last week , judge juan del olmo issued an international arrest warrant for fakhet , a man he described as the " leader and co-ordinator of the different people implicated " in the madrid bombings .
the warrants named fakhet as the man allegedly responsible for declaring a " jihad " or holy war in madrid sometime in 2003 .
fakhet " not only was the energising force for the awareness campaign for the jihad … but also with specific intent -lrb- since the middle of 2003 at least -rrb- for the preparation of a violent act in spain , specifically in the madrid area , " judge juan del olmo said .
other warrants were also issued for five moroccans who may have disappeared from spain after the bombings .
one of those wanted has been traced to an al qaeda meeting in istanbul in 2000 ; the others include the two brothers of the only woman jailed in the case , and a man who rented the house used to prepare the bombs .
north african link becomes stronger fakhet , also known as " the tunisian " was the first person from that north african country suspected in the case .
spanish police have so far focused on suspects from morocco after spain 's interior ministry identified the al qaeda-linked moroccan islamic combatant group as the prime suspect in the madrid attacks .
the group is believed to be the forerunner of salafia jihadia , which morocco blamed for bombings in casablanca that killed 33 people and 12 suicide bombers last year .

mr meciar 's years in office between 1994 and 1998 were criticised by western leaders for their lack of democracy and rule of law .
in a surprise result , mr meciar won 32.7 % of the votes cast , with his former ally , ivan gasparovic , in second place with 22.3 % of the vote .
the two winners will go through to the second round run-off on 17 april .
the poll was widely expected to be won by the government-backed candidate , foreign minister eduard kukan .
he had enjoyed some 30 % in the opinion polls , but trailed in third place with 22.1 % .
correspondents say the outcome is a major embarrassment for the government , coming just weeks before slovakia joins the european union .
eleven candidates stood for the post , which is largely ceremonial .
reforms mr meciar is particularly popular with elderly voters , who have suffered in the market-oriented reforms slovakia has since undergone .
" it 's simple .
i voted for meciar because under his rule my life was better .
we , pensioners , had more money to live on , " a voter told associated press news agency .

the two flag carriers had combined sales in 2002-03 of 19.2bn euros -lrb- $ 24.5bn ; £ 13bn -rrb- .
monday also brought news for klm in the shape of fuller aircraft .
the firm , whose high number of asian routes left it heavily damaged by the sars virus last year , said that heavy promotions in europe had helped boost its load factor - the measure of seats occupied - up 5.4 points to 82.5 % in march .
structure klm shareholders have until 3 may to take or leave the offer .
if sufficient numbers accept , the two firms will form a joint holding company to ensure the brands keep trading side by side for at least three years .
even after that , the dutch government and two foundations - klm 's current owners - will retain 51 % of voting rights over that arm of the new company .
and despite french majority ownership of the holding company , klm will continue to hold onto its own rights to land at foreign airports .
italy 's alitalia , already a member of the same industry grouping - skyteam - as air france , is also keen to join the party .
but even though both retain sizable state ownership , air france and klm say alitalia will have to be fully privatised and restructured before it can sign up .

after four years with the rail network he moved to consumer goods giant procter & gamble , where he worked his way up from brands manager to the post of president of global homecare in 1999 .
mr clasper then moved to the airport operator in 2001 as deputy chief executive , finally taking the post of chief executive in 2002 .
what was your first car ?
my first car was an austin maxi which i bought from my dad .
it was pretty reliable and good fun , as a first car will always be .
i have always found the morgan very attractive .
i like the retro image and its road handling must be tremendous .
what was your first job and how much were you paid ?
like most hard working boys desperate for independent financial status , i did a paper round as a youngster .
goodness knows what i was paid , but i can guarantee it was n't much !
my first full job , though , was as a sales assistant in burtons .
i was particularly good at selling shirts and ties when men came in to collect their suits .
the commission was certainly a good incentive .
what type of house did you first own ?
it was a little semi detached house in leeds and cost £ 7,600 .
i 'm sure it would have made a good investment property had i kept it .
i was proud to own my own property , but not so impressed , of course , with the costs of property ownership .
it was the first step and i had a number of very enjoyable years in leeds .
who is your biggest inspiration ?
this is a really tough one to answer .
my family have been great encouragement from university through to today .
i had some inspiring bosses throughout my career in procter & gamble and mike hodgkinson , my predecessor here at baa was a great mentor when i joined .
however , my choice would be my father .
he ran a small building firm and taught me the importance of appreciating and motivating staff in the front line of the business .
what 's the best bit of business advice you 've had ?
i spent many years in procter & gamble , and as i climbed the ladder i learnt the importance of motivating people .
a company has a wealth of assets in its staff and the key is to ensure that they meet their full potential .
the first step is to provide a clarity of purpose .
the second is a combination of skills , training and generating self confidence in your staff .
what was the proudest moment of your career ?
whilst i am a businessman and have a background in the fast moving consumer sector , i have always been aware of the impact of business on the environment and i have always pursued solutions to manage the negative impacts .
i did so at procter & gamble where we were part of a industry initiative to launch the first domestic waste recycling bins for homes in the uk .
and now at baa we are working towards including aviation in an emissions trading scheme .
along the way i was fortunate enough to be awarded the cbe and undoubtedly my proudest moment was collecting it at the palace .
baa is the world 's leading airport company with seven airports across the uk and 12 international airport contracts .
the company serves almost 200m passengers worldwide , with a total of 11,861 employees .
in 1987 the firm was successfully floated on the stock market with a capitalisation of £ 1.225bn - it is now worth around £ 54.7bn.

after four years with the rail network he moved to consumer goods giant procter & gamble , where he worked his way up from brands manager to the post of president of global homecare in 1999 .
mr clasper then moved to the airport operator in 2001 as deputy chief executive , finally taking the post of chief executive in 2002 .
what was your first car ?
my first car was an austin maxi which i bought from my dad .
it was pretty reliable and good fun , as a first car will always be .
i have always found the morgan very attractive .
i like the retro image and its road handling must be tremendous .
what was your first job and how much were you paid ?
like most hard working boys desperate for independent financial status , i did a paper round as a youngster .
goodness knows what i was paid , but i can guarantee it was n't much !
my first full job , though , was as a sales assistant in burtons .
i was particularly good at selling shirts and ties when men came in to collect their suits .
the commission was certainly a good incentive .
what type of house did you first own ?
it was a little semi detached house in leeds and cost £ 7,600 .
i 'm sure it would have made a good investment property had i kept it .
i was proud to own my own property , but not so impressed , of course , with the costs of property ownership .
it was the first step and i had a number of very enjoyable years in leeds .
who is your biggest inspiration ?
this is a really tough one to answer .
my family have been great encouragement from university through to today .
i had some inspiring bosses throughout my career in procter & gamble and mike hodgkinson , my predecessor here at baa was a great mentor when i joined .
however , my choice would be my father .
he ran a small building firm and taught me the importance of appreciating and motivating staff in the front line of the business .
what 's the best bit of business advice you 've had ?
i spent many years in procter & gamble , and as i climbed the ladder i learnt the importance of motivating people .
a company has a wealth of assets in its staff and the key is to ensure that they meet their full potential .
the first step is to provide a clarity of purpose .
the second is a combination of skills , training and generating self confidence in your staff .
what was the proudest moment of your career ?
whilst i am a businessman and have a background in the fast moving consumer sector , i have always been aware of the impact of business on the environment and i have always pursued solutions to manage the negative impacts .
i did so at procter & gamble where we were part of a industry initiative to launch the first domestic waste recycling bins for homes in the uk .
and now at baa we are working towards including aviation in an emissions trading scheme .
along the way i was fortunate enough to be awarded the cbe and undoubtedly my proudest moment was collecting it at the palace .
baa is the world 's leading airport company with seven airports across the uk and 12 international airport contracts .
the company serves almost 200m passengers worldwide , with a total of 11,861 employees .
in 1987 the firm was successfully floated on the stock market with a capitalisation of £ 1.225bn - it is now worth around £ 54.7bn.

the borough council wants to attract younger people to the town .
the council will be endorsing sports such as windsurfing and skating and promoting cosmopolitan restaurants and bars .
the campaign will also include posters being displayed on the london underground to encourage visitors .
eastbourne has long been unfairly associated with the label of a retirement home resort norman kinnish , eastbourne borough council the marketing strategy is designed to challenge the idea that only older people can find enjoyment in eastbourne .
norman kinnish , council director of economy , tourism and environment , said : " eastbourne has long been unfairly associated with the label of a retirement-home resort .
" although a firm favourite with the older generation , thanks to our clean , safe and beautiful surroundings , the town has also been steadily growing in its popularity with a more diverse range of visitors .
" as a resort which hosts the largest inline skating festival in england and the biggest free air show on the south coast , it is now time for us to challenge this antiquated stereotypical view of eastbourne and tell it how it really is . "

they died in a battle for control of public buildings in the sadr city area that had been taken over by followers of a radical shia cleric , moqtada sadr .
his supporters were involved in earlier clashes in najaf that left about 20 iraqis and two coalition soldiers dead .
dozens of his supporters occupied the governor 's office in basra on monday .
moqtada sadr is an increasingly outspoken opponent of the occupation .
recent days have seen a number of demonstrations by his followers following the arrest of one of the cleric 's top aides and the closure of his newspaper by the coalition , which said the publication was inciting anti-us violence .
people have crossed the line ...
this will not be tolerated us administrator paul bremer profile : moqtada sadr most previous attacks on coalition troops had been by fighters drawn from the sunni muslim minority - who received favourable treatment under former iraqi leader saddam hussein - rather than the majority shia .
the bbc 's barbara plett in baghdad says mr sadr 's movement is generally seen as the most radical of the shia religious movements .
she adds that a new front may have opened in the battle to pacify iraq .
two senior us congressmen have warned president george w bush 's administration that iraq faces the possibility of civil war .
the republican and democratic party leaders of the senate foreign relations committee , richard lugar and joe biden , said the us should consider postponing the handing over of sovereignty on 30 june .
stronghold dozens of men loyal to moqtada sadr - many of them armed - occupied the governor 's office in basra in a dawn raid on monday but apparently met no resistance , the bbc 's dumeetha luthra reports from the roof of the building .
policemen guarding the building appear to have taken sides with the protesters who claim they are engaged in a peaceful sit-in , our correspondent says , and there is no sign of the uk coalition forces who control iraq 's second city .
the fighting in baghdad broke out after members of a militia loyal to mr sadr took control of police stations and government buildings in sadr city , the us military said in a statement .
it said militiamen attacked the soldiers with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades in the heavily populated shia area on the eastern outskirts of the capital .
as well as the seven troops killed , at least 24 were wounded while iraqi casualties are unknown .
the baghdad fighting came hours after a march by mr sadr 's followers on a coalition force base near the holy city of najaf ended in violence .
the protest took place outside najaf 's spanish garrison where troops from el salvador and other spanish-speaking countries are also based .
it is unclear who fired first but a coalition soldier from el salvador and one from the us were killed along with about 20 iraqis .
many more were injured .
' terrorise your enemy ' following the najaf violence , a spokesman for moqtada sadr said the cleric had called for an end to protests , asking his supporters instead to gather at his offices or in mosques .
" terrorise your enemy , as we can not remain silent over its violations , " a translation of his statement said .
it was not clear whether this was an order for his followers to resort to violence .
the us administrator in iraq , paul bremer , said protesters had " crossed the line and moved to violence " .
" this will not be tolerated " , he added .

stronghold dozens of men loyal to moqtada sadr - many of them armed - occupied the governor 's office in basra in a dawn raid on monday but apparently met no resistance , the bbc 's dumeetha luthra reports from the roof of the building .
policemen guarding the building appear to have taken sides with the protesters who claim they are engaged in a peaceful sit-in , our correspondent says , and there is no sign of the uk coalition forces who control iraq 's second city .
the fighting in baghdad broke out after members of a militia loyal to mr sadr took control of police stations and government buildings in sadr city , the us military said in a statement .
it said militiamen attacked the soldiers with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades in the heavily populated shia area on the eastern outskirts of the capital .
as well as the seven troops killed , at least 24 were wounded while iraqi casualties are unknown .
the baghdad fighting came hours after a march by mr sadr 's followers on a coalition force base near the holy city of najaf ended in violence .
the protest took place outside najaf 's spanish garrison where troops from el salvador and other spanish-speaking countries are also based .
it is unclear who fired first but a coalition soldier from el salvador and one from the us were killed along with about 20 iraqis .
many more were injured .
' terrorise your enemy ' following the najaf violence , a spokesman for moqtada sadr said the cleric had called for an end to protests , asking his supporters instead to gather at his offices or in mosques .
" terrorise your enemy , as we can not remain silent over its violations , " a translation of his statement said .
it was not clear whether this was an order for his followers to resort to violence .
the us administrator in iraq , paul bremer , said protesters had " crossed the line and moved to violence " .
" this will not be tolerated " , he added .
in a separate incident on sunday , the us military said two marines had been killed in the province of al-anbar , a hotbed of anti-coalition violence .

some parts of cambridge have suffered from a recent rise in street drinking , aggressive begging and prostitution .
ian nimmo-smith , leader of cambridge city council , believes the problems can be dealt with through council by-laws .

she wants the council to talk to home office experts about concerns over the mill road area of the city .
ms campbell said : " a dppo will give police direct powers to confiscate alcohol in the areas where public drinking is a problem .
" they can also deal with other anti-social behaviour problems .
" the home office has built up experience from operation of these orders in 98 local authorities and this is at the disposal of the city council , but they have not called on the experts for help .
" the council can be assured that the orders can work effectively . "
but mr nimmo-smith said : " using a dppo to deal with the problem just moves it onto another area and we have to get another order to deal with that .

" police are now able to confiscate drink and deal with anti-social behaviour . "
some residents have told the bbc of their concerns particularly over public drinking in the mill road area .
beat officer pc mark rabel told the bbc that in the last six months he had made 120 arrests in the mill road area of cambridge and offences ranged from aggressive begging to serious sexual assault .
" our main aim is to build relationships with local people , but we have to also deal with six people who are subject to anti-social behaviour orders , " he said .

the first of the new generation , three-carriage trains , will be delivered next week from the manufacturers caf at zaragoza in northern spain .
they have been described as " the safest trains in the world " and are all expected to be operating within 12 months .
the poor reliability of northern ireland railways ' existing trains has dogged the service in recent years , with frequent breakdowns resulting in delays and cancellations .
northern ireland transport company translink said the £ 80m investment was designed to meet the needs of rail travellers over the next 30 years .
a further £ 30m is expected to be spent on parts and maintenance over the first 15 years of the trains ' operation .
the first trains will go into service on the belfast-bangor line , with roll-out across the province in the following months .
journey times are set to be cut with the new 90mph trains , which have faster start-up and braking mechanisms .
the £ 80m investment we have been able to make in rolling stock will go a long way towards improving levels of reliability and comfort , as well as the perception of rail as a modern , convenient means of transport mal mcgreevy translink take a look inside the new trains the silver and blue carriages are air-conditioned , carpeted and fitted with aircraft-style seating for up to 200 passengers per train .
they have cctv , audio announcements , wheelchair access and toilets for the disabled .
translink said it made a saving of £ 3.5m on the transaction because of the sterling-euro values .
the trains will be subjected to a rigorous testing and commissioning programme of up to 16 weeks before entering service .
' latest technical innovations ' translink general manager mal mcgreevy said the move meant 75 % of all trains were being replaced .
the company said its target was increasing rail passenger numbers by 60 % over 10 years .
" the £ 80m investment we have been able to make in rolling stock will go a long way towards improving levels of reliability and comfort , as well as the perception of rail as a modern , convenient means of transport , " said mr mcgreevy .
" every opportunity has been taken during the design period to ensure that passengers will benefit from the latest technical innovations , resulting in a smoother ride and quieter rail travel . "
the trains are the first in the world to meet stringent safety standards set by the association of train operating companies in the wake of the paddington rail disaster in london .
" we will have one of the safest trains in the british isles and within europe , " said mr mcgreevy .
" these trains will be with us for the next 20-30 years .
we have to look forward to what our passengers will expect and we have exceeded their requirements today . "
last week , a report on the future of rail travel in northern ireland said the railway service should be expanded .
the consultants behind the report also said that expanding the railway service would have social and economic benefits .
trains every 10 minutes on the bangor line in county down , and an hourly service to londonderry were just some of the highlights of what extra expenditure would bring , according to the report .

'
by stephen dowling bbc news online entertainment staff as the music world prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of kurt cobain 's death on monday , anton brookes - nirvana 's former uk press officer - remembers the band 's rise and fall .
mr brookes - who runs music pr company bad moon publicity - worked with nirvana from 1989 , when they were unknowns , to cobain 's suicide in 1994 , when they were arguably the biggest rock band in the world .
first impressions : " i first heard of them in 1989 , when their song about a girl came out on the sub pop singles club .
that 's when i first heard that track and spank thru - and to be honest i thought it was rubbish !
" but then i heard them do a cover of love buzz and it was fantastic .
they were like the beatles meets black sabbath .
" i 'd taken a journalist out from the magazine sounds to do an interview with tad -lsb- a grunge band nirvana were touring with -rsb- .
tad were much the bigger band . "
on nevermind : " he sent me a tape once , of songs that were going to be on their album nevermind , and it was taped over a copy of the band 's first album bleach .
you got to the track lithium -lsb- later one of the band 's most successful singles -rsb- and you had to turn it over halfway through .
" i always remember kurt telling me they had pop songs , and these songs were going to be top 10 songs .
back then , our idea of the ' top 10 ' was being as big as sonic youth or the pixies , or getting a gig at brixton academy and maybe selling it out . "
on their last uk gig : " when they headlined reading , i was standing on the side of the stage with my business partner , and i looked out at the audience , and there were people as far as the eye could see - just standing in the rain - covered in mud up to their knees .
" that was so special .
it was one of the best moments of my life .
it turned out to be their last uk gig .
it was amazing because as a band they had come from nothing . "
talking about cobain : " one of the reasons i like doing interviews about kurt is that it keeps it alive .
it 's nice to be able to offer another side that people do n't normally get to read about .
" it 's not kurt the voice of a generation , it 's kurt the friend , kurt the father , kurt the band member .
he was down-to-earth and a really nice guy .
he was really warm and caring , and he was very vulnerable . "
nirvana and england : " he loved coming over to england .
the band had been slogging across the us without making a dent .
over here , they were getting a lot more recognition as musicians , as a band , and they were drawing bigger crowds .
" they would come over and play a venue , and it would be full and the people would know all the words .
they were overjoyed . "
on the day kurt died : " i got the first call at 4.30 in the afternoon .
i just thought it was another ' kurt is dead ' rumour .
but you still have to speak to management , just for peace of mind .
" and it 's not the same people ringing up , it 's all the news agencies and the big tv stations and newspapers and radio .
it began as a trickle , and then the calls kept coming through : ' kurt is dead ' . "
i went home and made a little shrine out of pictures i 'd cut out of magazines " anton brookes " you 're hoping it 's an accident , or that it 's not him - please do n't let it be an overdose .
then i get a call from management .
straight away i know something is wrong because they wo n't say anything .
their manager says to me ' they 've found a body ' , but they wo n't confirm who it is .
" i 'm pacing the room , i 'm aggravated .
people are ringing me up and quite a few times i have to point out that we 're talking about a person who has a daughter and they should be a bit more caring .
" i went home and made a little shrine out of pictures i 'd cut out of magazines , and some love beads and a candle and a cross , and i had a cry with my wife .
" then i went out with phil alexander , from the rock magazine kerrang ! , and we talked about the first time we saw nirvana , and what they meant to people .
" afterwards we went to this club , and halfway through the night they played smells like teen spirit .
everybody looked at me , and i was like ' i 'm fine , i 'm fine ' .
" the record company rang me and asked me if i wanted to go to the funeral .
people were saying ' you should be there ' .
but i did n't want to get on that plane .
i did n't want to see the circus around it . "
how he feels now : " i never listen to them or read about them , i find it quite painful still .
but i get a rush when i see kids wearing nirvana t-shirts .
" i buy all the nirvana books when they come out but i do n't read them .
" but on the first day the best of came out , i was near virgin records and i went and bought it .
i went up to the display and picked it up , looked at it , took it to the counter , and paid for it .
that day i was a nirvana fan again . "

by stephen dowling bbc news online entertainment staff as the music world prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of kurt cobain 's death on monday , anton brookes - nirvana 's former uk press officer - remembers the band 's rise and fall .
nirvana 's first album was 1989 's bleach mr brookes - who runs music pr company bad moon publicity - worked with nirvana from 1989 , when they were unknowns , to cobain 's suicide in 1994 , when they were arguably the biggest rock band in the world .
first impressions : " i first heard of them in 1989 , when their song about a girl came out on the sub pop singles club .
that 's when i first heard that track and spank thru - and to be honest i thought it was rubbish !
" but then i heard them do a cover of love buzz and it was fantastic .
they were like the beatles meets black sabbath .
" i 'd taken a journalist out from the magazine sounds to do an interview with tad -lsb- a grunge band nirvana were touring with -rsb- .
tad were much the bigger band . "
on nevermind : " he sent me a tape once , of songs that were going to be on their album nevermind , and it was taped over a copy of the band 's first album bleach .
you got to the track lithium -lsb- later one of the band 's most successful singles -rsb- and you had to turn it over halfway through .
" i always remember kurt telling me they had pop songs , and these songs were going to be top 10 songs .
back then , our idea of the ' top 10 ' was being as big as sonic youth or the pixies , or getting a gig at brixton academy and maybe selling it out . "
on their last uk gig : " when they headlined reading , i was standing on the side of the stage with my business partner , and i looked out at the audience , and there were people as far as the eye could see - just standing in the rain - covered in mud up to their knees .
" that was so special .
it was one of the best moments of my life .
it turned out to be their last uk gig .
it was amazing because as a band they had come from nothing . "
cobain 's daughter frances bean -lrb- right -rrb- is now 11 talking about cobain : " one of the reasons i like doing interviews about kurt is that it keeps it alive .
it 's nice to be able to offer another side that people do n't normally get to read about .
" it 's not kurt the voice of a generation , it 's kurt the friend , kurt the father , kurt the band member .
he was down-to-earth and a really nice guy .
he was really warm and caring , and he was very vulnerable . "
nirvana and england : " he loved coming over to england .
the band had been slogging across the us without making a dent .
over here , they were getting a lot more recognition as musicians , as a band , and they were drawing bigger crowds .
" they would come over and play a venue , and it would be full and the people would know all the words .
they were overjoyed . "
on the day kurt died : " i got the first call at 4.30 in the afternoon .
i just thought it was another ' kurt is dead ' rumour .
but you still have to speak to management , just for peace of mind .
" and it 's not the same people ringing up , it 's all the news agencies and the big tv stations and newspapers and radio .
it began as a trickle , and then the calls kept coming through : ' kurt is dead ' .
i went home and made a little shrine out of pictures i 'd cut out of magazines anton brookes " you 're hoping it 's an accident , or that it 's not him - please do n't let it be an overdose .
then i get a call from management .
straight away i know something is wrong because they wo n't say anything .
their manager says to me ' they 've found a body ' , but they wo n't confirm who it is .
" i 'm pacing the room , i 'm aggravated .
people are ringing me up and quite a few times i have to point out that we 're talking about a person who has a daughter and they should be a bit more caring .
" i went home and made a little shrine out of pictures i 'd cut out of magazines , and some love beads and a candle and a cross , and i had a cry with my wife .
mr brookes finds listening to nirvana " painful " " then i went out with phil alexander , from the rock magazine kerrang ! , and we talked about the first time we saw nirvana , and what they meant to people .
" afterwards we went to this club , and halfway through the night they played smells like teen spirit .
everybody looked at me , and i was like ' i 'm fine , i 'm fine ' .
" the record company rang me and asked me if i wanted to go to the funeral .
people were saying ' you should be there ' .
but i did n't want to get on that plane .
i did n't want to see the circus around it . "
how he feels now : " i never listen to them or read about them , i find it quite painful still .
but i get a rush when i see kids wearing nirvana t-shirts .
" i buy all the nirvana books when they come out but i do n't read them .
" but on the first day the best of came out , i was near virgin records and i went and bought it .
i went up to the display and picked it up , looked at it , took it to the counter , and paid for it .

bbc news online looks at fellow rock icons who left an enduring legacy after dying in tragic circumstances .
jimi hendrix coaxed new sound out of the electric guitar , blending blues with r & b and rock over three groundbreaking albums .
his live performances - which saw hendrix play the guitar behind his back , with his teeth or even set it on fire - threatened to overshadow his achievements as a songwriter and musician .
the jimi hendrix experience 's psychedelic 1967 debut - are you experienced ? - spawned the experimental albums axis : bold as love and electric ladyland .
a shaky woodstock performance hinted at his personal problems , and hendrix died of asphyxiation after choking on his vomit on 18 september 1970 , aged 27 .
jim morrison wrote lyrics dark and intriguing enough to bring out the best in his band the doors ' psychedelic rock .
he defied the lyrical niceties of the flower power age in favour of the brooding riders on the storm and intense break on through , inspired by morrison 's regular experiments with hallucinogenic drugs .
as the doors ' fame grew , his hedonistic public image moved further away from his withdrawn , private persona - and threatened to split the band .
morrison was found dead in his bath on 3 july 1971 , the victim of an apparent heart attack .
he was 27 .
marc bolan scored his first hit with the whimsical , acoustic ride a white swan in 1970 but conquered that decade 's glam rock scene by electrifying his sound .
the androgynous londoner and his band t rex horrified parents with the lusty hot love and get it on , joining metal guru and telegram sam at the top of the singles chart .
us success proved more elusive , but with girlfriend gloria jones he created a smoother , more soulful sound to broaden his appeal .
bolan died in barnes , south-west london , on 13 september 1977 aged 29 , when the mini driven by jones crashed into a tree .
sid vicious was born john simon ritchie but renamed by john lydon when he invited the sex pistols ' fan to join the punk band in 1977 .
although he could not play his bass guitar and could not sing , preferring to spend gigs drunkenly shouting at hecklers , vicious epitomised the nihilistic energy of punk .
following the band 's ill-fated us tour , vicious performed a solo version of my way for the band 's great rock ' n ' roll swindle film .
lydon tried to separate vicious from his girlfriend and heroin addict nancy spungen , but after she was found stabbed in their new york apartment , vicious died of a heroin overdose , aged 21 , on 2 february 1979 .
freddie mercury elevated queen above the slew of traditional four-piece rock bands with his strong vocals and flamboyant onstage personality .
queen took 40 songs into the uk top 40 between 1974 and 1991 , including bohemian rhapsody , we are the champions and radio gaga .
mercury publicly stated that he had an aids-related illness on 23 november 1991 , and died one day later aged 45 .
kurt cobain compared himself to mercury in his suicide note , saying the queen frontman seemed to " relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something i totally admire and envy " .
michael hutchence and inxs became australian superstars in 1983 with third album shabooh shoobah , their radio-friendly rock enhanced by his seductive charisma .
four years later britain and the us would also fall at their feet thanks to kick , which generated the singles need you tonight , devil inside , new sensation and never tear us apart .
their success could not be sustained , however , and when elegantly wasted was released in 1997 , there was more interest in hutchence 's relationships with kylie minogue and tv host paula yates than inxs ' music .
hutchence was found hanged on 22 november that year in his sydney hotel room , aged 37 .
yates was found dead from a heroin overdose at her london home three years later .

bbc news online looks at fellow rock icons who left an enduring legacy after dying in tragic circumstances .
jimi hendrix coaxed new sound out of the electric guitar , blending blues with r & b and rock over three groundbreaking albums .
his live performances - which saw hendrix play the guitar behind his back , with his teeth or even set it on fire - threatened to overshadow his achievements as a songwriter and musician .
the jimi hendrix experience 's psychedelic 1967 debut - are you experienced ? - spawned the experimental albums axis : bold as love and electric ladyland .
a shaky woodstock performance hinted at his personal problems , and hendrix died of asphyxiation after choking on his vomit on 18 september 1970 , aged 27 .
jim morrison wrote lyrics dark and intriguing enough to bring out the best in his band the doors ' psychedelic rock .
he defied the lyrical niceties of the flower power age in favour of the brooding riders on the storm and intense break on through , inspired by morrison 's regular experiments with hallucinogenic drugs .
as the doors ' fame grew , his hedonistic public image moved further away from his withdrawn , private persona - and threatened to split the band .
morrison was found dead in his bath on 3 july 1971 , the victim of an apparent heart attack .
he was 27 .
marc bolan scored his first hit with the whimsical , acoustic ride a white swan in 1970 but conquered that decade 's glam rock scene by electrifying his sound .
the androgynous londoner and his band t rex horrified parents with the lusty hot love and get it on , joining metal guru and telegram sam at the top of the singles chart .
us success proved more elusive , but with girlfriend gloria jones he created a smoother , more soulful sound to broaden his appeal .
bolan died in barnes , south-west london , on 13 september 1977 aged 29 , when the mini driven by jones crashed into a tree .
sid vicious was born john simon ritchie but renamed by john lydon when he invited the sex pistols ' fan to join the punk band in 1977 .

bbc news online looks at fellow rock icons who left an enduring legacy after dying in tragic circumstances .
jimi hendrix coaxed new sound out of the electric guitar , blending blues with r & b and rock over three groundbreaking albums .
his live performances - which saw hendrix play the guitar behind his back , with his teeth or even set it on fire - threatened to overshadow his achievements as a songwriter and musician .
the jimi hendrix experience 's psychedelic 1967 debut - are you experienced ? - spawned the experimental albums axis : bold as love and electric ladyland .
a shaky woodstock performance hinted at his personal problems , and hendrix died of asphyxiation after choking on his vomit on 18 september 1970 , aged 27 .
jim morrison wrote lyrics dark and intriguing enough to bring out the best in his band the doors ' psychedelic rock .
he defied the lyrical niceties of the flower power age in favour of the brooding riders on the storm and intense break on through , inspired by morrison 's regular experiments with hallucinogenic drugs .
as the doors ' fame grew , his hedonistic public image moved further away from his withdrawn , private persona - and threatened to split the band .
morrison was found dead in his bath on 3 july 1971 , the victim of an apparent heart attack .
he was 27 .
marc bolan scored his first hit with the whimsical , acoustic ride a white swan in 1970 but conquered that decade 's glam rock scene by electrifying his sound .

the conservative leader will also publish labour 's telephone number as part of a poster campaign in the run up to june 's european elections .
mr howard says tony blair should let the people decide whether britain should adopt the new eu constitution .
" i believe that any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the british people in a referendum , " he said .
addressing tory delegates during the party 's conference in llandudno , he said : " whatever your view you should have a say . "
" when it comes to transferring power to brussels tony blair says ' trust me ' .
conservatives say ' trust the people ' . "
' no mandate ' the tories have already indicated that calls for a referendum on the eu constitution will be a central plank in their euro election strategy .
at a conservative-initiated debate earlier this week , shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said his party would use " every parliamentary device " to stop mr blair from railroading through an eu constitution .
the prime minister expects everyone to trust him , but he has got to learn to trust the people michael ancram he argued that labour had no mandate for the measure as it was not in the party 's manifesto .
but mr blair said he wanted agreement on the constitution " as quickly as possible " .
the prime minister said he would not surrender sovereignty on the key " red line " issues of tax , foreign policy , defence or the criminal justice system .
but the tories have argued the constitution would give the eu " many of the trappings of statehood " , including a president , a foreign minister and a new legal status .
' important decision ' mr ancram said : " tony blair keeps saying he wants to have a big conversation with the country but he is completely ignoring them over one of the biggest issues facing us today .
" the european constitution will lead to a substantial transfer of power away from britain to the eu .
" it is a very important decision and people are entitled to have their say in a referendum .
" over the next months , we will campaign to increase the pressure on tony blair and force him to listen .
" the prime minister expects everyone to trust him , but he has got to learn to trust the people . "
