private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role .

it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .

after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role .

it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .

after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .

one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .
before that , it was kuwait .
before that , vietnam . " we offered american families to go on trips , " pees said , adding that groups toured the picturesque mosel river region or went swimming together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vegas " advertises with showdancing and table dance in baumholder a few places will miss the americans even more : 70 bars in the area that offer " table dances " and " all you can drink " specials .
here , the lights will probably go out forever once the troops are gone .
it might be another reason why baumholder nights are a little crazy these days . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions .

an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 media davids vs. goliath 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameras are everywhere but only a few can use the pictures with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .
private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2004 belgian criminals try to make amends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restorative justice brings victims and criminals together a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .
victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .

but the issue could still come up during confirmation hearings in october . pressure is growing on mariann fischer boel , the danish politician recently nominated to take over as eu agriculture commissioner in november . reports about the 61-year-old 's possible conflict of interest first hit the danish papers : boel and her husband own a 204-hectare -lrb- 500-acre -rrb- farm on the danish island of funen . she inherited the farm from her grandfather , who reportedly invented danish blue cheese .
boel receives about € 60,000 -lrb- $ 74,200 -rrb- in eu agricultural subsidies yearly for growing flowers and fruit .
as agriculture commissioner , boel will oversee the distribution of more than € 40 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- in annual subsidies . no legal impediment journalists in other countries picked up the story , leading eu officials to call back lawyers from vacation for an expert opinion on the issue .
after examining the case , the lawyers concluded that there was no legal reason to bar boel from the job . " there is no incompatibility between her ownership of land and being a member of the commission , " said stefaan de rynck , a spokesman for the commission . he added that eu lawyers had also looked at boel 's efforts to distance herself from ownership of the land under danish law : while boel owns the land , her husband actually runs a company that receives income from the farm and pays its taxes , she told the commission , according to reuters news agency . a code of conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso while boel 's been exonerated legally , european commission president-designate jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- will have to deal with the issue : commissioners are required to adhere to a strict code of conduct .
side jobs - paid and unpaid - are not permitted .
commissioners also have to declare all their spouses ' interests . " that code of conduct is there to assure full transparency , to make sure that all interests are known to the public opinion , to the media , " de rynck said .
" that transparency is there to assure full independence in the exercise of -lrb- a commissioner 's -rrb- mandate - from national interest , from any company interest or personal interests . " questionable record ? until two weeks ago , boel served as denmark 's agriculture minister .
the fact that she was picked by her government as an eu commissioner has n't been welcomed by all farming experts : boel has a reputation as a supporter of large-scale farms and industrial agricultural factories , many of which already exist in denmark and the netherlands . that 's a problem for smaller farms , some eu parliamentarians fear already , according to german public broadcaster wdr . the european parliament must approve commission appointments before the new term starts on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2004 belgian criminals try to make amends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restorative justice brings victims and criminals together a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .
victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.08.2004 klinsmann era opens with victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former striker klinsmann only once forgot that he was n't playing german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .
germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .
two years is not that long to prepare .

the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .

a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .

town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
the money that could be better spent if europe acted sooner to prevent and adapt to climate change , said the european environment agency . jennifer macey -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .

even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 losing " the boys " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still here , but not for much longer the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .
one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .
before that , it was kuwait .
before that , vietnam . " we offered american families to go on trips , " pees said , adding that groups toured the picturesque mosel river region or went swimming together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vegas " advertises with showdancing and table dance in baumholder a few places will miss the americans even more : 70 bars in the area that offer " table dances " and " all you can drink " specials .
here , the lights will probably go out forever once the troops are gone .
it might be another reason why baumholder nights are a little crazy these days . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 losing " the boys " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still here , but not for much longer the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .
one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .
before that , it was kuwait .
before that , vietnam . " we offered american families to go on trips , " pees said , adding that groups toured the picturesque mosel river region or went swimming together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vegas " advertises with showdancing and table dance in baumholder a few places will miss the americans even more : 70 bars in the area that offer " table dances " and " all you can drink " specials .
here , the lights will probably go out forever once the troops are gone .
it might be another reason why baumholder nights are a little crazy these days . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 losing " the boys " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still here , but not for much longer the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .
one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
the money that could be better spent if europe acted sooner to prevent and adapt to climate change , said the european environment agency . jennifer macey -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .
germany 's zugspitze now spends most of the year undercover .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- ushering in a " new age " of renewable energy delegates from more than 150 countries on friday agreed on an ambitious action program to promote renewable energy at the close of a four-day conference in bonn .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2004 belgian criminals try to make amends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restorative justice brings victims and criminals together a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .
victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 europe heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is likely to bring more sunbaths on mountain tops according to a new report by europe 's leading environment agency , the continent only has 50 years to adapt to changing weather conditions with three-quarters of europe 's glaciers expected to melt . europe 's summer has again been hit by freak weather conditions , with heavy thunderstorms affecting several european countries .
in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
the money that could be better spent if europe acted sooner to prevent and adapt to climate change , said the european environment agency . jennifer macey -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .

i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .

after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2004 belgian criminals try to make amends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restorative justice brings victims and criminals together a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .
victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 losing " the boys " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still here , but not for much longer the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .
one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .
before that , it was kuwait .
before that , vietnam . " we offered american families to go on trips , " pees said , adding that groups toured the picturesque mosel river region or went swimming together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vegas " advertises with showdancing and table dance in baumholder a few places will miss the americans even more : 70 bars in the area that offer " table dances " and " all you can drink " specials .
here , the lights will probably go out forever once the troops are gone .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .

the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .
but we 've been broadcasting the games from the beginning without interruption .
if that were to discontinue , the press would jump on public broadcasters and ask why people should bother paying their license fees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .

one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
the money that could be better spent if europe acted sooner to prevent and adapt to climate change , said the european environment agency . jennifer macey -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.08.2004 klinsmann era opens with victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former striker klinsmann only once forgot that he was n't playing german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .
germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .

the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops .

the diw 's study said the majority of the 7.2 million registered mini-jobs are low-paid , parttime jobs that already existed before the category was introduced in april of 2003 - just with a different name .
new jobs have - for the most part - not been created as a result of the initiative , and have , therefore , not helped to bring down unemployment figures .
according to the diw , 17.4 percent of all german workers have taken a mini-job in addition to their primary job , which allows for parttime work with a tax free income of € 400 -lrb- $ 494 -rrb- per month .
however , these jobs , mainly done by women , are often unstable and badly paid . more briefs 19.08.2004 -pipe- volkswagen workers go on strike 18.08.2004 -pipe- swiss resist deutsche börse expansion 18.08.2004 -pipe- bafin looks into tui transactions 18.08.2004 -pipe- porsche sales climb 17.08.2004 -pipe- allianz makes executive pay public 17.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler sells stake in hyundai 17.08.2004 -pipe- dresdner bank germany 's second largest 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .

germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
the money that could be better spent if europe acted sooner to prevent and adapt to climate change , said the european environment agency . jennifer macey -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

but the issue could still come up during confirmation hearings in october . pressure is growing on mariann fischer boel , the danish politician recently nominated to take over as eu agriculture commissioner in november . reports about the 61-year-old 's possible conflict of interest first hit the danish papers : boel and her husband own a 204-hectare -lrb- 500-acre -rrb- farm on the danish island of funen . she inherited the farm from her grandfather , who reportedly invented danish blue cheese .
boel receives about € 60,000 -lrb- $ 74,200 -rrb- in eu agricultural subsidies yearly for growing flowers and fruit .
as agriculture commissioner , boel will oversee the distribution of more than € 40 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- in annual subsidies . no legal impediment journalists in other countries picked up the story , leading eu officials to call back lawyers from vacation for an expert opinion on the issue .
after examining the case , the lawyers concluded that there was no legal reason to bar boel from the job . " there is no incompatibility between her ownership of land and being a member of the commission , " said stefaan de rynck , a spokesman for the commission . he added that eu lawyers had also looked at boel 's efforts to distance herself from ownership of the land under danish law : while boel owns the land , her husband actually runs a company that receives income from the farm and pays its taxes , she told the commission , according to reuters news agency . a code of conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso while boel 's been exonerated legally , european commission president-designate jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- will have to deal with the issue : commissioners are required to adhere to a strict code of conduct .
side jobs - paid and unpaid - are not permitted .
commissioners also have to declare all their spouses ' interests . " that code of conduct is there to assure full transparency , to make sure that all interests are known to the public opinion , to the media , " de rynck said .
" that transparency is there to assure full independence in the exercise of -lrb- a commissioner 's -rrb- mandate - from national interest , from any company interest or personal interests . " questionable record ? until two weeks ago , boel served as denmark 's agriculture minister .
the fact that she was picked by her government as an eu commissioner has n't been welcomed by all farming experts : boel has a reputation as a supporter of large-scale farms and industrial agricultural factories , many of which already exist in denmark and the netherlands . that 's a problem for smaller farms , some eu parliamentarians fear already , according to german public broadcaster wdr . the european parliament must approve commission appointments before the new term starts on nov .

the paper said investigators for the diocese of metz have been combing through the life of the french politician to see whether he merits the title of " blessed robert " - the first step to sainthood .
however , the metz investigators have so far found no evidence of miracles - a prerequisite for beatification .
" all we have is the construction of europe after the war and rome does not accept that as a real miracle , " said jean moes , the leader of the enquiry .
schuman was known as the founder of the eu after his " schuman plan " became the basis of the european steel and coal community , which seven years later became the european community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.08.2004 klinsmann era opens with victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former striker klinsmann only once forgot that he was n't playing german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .
germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 media davids vs. goliath 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameras are everywhere but only a few can use the pictures with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .
private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .
but we 've been broadcasting the games from the beginning without interruption .
if that were to discontinue , the press would jump on public broadcasters and ask why people should bother paying their license fees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2004 belgian criminals try to make amends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restorative justice brings victims and criminals together a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .
victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .

victims say it helps them find closure , experts hope it will put off repeat offenders . though the idea may seem unimaginable to some , at an increasing number of european prisons , victims are meeting their offenders .
the encounters are part of a growing movement in the social justice system called restorative justice .
the process seeks to heel wounds by allowing victims to discuss the crime and its aftermath with their offenders and giving criminals a chance to make amends . having started in the united states in the 1970s , the idea is taking root in europe .
since 2000 , belgium 's progressive legal system has integrated restorative justice programs into the structure of every belgian prison .
as a result its success , pilot schemes have been implemented in germany , the netherlands and the uk . on a practical level , restorative justice means victims can confront their offenders and vice versa - if both parties agree to do so .
with a mediator always present , they can opt for a face to face meeting or seek contact through letters .
the coordinators of the program in belgium hope the process will change prison culture and the way offenders and victims think about crime . taking the first steps towards healing john is in leuven prison in belgium for serial rape . he decided he wanted to start mediation with his victims as part of belgian ’ s new restorative justice scheme , but he was not entirely prepared for the way it would make him feel .
after he heard from a mediator how one of his victims felt , he began to have panic attacks . " she told me about the emotions of my victim , which was very overwhelming , " he told dw-radio .
" i had a kind of hyperventilation because i couldn ’ t deal with what i had done .
it was the first time i was confronted with the harm i had caused , and it ’ s something i have to deal with . " ' elaina ' was the only one of the three of john ’ s victims to agree to mediation . she feels that her recovery has been helped by understanding her attacker . " i asked him to write a letter to me and it was full of ' i ' this and ' i ' that , " she said .
" i marked all the ' i ' bits and sent it back and said ' you are a selfish person . '
he was very angry with that . through mediation you learn a lot about the person and you catch the weak points .
the moment i heard he was scared was the point i felt totally comfortable , because psychologically i felt very strong . ” changing the system ivo aertsen from leuven university is one of belgian ’ s pioneering academics in the field .
he is convinced that restorative justice will change the way we view justice in western society . aertsen contends that the criminal justice system is too heavily focused on the offender - on collecting evidence , prosecuting and sentencing .
in his opinion , it 's all about the offender , while the victim - to whom the system also has a responsibility - is forgotten .
through restorative justice , victims can find answers and a sense of closure .
" we should believe in the capacity of victims and offenders to talk to each other , " aertsen said . he pointed to the dutroux case in belgium as an example . one of the fathers told a journalist what was most important for him : he wanted to know what really happened to his daughter in the very last moments before she was killed .
" these are very fundamental questions that are a way to cope with the trauma , and for these questions victims often don ’ t find sufficient answers at the trial , " aertsen said . the process also has an affect on the offender .
" i do believe that mediation is an eye opener , " kristel butinx , the restorative justice mediator between john and elaina , said .
" i once had mediation with guy who wanted to conduct a robbery but needed a car , so he went hitch-hiking , stopped some guy and killed him .
the mediation with the victim 's father was very difficult for him because he saw all the pain .
the father told stories about how his son lived and all about his hobbies so the offender would understand that he had killed not just something , but somebody . " some skeptical of criminal 's motives belgium is the first country in europe to have restorative justice schemes running in every prison , and the feedback from participants has been mostly positive .
nonetheless , hilde guffens , a restorative justice coordinator for the flanders region , has had to address fears from victim support groups who worry offenders are only participating to reduce their sentence . " if an offender wants to have a mediation with his victim , it ’ s not something people think is normal , " she said .
" they always ask what he has to gain from it . " according to guffens , the offender does stand to gain , and it ’ s important to be realistic and clear about that - to show it to the victim and leave the decision up to them . as for whether or not such programs help to reduce re-offending - the project is too new in belgium to draw any conclusions . in the case of john , he hopes mediation has helped him understand why he did what he did and will stop him from offending again . " i have done something very wrong and i take responsibility , " he said .
" i was not convinced -lrb- about mediation -rrb- in the beginning .
i was just doing it for elaina and not for my own sake .
but now i am convinced that it has helped me .
for one thing , i am sure i will never want to harm someone like that again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.08.2004 klinsmann era opens with victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former striker klinsmann only once forgot that he was n't playing german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .
germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .
but we 've been broadcasting the games from the beginning without interruption .
if that were to discontinue , the press would jump on public broadcasters and ask why people should bother paying their license fees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .
but we 've been broadcasting the games from the beginning without interruption .
if that were to discontinue , the press would jump on public broadcasters and ask why people should bother paying their license fees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .
and with public broadcasters airing different events on up to eight different channels in germany , krause said he did n't think audiences would even turn to private broadcasters for supplementary coverage .
but given the opportunity , he says dsf would give more airtime to athens .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.08.2004 klinsmann era opens with victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former striker klinsmann only once forgot that he was n't playing german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .
germany , and kevin kuranyi specifically , disposed of austria 3-1 in vienna on wednesday . german manager jürgen klinsmann started his managerial career with a 3-1 friendly win over austria here on wednesday as he bids to rebuild confidence after the euro 2004 fiasco . a first ever international hat-trick from vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi ensured germany victory over their neighbors in what new germany coach jürgen klinsmann hopes is the first step towards success in the 2006 world cup on home soil . " to win the first match is a bonus , " enthused klinsmann .
" i was nervous and excited but i have to get used to that .
i am delighted with the way my players approached this match . " with no club coaching experience to call upon , 1990 world cup winner klinsmann , 40 , took up an unfamiliar place in the dug-out alongside assistants joachim loew and oliver bierhoff . the trio was quickly on their feet to celebrate as kuranyi latched on to an exquisite pass from michael ballack - an inspiration in his first match as captain - to slot home just 96 seconds into the match . " michael ballack led the team brilliantly , " lauded klinsmann .
" he is a world class player and will grow into the role . " the lead was short-lived as austria leveled in the 10th minute with rene amerhauser unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive that left oliver kahn with no chance . asamoah 's return lauded schalke 04 front-man gerald asamoah - back after two years in the wilderness - went close to restoring germany 's lead on 17 minutes but his lob landed on top of the net .
it was one of many indications that the germans had been addressing the offensive problems that had led to a goal-starved euro 2004 campaign . germany carved open the better chances but things were less assured at the back .
the new central defensive pairing of werder bremen debutant frank fahrenhorst and bayern munich 's thomas linke looked fragile at times . kuranyi hat-trick delights coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann congratulates scorer kevin kuranyi .
after the interval , klinsmann 's troops stepped up the tempo and with 61 minutes on the clock kuranyi struck again leaping highest to bullet a header into the bottom corner .
the brazilian-born attacker , 22 , then sealed his hat-trick on 73 minutes after austrian goalkeeper thomas mandl fumbled a long ball into his path .
" everything went according to plan , " said kuranyi .
" the manager put his faith in me and i repaid it with three goals . " chelsea defender robert huth celebrated his 20th birthday with his international bow five minutes from time as klinsmann underlined his emphasis on giving youth a chance .
brazil are germany 's next opponents on september 8 in berlin and it will be interesting to see whether klinsmann recalls some of the more recognized stars for the clash with the world cup holders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain michael ballack .
despite the win new skipper ballack , 27 , insisted germany have to improve considerably if they are to be touted as contenders for the 2006 world cup .
" it was a new beginning with a new coach , " explained ballack .
" but we still have an inexperienced team and a lot of work in front of us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2004 losing " the boys " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still here , but not for much longer the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .
one place likely to be hit especially hard is the town of baumholder in southwestern germany . checking out the local newspaper , it doesn ’ t look like there 's much going on in baumholder . " three side mirrors bent again , " is one of the headlines .
the story does n't list any suspects and certainly does n't mention the possibility that us soldiers might have been responsible - despite the fact that recently they 've been going a little wild . no one is afraid of the americans , who , with 13,000 people , make up the town 's majority - the base has the largest concentration of combat arms soldiers outside the mainland united states . instead , most of baumholder 's 5,000 german residents are willing to show some leniency towards the young troops . " the boys have been gone for a whole year and were under a lot of stress , " dimitri panciera , the junior boss of baumholder 's ice cream parlor , told deutsche welle .
" they 're happy to be in a safe place .
i 'm used to things getting a little crazy here at night . " welcoming back " the boys " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " welcome home " banner across one of baumholder 's streets " the boys " have been in iraq , 5,500 of them , and they just returned a short while ago after a year without alcohol , a year without women , a year of constant danger for their lives .
a few " welcome home " banners can still be found hanging across the streets . now us president george w. bush wants to withdraw " the boys " who stroll along baumholder 's kennedy avenue and do n't look at all like the " fighting machines " people see on television - even when they 're wearing their camouflage gear . baumholders are worried : they 've heard reports that the withdrawal is supposed to take a decade , but no one 's willing to believe that .
panciera says he 'll probably have to downsize the family business . but of course he 'd prefer the troops to stay . " it 's better if they 're here and make a little noise at night than nothing happening here at all , " he said . a catastrophe volkmar pees , who has served as mayor of an association of towns including baumholder for 24 years , seemed a little more pessimistic . " it would be a catastrophe if the americans would leave without a replacement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " corner pub " is one of many bars catering to the americans in the area but where should the replacement come from ?
town officials have already contacted the german military .
but the bundeswehr is also closing down bases and wo n't be able to fill the barracks and apartments that the americans will leave behind . another major issue is the loss of jobs : 600 germans work on the base .
attracting businesses is not an easy thing in this part of the country , especially not as germany is still struggling to escape an economic downturn , pees said . that 's why the community has to face up to the fact that it will lose about € 20 million -lrb- $ 24.7 million -rrb- in annual revenue .
that 's how much the americans spend right now . losing friends but money is n't the only issue , pees said .
friendships have developed over the years and the germans worried along with american families about the spouses , parents and friends in iraq .
before that , it was kuwait .
before that , vietnam . " we offered american families to go on trips , " pees said , adding that groups toured the picturesque mosel river region or went swimming together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vegas " advertises with showdancing and table dance in baumholder a few places will miss the americans even more : 70 bars in the area that offer " table dances " and " all you can drink " specials .
here , the lights will probably go out forever once the troops are gone .

in cornwall , on britain 's western coast , floods caused buildings to collapse , while in southern france four people drowned after a sudden change in the weather led to powerful winds and massive waves .
and these types of weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as the climate continues to change , according to a report published wednesday by the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- . " it 's saying that we still need to have action according to -lrb- the kyoto protocol -rrb- , we still need to have action at the national and european level , " professor jacqueline mcglade , eea executive director told dw-radio .
" we 're saying we now know enough to be able to act , and act we must , " she warned . the report says that as a result of climate change europe is warming faster than the global average .
scientists say global warming , which is due to the increased emissions of greenhouses gases , like carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere , leads to an increase in extreme weather events like the devastating heat wave across europe last summer and the mass flooding the summer before that .
europe must adapt while the agency strongly supports international moves to mitigate global warming like the kyoto protocol , it is now for the first time calling on countries to adapt to extreme weather events like flooding at the same time as reducing their greenhouse gas emissions . " it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .

" it 's not simply now a case of building flood defenses to meet an event that might have a one in 100 year chance of happening , professor mcglade explained .
" these are now not only going to occur more frequently , but also perhaps come in a more intense way .
that means we need a very coherent strategy , both across europe and at regional and local levels , so that people can anticipate what to do under those conditions . "
an integrated approach the report also predicts that by 2050 three-quarters of the europe 's main glaciers in the swiss alps will melt .
the european environment agency says that climate change will not have an isolated impact on one area of the continent and that countries will have to take a more integrated approach on how to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapt to the impact of a warmer climate . " when we talk about the transport infrastructure , we need to think about fuels - in particular , what kind of transport , what kind of fuels - and set ourselves targets for renewable energy , and within that creating a target for biomass or conversion to bio-fuels , " mcglade said .
" we ca n't look in isolation at transport , -lrb- but also -rrb- where we place the transport infrastructure . " the floods in summer 2002 killed around 80 people and led to widespread damage .
the heat wave the following summer led to over 20,000 deaths and caused severe crop failure .
combined , this cost european countries some € 20 billion -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .

but the issue could still come up during confirmation hearings in october . pressure is growing on mariann fischer boel , the danish politician recently nominated to take over as eu agriculture commissioner in november . reports about the 61-year-old 's possible conflict of interest first hit the danish papers : boel and her husband own a 204-hectare -lrb- 500-acre -rrb- farm on the danish island of funen . she inherited the farm from her grandfather , who reportedly invented danish blue cheese .
boel receives about € 60,000 -lrb- $ 74,200 -rrb- in eu agricultural subsidies yearly for growing flowers and fruit .
as agriculture commissioner , boel will oversee the distribution of more than € 40 billion -lrb- $ 49 billion -rrb- in annual subsidies . no legal impediment journalists in other countries picked up the story , leading eu officials to call back lawyers from vacation for an expert opinion on the issue .
after examining the case , the lawyers concluded that there was no legal reason to bar boel from the job . " there is no incompatibility between her ownership of land and being a member of the commission , " said stefaan de rynck , a spokesman for the commission . he added that eu lawyers had also looked at boel 's efforts to distance herself from ownership of the land under danish law : while boel owns the land , her husband actually runs a company that receives income from the farm and pays its taxes , she told the commission , according to reuters news agency . a code of conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso while boel 's been exonerated legally , european commission president-designate jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- will have to deal with the issue : commissioners are required to adhere to a strict code of conduct .

private broadcasters claim it has shut them out of the market . a lot has changed since the olympics in rome were first fully televised in 1960 .
today , bidding for the exclusive broadcast rights has become a billion euro international business that pits public broadcasters against private broadcasters as each compete to land the premier global sporting event .
in the united states , the olympic games are almost exclusively the domain of private broadcasters , which have deeper pockets than public broadcasters , which rely on paltry government funding and desperate telephone pledge drives to attract donors .
but in europe , where public broadcasting is funded by hefty and mandatory television licensing fees for all residents , broadcasters like germany 's ard and zdf or britain 's bbc have an unmatchable arsenal when it comes to fighting for the rights to the olympics .
it 's an advantage that angers private broadcasters , who say they are virtually locked out .
" it 's not fair at all , " said jörg krause , spokesman for the private german sports broadcaster dsf .
" the situation is made worse by the fact that ard is now buying up the rights to all of the ' a ' and ' b ' category sporting events .
they 're able to finance this through the licensing fee and selling advertisements like private companies .
there 's no clear division there . "
in other words , public broadcasters not only compete for advertising euros with private broadcasters but they also have a guaranteed budget that comes from fees they legally require of all residents of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosts for zdf 's olympic coverage with their war chest of cash , ard and zdf have snapped up the rights to most of the major european sporting events this year - including the euro 2004 european soccer championships , the tour de france , the olympic games and the start of the bundesliga season .
but krause said prohibitively high olympic licensing fees make it virtually impossible for europe 's private broadcasters to make a serious bid .
but he also concedes private companies would never be able to recover the amount of money spent on the fees .
unlike the us , where private broadcasters enjoy the highest ratings and all the advertising revenues -lrb- pbs is prohibited from selling commercial advertising -rrb- , public broadcasters consistently score the highest ratings , with their only serious private competition coming from rtl , which peddles such fare as big brother to viewers .
the problem lies largely in the fact that the licensing fees have been pushed so high that advertising and sponsorship agreements are n't enough to recover the costs .
for the public broadcasters , which draw in about € 7 billion a year in licensing fees , hundreds of millions in licensing fees poses few problems .
but for private broadcasters , who in germany draw a combined € 4 billion in advertising annually , three-digit million licensing fees represent a massive strain on bottom lines .
by pushing up the prices of licenses in bidding , the public broadcasters " basically buy us out of the market , " said hartmut schultz of the german association of private broadcasters .
europeans pay € 394 million for athens historically , olympic broadcasting rights for just about the entire continent have been negotiated by the european broadcasting union , an alliance of public broadcasters that is also responsible for the wildly popular eurovision song contest .
this year , the organization paid € 394 million for the rights to athens games .
ebu 's director of legal affairs , werner rumphorst , defends the sums of money paid by public broadcasters for the right to air the olympics ' golden moments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the official olympic mascots , athene , sits in front of the olympic rings " we 've been getting these attacks from commercial broadcasters for ages , " he said .
" they claim we have what they call ' double funding , ' but the reality is that we have mixed funding .
double implies you have twice as much as you need .
overall , the funding is there to allow public broadcasting to fill its public broadcast remit , which is checked by various independent bodies . "
rumphorst noted that many complaints have been filed by private broadcasters against public behemoths , but that all of the cases have been thrown out in brussels except one .
" there is no substance to the claims , " he said .
most of the sports at the olympics are smaller events , like canoeing or archery , and ultimately draw few viewers .
they lack the draw of big ticket sporting events like pro soccer or formula one racing , whose licenses are largely in the hands of the privates .
in other words , according to rumphorst 's argument , the publics take the sports the privates wo n't touch .
but the private broadcasting association 's schultz questioned ebu 's position .
he noted that dsf regularly broadcasts the less-popular games of germany 's bundesliga second league as well as other sports that are less commercially viable than big ticket events like the tour de france or the bundesliga .
he also questioned the role of sports in the public broadcasting mandate .
public broadcasting , he said , has a mandate to show programs that promote " political and educational " public dialogue - the kinds of programming that would be un-economical for private broadcasters .
" there is no reason why -lrb- broadcasting -rrb- a big entertainment program like the olympics should be paid for by the public , " schultz said .

" ratings for the olympics are quite modest and in many cases the commercial broadcasters do n't want them .
but we 've been broadcasting the games from the beginning without interruption .
if that were to discontinue , the press would jump on public broadcasters and ask why people should bother paying their license fees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge besides , the money from the licensing fees is needed to keep the games running , he said .
the hundreds of millions in fees do n't just go to ioc salaries - they also go to funding the games themselves , international sports federations and to some of the teams from poorer countries who could n't compete in the games without the financial aid .
" these sports are only shown on public broadcasting , they 're not football or formula one racing - events we have nothing to do with , since they 're in the hands of private broadcasters , " rumphorst said .
he also noted that german public broadcasters have also failed in some of their bids to land major sporting events - including the 2002 and 2006 world cup football matches .
fair use ?
public broadcasting goliaths are n't the only hurdle in the way of the privates : they must also navigate the byzantine media rules enforced by the international olympic committee .
ioc strictly regulates how much coverage television and radio stations that have n't licensed the rights can give to the olympics .
images or sound from the olympics can only be broadcast in news programs that are not promoted as olympic specials and it ca n't appear more than three times in one day .
nor can the amount of image or sound material included in a news program exceed two minutes .
the maximum limit for using sound or images from a single olympic event is 30 seconds .
those broadcasters that do provide the brief olympic coverage are also banned by the ioc from carrying advertising during the program with any apparent link to the olympic games .
even if it did n't include the olympic logo or rings or any mention of the games , an image of a gymnast mounting a balance beam could be deemed a violation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ard tv camera at a german soccer stadium combined with their inability to acquire a broadcasting license and the stringent limitations placed upon them afterwards , many private broadcasters do n't even bother with the olympics .
" it 's not exactly a new thing for us that we ca n't do much with the olympics , " krause said .

of the 137 babies who died during a two-year period , the majority had brain damage which occurred during pregnancy , according to researchers .
but the study failed to identify anything in the mothers , or during the pregnancy and labour , which could have predicted problems with the babies .
the findings have been hailed as an important breakthrough .
the research , which involved paediatricians , obstetricians and pathologists from across the country , was led by professor neil mcintosh of edinburgh university .
he said : " this study shows that in 36 % of babies born early and in 61 % of those born at term , there is evidence of significant brain damage that had clearly happened before labour began .
" this is far more common in infants born in an asphyxiated or suffocated condition . "
" it 's important for the parents to know they have done nothing wrong , but it 's also important for staff to know that too " prof mcintosh the study included detailed examinations on the brains of about two-thirds of the 137 babies involved .
professor mcintosh said the research showed that all the full-term infants who had symptoms of asphyxiation and who then went on to have brain problems had evidence of pre-existing damage .
more than half the premature babies born with features of asphyxia also had evidence of earlier damage .
professor mcintosh , who is also a neonatal consultant with nhs lothian university hospitals division , said the findings would reassure parents and medical staff who often felt guilt following the death of a new baby .
" it means that mothers have n't delayed in coming in with any potential problems and can not feel guilty , and it means the staff have n't messed it up , " he said .
" it 's important for the parents to know they have done nothing wrong , but it 's also important for the staff to know that too . "
' reassuring findings ' he said the findings could also reduce legal actions taken against doctors and midwives for perceived mismanagement of pregnancy and labour .
during the study parents were asked to complete " highly detailed " questionnaires giving information on a wide range of aspects of their lives , background and pregnancy .
professor mcintosh said : " we could n't find anything in the questionnaire that would lead us to predict the baby would be damaged .
" it is reassuring that nothing has been identified that says parents are being silly or staff are mismanaging things . "
professor mcintosh said more tests needed to be developed in order to spot potential problems earlier in the pregnancy .
" in about 10 % of cases of a baby being born asphyxiated there 's a reason , but in 90 % there 's not .
" we intend that this study will lead to more research into the monitoring of pregnancies . "
the study was funded by the chief scientist office and by the reproductive health charity wellbeing .
shirley farmer , director of wellbeing , welcomed the findings .
she said : " the results of these investigations signpost the direction for further research and will help shape the way in which pregnant women are cared for in the future . "

of the 137 babies who died during a two-year period , the majority had brain damage which occurred during pregnancy , according to researchers .
but the study failed to identify anything in the mothers , or during the pregnancy and labour , which could have predicted problems with the babies .
the findings have been hailed as an important breakthrough .
the research , which involved paediatricians , obstetricians and pathologists from across the country , was led by professor neil mcintosh of edinburgh university .
he said : " this study shows that in 36 % of babies born early and in 61 % of those born at term , there is evidence of significant brain damage that had clearly happened before labour began .
" this is far more common in infants born in an asphyxiated or suffocated condition . "
it 's important for the parents to know they have done nothing wrong , but it 's also important for staff to know that too prof mcintosh the study included detailed examinations on the brains of about two-thirds of the 137 babies involved .
professor mcintosh said the research showed that all the full-term infants who had symptoms of asphyxiation and who then went on to have brain problems had evidence of pre-existing damage .
more than half the premature babies born with features of asphyxia also had evidence of earlier damage .

dr colm o 'mahony said access to services in the region was " poor " .
people in the area have to travel miles for treatment and wait up to three weeks to be seen , he added .
officials say they have opened a clinic in builth wells and the welsh assembly government said access to treatment was being looked at in a review . "
it tends to be those people aged between 16 and 22 who have just come back from an ibiza-style holiday who suffer " dr colm o 'mahony dr o 'mahony , a sexual diseases consultant at the countess of chester hospital , explained that access to services for stis across the uk was the " worst ever in the history of sexual illnesses . "
" people in mid wales have to travel huge distances and too far for treatment , although there is a clinic in aberystwyth , " he added .
" but if anyone in wales , or the rest of the uk , phoned for an appointment they would , on average , be expected to wait at least two to three weeks for treatment . "
the number of stis in england , wales and northern ireland rose by 4 % last year .
last month , the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said cases of chlamydia - the most common sexually transmitted infection - jumped by 9 % .
dr o 'mahony , former chairman of the association for genito-urinary medicine , said the infections and diseases were " at epidemic levels " in the uk .
" it tends to be those people aged between 16 and 22 who have just come back from an ibiza-style holiday who suffer , " he said .
" and it 's more dangerous having unprotected sex abroad than it is in the uk . "
dr o 'mahony will speak about stis at a major rural gps ' conference in powys at gregynog , near newtown , which runs from 29 september to 1 october .
" a sexual strategy has been introduced in wales and the rest of the uk , but it 's been backed up with very little money , " he added .
" it 's had little or no impact on clinics and the amount of people they see which is enormous .
" the waiting times are ridiculously high , although the service people receive once they 're seen is excellent . "
powys local health board said it had recently opened a clinic dealing with sexual health at builth wells .
there is another in neighbouring ceredigion in aberystwyth .
the welsh assembly government said the figures for stis in wales were of concern .
" over the last three years we have provided £ 1.7m for local sexual health initiatives which include sexual health outreach work , young peoples clinics and community education projects , " said an assembly spokeswoman .
" we are also making condoms more accessible to those most vulnerable to stis with eight schemes being funded across wales .
