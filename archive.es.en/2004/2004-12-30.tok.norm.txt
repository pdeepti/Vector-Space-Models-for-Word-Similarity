while the berlin film festival in february marked a triumphant return to form for the german film industry and the capital 's seven-month moma exhibition went down in history as europe 's most successful exhibition ever , the fire in late summer at the anna amalia library in weimar wreaked havoc on one of the country 's most outstanding cultural treasures .
berlin might have been basking in its new-found glory as a breeding ground for cutting-edge art and fashion , but its hip reputation did n't translate into profits . amid much discussion about radio quotas to boost home-grown pop , the german music industry pinned its hopes of recovery on popkomm , one of the many international trade fairs to relocate to berlin in 2004 .
in autumn , the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall served as reminder that reunification is still a very touchy subject - while a visit from britain 's queen elisabeth in november unearthed some even older resentments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .

while the berlin film festival in february marked a triumphant return to form for the german film industry and the capital 's seven-month moma exhibition went down in history as europe 's most successful exhibition ever , the fire in late summer at the anna amalia library in weimar wreaked havoc on one of the country 's most outstanding cultural treasures .
berlin might have been basking in its new-found glory as a breeding ground for cutting-edge art and fashion , but its hip reputation did n't translate into profits . amid much discussion about radio quotas to boost home-grown pop , the german music industry pinned its hopes of recovery on popkomm , one of the many international trade fairs to relocate to berlin in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.12.2004 eu prepares for massive aid operation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for help the eu has pledged millions in aid for the victims of the indian ocean disaster .
the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .
he said a part of the reconstruction effort could be setting up an early warning system , built with european assistance . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .
" fairness is what will benefit our children and children 's children and help preserve the welfare state , " he said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .
he said a part of the reconstruction effort could be setting up an early warning system , built with european assistance . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .

" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations .

they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .

patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .

eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors .

the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .
" fairness is what will benefit our children and children 's children and help preserve the welfare state , " he said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .
he said a part of the reconstruction effort could be setting up an early warning system , built with european assistance . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?

a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .

at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .

projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .

the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .

at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .

sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .

" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .

a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .
" fairness is what will benefit our children and children 's children and help preserve the welfare state , " he said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .

german companies employ around 200,000 staff members in the affected countries , while investments in the region total around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
among the german companies each pledging € 1 million on wednesday were deutsche telekom , daimlerchrysler , and the financial consultancy deutsche vermögensberatung . the country 's main economic associations - led by the german asia pacific committee - issued the call for donations in collaboration with the business daily , handelsblatt .
the head of the committee , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , said it was " only natural that we help our partner countries during this emergency . " " immediate , unbureaucratic aid " " siemens has been very active in this region for many years , and dr. von pierer 's appeal was for immediate , unbureaucratic aid , " siemens spokesman georg haux said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" siemens is organizing help through its subsidiaries in the affected region .
there are already hundreds of siemens employees at work , rebuilding destroyed infrastructure , getting telephone and power lines working again , and making sure medical equipment is getting to the hospitals that need it . " deutsche telekom has chosen to give its € 1 million to the aid organization deutschland hilft , company spokesman hans ehnert told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of germany 's foreign ministry coordinate aid in the crisis center of the german foreign ministry " we 're transferring the money to deutschland hilft , which is an umbrella organization for several aid organizations that have a lot of experience helping in international catastrophes , " he said .
" we 're in touch with our offices in the region , for example , our office in bangkok , so we can hear from people who are there , how things are looking , and where more concrete help is needed . " clothing chain c & a donated € 250,000 to the children 's aid organization terre des hommes . " terre des hommes is carrying out first aid in the region , they 've already built up emergency shelters for 35,000 people , most of them children , " said c & a spokesman knut brüggemann . frustration growing other german firms , including deutsche post , deutsche bank , lufthansa , and pharmaceutical concerns such as merck and schering are organizing aid to the tsunami-hit areas , though aid workers in the region face a difficult battle . relief organizations , braced for the one of the biggest humanitarian exercises in history , said needs were even greater than at first thought . the united nations admitted that only a fraction of the aid has yet got to where it is most needed . " we are doing very little at the moment , " said un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland .
" it will take maybe 48 to 72 hours more to be able to respond to the tens of thousands of people who would like to have assistance today - or yesterday , rather .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .

german companies employ around 200,000 staff members in the affected countries , while investments in the region total around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
among the german companies each pledging € 1 million on wednesday were deutsche telekom , daimlerchrysler , and the financial consultancy deutsche vermögensberatung . the country 's main economic associations - led by the german asia pacific committee - issued the call for donations in collaboration with the business daily , handelsblatt .
the head of the committee , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , said it was " only natural that we help our partner countries during this emergency . " " immediate , unbureaucratic aid " " siemens has been very active in this region for many years , and dr. von pierer 's appeal was for immediate , unbureaucratic aid , " siemens spokesman georg haux said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" siemens is organizing help through its subsidiaries in the affected region .
there are already hundreds of siemens employees at work , rebuilding destroyed infrastructure , getting telephone and power lines working again , and making sure medical equipment is getting to the hospitals that need it . " deutsche telekom has chosen to give its € 1 million to the aid organization deutschland hilft , company spokesman hans ehnert told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of germany 's foreign ministry coordinate aid in the crisis center of the german foreign ministry " we 're transferring the money to deutschland hilft , which is an umbrella organization for several aid organizations that have a lot of experience helping in international catastrophes , " he said .
" we 're in touch with our offices in the region , for example , our office in bangkok , so we can hear from people who are there , how things are looking , and where more concrete help is needed . " clothing chain c & a donated € 250,000 to the children 's aid organization terre des hommes . " terre des hommes is carrying out first aid in the region , they 've already built up emergency shelters for 35,000 people , most of them children , " said c & a spokesman knut brüggemann . frustration growing other german firms , including deutsche post , deutsche bank , lufthansa , and pharmaceutical concerns such as merck and schering are organizing aid to the tsunami-hit areas , though aid workers in the region face a difficult battle . relief organizations , braced for the one of the biggest humanitarian exercises in history , said needs were even greater than at first thought . the united nations admitted that only a fraction of the aid has yet got to where it is most needed . " we are doing very little at the moment , " said un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland .
" it will take maybe 48 to 72 hours more to be able to respond to the tens of thousands of people who would like to have assistance today - or yesterday , rather .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .

the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .

the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .

at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .

such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.12.2004 eu prepares for massive aid operation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for help the eu has pledged millions in aid for the victims of the indian ocean disaster .
the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .
he said a part of the reconstruction effort could be setting up an early warning system , built with european assistance . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .

" in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.12.2004 eu prepares for massive aid operation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for help the eu has pledged millions in aid for the victims of the indian ocean disaster .
the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .

german companies employ around 200,000 staff members in the affected countries , while investments in the region total around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
among the german companies each pledging € 1 million on wednesday were deutsche telekom , daimlerchrysler , and the financial consultancy deutsche vermögensberatung . the country 's main economic associations - led by the german asia pacific committee - issued the call for donations in collaboration with the business daily , handelsblatt .
the head of the committee , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , said it was " only natural that we help our partner countries during this emergency . " " immediate , unbureaucratic aid " " siemens has been very active in this region for many years , and dr. von pierer 's appeal was for immediate , unbureaucratic aid , " siemens spokesman georg haux said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" siemens is organizing help through its subsidiaries in the affected region .
there are already hundreds of siemens employees at work , rebuilding destroyed infrastructure , getting telephone and power lines working again , and making sure medical equipment is getting to the hospitals that need it .

" clothing chain c & a donated € 250,000 to the children 's aid organization terre des hommes . " terre des hommes is carrying out first aid in the region , they 've already built up emergency shelters for 35,000 people , most of them children , " said c & a spokesman knut brüggemann . frustration growing other german firms , including deutsche post , deutsche bank , lufthansa , and pharmaceutical concerns such as merck and schering are organizing aid to the tsunami-hit areas , though aid workers in the region face a difficult battle . relief organizations , braced for the one of the biggest humanitarian exercises in history , said needs were even greater than at first thought . the united nations admitted that only a fraction of the aid has yet got to where it is most needed . " we are doing very little at the moment , " said un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland .
" it will take maybe 48 to 72 hours more to be able to respond to the tens of thousands of people who would like to have assistance today - or yesterday , rather .

while the berlin film festival in february marked a triumphant return to form for the german film industry and the capital 's seven-month moma exhibition went down in history as europe 's most successful exhibition ever , the fire in late summer at the anna amalia library in weimar wreaked havoc on one of the country 's most outstanding cultural treasures .
berlin might have been basking in its new-found glory as a breeding ground for cutting-edge art and fashion , but its hip reputation did n't translate into profits . amid much discussion about radio quotas to boost home-grown pop , the german music industry pinned its hopes of recovery on popkomm , one of the many international trade fairs to relocate to berlin in 2004 .
in autumn , the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall served as reminder that reunification is still a very touchy subject - while a visit from britain 's queen elisabeth in november unearthed some even older resentments .

the eu 's aid chief has also suggested an urgent conference for international donors to coordinate their funds to the affected nations . immediately after news of the unexpected killer tidal waves in the indian ocean broke on sunday , the european commission was quick to allocate € 3 million -lrb- $ 4.7 million -rrb- to the international red cross to deliver aid for the victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and taiwanese rescue team members load provisions and rescue supplies in phuket , thailand now , the eu has signaled it is ready to top that amount with the release up to € 30 million to the affected countries .
eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said the eu would be " right at the top of the table of donors . " of the extra funds , € 10 million was available now for india , sri lanka and the maldives , and a further € 10 million for indonesia once the government had come forward to define its needs .
the remainder would be allocated to other countries .
michel has urged that the money should be used wisely .
" we have to move very quickly with rehabilitation efforts .
we must n't let a vacuum develop , " he said .
questions over fund distribution but , despite the swift announcement of funds to the affected regions , problems still plague their distribution and coordination .
the crisis task force created by echo , the european commission humanitarian aid organization , still has to work out answers to questions facing all aid donors : who is the best contact group for us in the region ? and what projects does it make sense to fund at the present moment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel the eu 's aid chief has underlined that that the full extent of the damage is n't yet known , and that aid groups do n't yet have the complete picture of where aid is needed most .
a spokeswoman for echo said the task force would be able to name 10 concrete aid projects by friday , that would use up the first € 10 million of the eu 's € 30 million aid budget .
more projects are expected to take shape in the coming year once the exact needs of the people in the crisis areas are assessed .
focus on medium-term bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a destroyed market building in banda aceh .
at the same time , michel warned that given the enormous scale of the disaster , there is a risk of failing to prepare for the massive task of reconstruction that will come afterwards .
efforts must focus as much on the medium-term rehabilitation phase as immediate emergency efforts , michel said , noting that it would be a huge mistake to leave a gap between the two stages .
" i am very anxious about the linkage between the emergency phase and the second phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.if there is a gap between the two phases , i think it will have catastrophic consequences , " he said .
echo a heavyweight in international aid financially speaking , echo is a heavyweight in the world of international emergency aid .
it had budgeted some € 500 million on humanitarian aid projects in 2004 , with a reserve of some € 220 million , which will be tapped to finance the current emergency measures in south asia .
it has already sent experts to the affected countries to gather its own impression of what needs to be done .
projects that are financed by echo funding will be realized by aid groups and non-governmental organizations , or ngos , including the red cross and german agro action , among others .
their funding applications will be processed and checked by brussels , which will either approve or deny the request .
as far as government agencies go , echo is considered in ngo circles to be fairly efficient .
conference call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tidal waves wash through houses at maddampegama , about 60 kilometers south of colombo , sri lanka michel has also said that international donors should consider holding an urgent conference to coordinate their aid to countries hit by the tsunami that has killed more than 60,000 people .
the conference , michel said , could be organized with the united nations and partners such as the united states and japan .
but he stopped short of making a formal call for such a meeting .
" it would be at least useful for the eu and its member states to meet , and discuss this problem quite quickly , and this conference could be expanded or done in collaboration with other donors , " he said .
" the conference would be an attempt to be prepared at the right moment . "
such a conference should take place within weeks , not months , he said .
he said a part of the reconstruction effort could be setting up an early warning system , built with european assistance . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 30.12.2004 germany 2004 : the road to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the path to reform has been an unpopular one the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .
the reforms , meant to boost economic growth and ensure survival of the welfare system , have been controversial . many people consider it a four-letter word , even though it actually has five of them , plus a roman numeral - hartz iv , the name of the latest package of welfare and labor market reforms that have been at the center of sharp-edged political debates and noisy street demonstrations during the past year .
hartz iv has even entered the national lexicon , having been designated the " word of the year " by the gfds , the german language society .
the reforms , part of the german government 's overall " agenda 2010 " package and to go into effect on jan .
1 , are aimed at loosening labor market regulations and trimming welfare benefits , two developments that many analysts say are necessary if germany wants to emerge from its economic stagnation , compete in an increasingly globalized world and maintain the sustainability of its welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new reforms involve a lot of paperwork .
the core of the reform includes substantial cuts to benefits provided to the long-term unemployed .
in theory , lower payouts from the government will encourage the jobless to accept work that is offered to them , even if it is low paid .
the government wants to put a dent in germany 's stubborn - and growing - unemployment rate , which is now at nearly 4.5 million .
more than 10 percent of the population are registered as out of work .
in some areas in eastern germany , that number is almost double .
angry populace but the reform plans have triggered anger among many germans , particularly those in the former east germany , who complain that jobs are simply not available in a region which is structurally weak and has yet to catch up with the more affluent west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an angry populace already incensed by cuts in health benefits that took effect at the beginning of 2004 and freezes in pension levels , tens of thousands of bitter germans took to the streets during august and september in so-called " monday demonstrations . "
they were modeled on similar protests in the east in 1989 that led to the collapse of the east german government .
they complained that the government was dismantling the cherished german welfare state and would end up driving many into poverty .
the social democratic-green government coalition watched as its approval ratings fell to all-time lows during the protests .
despite the anger , however , the protests petered out at the end of september when the demonstrations failed to ignite similar passion in western germany .
health cuts while the preparations and finishing touches on the hartz iv reforms got the lion 's share of public attention in germany , another reform program had already gone into effect in january .
in the summer of 2003 , the government had decided on a revamp of the nation 's expensive health care system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms , aimed at reducing the costs of a system heading toward insolvency , cut back on some services , such as those for dentures and health spa visits , and required patients to pay for medicines that were previously covered by public health plans .
patients were suddenly required to reach into their wallets when visiting the doctor 's office , since a € 10 -lrb- $ 13.60 -rrb- fee per quarter was imposed .
in the beginning , the german media was full of reports of elderly , disabled or chronically ill people who could no longer afford the medical care they needed , or of the difficulties in administering the fee payment system at doctors ' offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt but , the furor soon died down .
this week , health minister ulla schmidt , who was once among germany 's least-liked politicians because of the reforms , said she was satisfied with their effects over the past year , since required payroll contributions were kept under the 15 percent mark and the new office fee reduced the number of unnecessary visits to the doctor .
" no one can say anymore that the system has broken down , " she said , although analysts argue that its long-term survival will likely involve more cuts .
pulling up the rear although german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he is committed to his slew of reforms , germany is trailing among european welfare states which have changed their system in response to the changing times .
sweden , for years held up as the model of a state providing its citizens cradle-to-grave benefits , embarked on a far-reaching deregulation program in the 1990s .
it reduced the number of state-owned companies , increased the amount of privately managed social services and deregulated the telecommunications , postal and railway networks .
its unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's main square denmark also went through a radical liberalization of its labor market , making it much easier to hire and fire employees .
" danish companies are more willing to hire new employees in times of economic revival than their european competitors , who have trouble letting off workers when the economy goes downhill again , " the danish confederation of trade unions has said in an official statement , words which one will certainly not hear from a german union .
the result has been an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent , well below the 8.9 percent average in the european union , not to mention germany 's rate of over 10 percent .
change or die ?
a report by the european economic advisory group -lrb- eeag -rrb- on the european economy in 2004 said the overall picture of reform efforts in europe suggests that those countries which have been slow to liberalize , such as france , germany and italy , have not managed to reduce unemployment rates .
the report also said smaller countries have an easier time liberalizing policies than larger ones .
despite the protests from german citizens that berlin 's reforms are hammering the final nail in the welfare state 's coffin , chancellor schröder has insisted that the system 's preservation is one of the most urgent issues facing europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a speech he gave this summer , he said the challenges of globalization and an aging society left germany no choice but to reform the system .
he rejected accusations that the reforms were unfair to the poor and vulnerable in society .
" fairness is what will benefit our children and children 's children and help preserve the welfare state , " he said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .
workshops of diverse area artists and craftsmen can be visited as well . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harz mountains : historic , romantic , athletic forest-covered mountains , moors , cliffs , rolling hills , deep gorges - the landscape of the harz is nothing if not varied .

the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down . it 's like an illustrated storybook : half-timbered houses with decorated facades line narrow alleyways , topped with a tangle of church spires and peaked roofs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stained-glass window in quedlinburg the entire town of quedlinburg - located near the harz mountains in the state of saxony-anhalt - is a showplace .
there are 1,300 half-timbered houses from eight centuries competing for just 80 hectares -lrb- 200 acres -rrb- of space .
the historic town was named a unesco world heritage site , to be preserved as a national treasure , in 1994 .
cathedral and a king 's grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in quedlinburg " quedlinburg 's old town is an unusual example of a medieval european city , " was unesco 's justification for its decision to put quedlinburg on its list of national treasures .
the collegiate church of saint servatius , with the graves of the first german king heinrich i and his wife mathilde , as well as the cathedral 's treasury , are roman architectonic masterpieces .
with 24,000 inhabitants , quedlinburg has one of the largest surfaces for a landmark in germany .
in the historic center , a full 800 buildings are individually designated as landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quedlinburg sculpture detail when it was part of east germany , the deocrative facades of quedlinburg 's buildings began to fall apart .
at that time , the old buildings fell into disrepair , and there were even plans to level buildings .
tricky restoration but starting in 1990 , after reunification , the city underwent a restoration , to the tune of around € 640 million -lrb- $ 870 million -rrb- according to unesco figures .
the castle hill created the most problems .
the steep sandstone cliffs , which supported the renaissance era collegiate church and its 1000-year-old treasury , were on the brink of collapse due to underground waterways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poet klopstock the town 's current status tends to make it a haven for tourists , and there is no lack of attractions .
the " klopstockhaus " at the foot of the castle hill is the birthplace of the german poet friedrich gottlieb klopstock -lrb- 1724-1803 -rrb- , and now houses a museum in his honor .
art lovers can visit the feininger gallery , which shows works by expressionist painter lyonel feininger -lrb- 1871-1956 -rrb- .
the timbered-house museum and the glass painting museum also attract visitors .

derrick bensted , 78 , was ordered in july to move out of half of stag cottage in whitstable , kent , because of a dispute over a lease .
he inherited the home unaware previous owners had rented half of it from the whitstable oyster and fishery company but a court upheld the lease 's terms .

facing the prospect of spending 2005 in half of his former home , he said : " if it had been that upsetting i 'd have given in a long time ago .
" i 'm determined to just stick where i am , you should n't give in to these people . "
the house was built in 1860 and was extended onto land owned by the oyster company .
successive owners paid rent to the firm for the section they owned , but when mr bensted inherited the house in the 1990s he said he was unaware of the arrangement and did not pay .
the oyster company offered him £ 80,000 for his part of the house , which he turned down , and the firm said it had tried to negotiate with him , but he had not wanted to talk .
