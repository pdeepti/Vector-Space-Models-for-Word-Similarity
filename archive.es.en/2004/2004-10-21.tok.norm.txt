" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 germans enhance champions league chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franca was on target as leverkusen regained their european poise victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages . the topsy-turvy form of bayer leverkusen flip-flopped the right way on tuesday night in their crucial champions league group b match against serie a outfit as roma .
klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .

it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

the consortium includes hotel group lopesan and construction firm satocan , both active in the canary islands , a popular destination for german holidaymakers .
the two companies will be backed in the consortium by spanish banks , banco santander , banco bilbao , banco espanol de credito and barcelona-based caja de ahorros y pensiones , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to the matter .
based on the closing price of tui shares on wednesday of € 16.09 , westlb 's stake in the travel giant is currently worth around € 900 million -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
handelsblatt said the spanish consortium could buy a stake of just 29 percent in tui , so as not to be compelled under german law to make a public takeover offer for the remaining shares .
westlb declined to comment on the report , saying simply that it was in talks with a number of different interested parties .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de speculation over travel giant tui 's future rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned .

the consortium includes hotel group lopesan and construction firm satocan , both active in the canary islands , a popular destination for german holidaymakers .
the two companies will be backed in the consortium by spanish banks , banco santander , banco bilbao , banco espanol de credito and barcelona-based caja de ahorros y pensiones , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to the matter .
based on the closing price of tui shares on wednesday of € 16.09 , westlb 's stake in the travel giant is currently worth around € 900 million -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
handelsblatt said the spanish consortium could buy a stake of just 29 percent in tui , so as not to be compelled under german law to make a public takeover offer for the remaining shares .
westlb declined to comment on the report , saying simply that it was in talks with a number of different interested parties .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de speculation over travel giant tui 's future rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc barroso faces crucial political test jose barroso , the former portuguese prime minister , will have to engineer a deal with the european parliament that will diffuse the current crisis over his team of commissioners .
the deal , while pandering to the wishes of meps - several of whom are gunning for italian commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione following his conservative comments on gays and women - can not afford to be seen as giving in too much to the parliament .
some have suggested that a solution be found by taking away some responsibility in buttiglione 's justice and home affairs portfolio to give to other commissioners .
the socialists , the second biggest group in the brussels assembly , flatly rejected this on wednesday .
however , the center-right epp group , with 268 meps of the 732-member parliament , remains supportive of buttiglione .
aside from having to find a solution that fits with the conflicting wishes of the parliamentary groups , barroso will also have to deal with the other commissioners who have come in for some strong criticism - including the danish -lrb- mariann fischer boel -rrb- , the latvian -lrb- ingrida udre -rrb- and the hungarian -lrb- laszlo kovacs -rrb- candidates .
if buttiglione 's portfolio is changed , a door will have been opened to parliament 's wish to have more say on the approval of individual commissioners as it would be the direct result of one committee 's vote to reject the italian .
at the moment , under eu law , meps can only vote to reject the commission as a whole and not single members of the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc barroso faces crucial political test jose barroso , the former portuguese prime minister , will have to engineer a deal with the european parliament that will diffuse the current crisis over his team of commissioners .
the deal , while pandering to the wishes of meps - several of whom are gunning for italian commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione following his conservative comments on gays and women - can not afford to be seen as giving in too much to the parliament .
some have suggested that a solution be found by taking away some responsibility in buttiglione 's justice and home affairs portfolio to give to other commissioners .
the socialists , the second biggest group in the brussels assembly , flatly rejected this on wednesday .
however , the center-right epp group , with 268 meps of the 732-member parliament , remains supportive of buttiglione .
aside from having to find a solution that fits with the conflicting wishes of the parliamentary groups , barroso will also have to deal with the other commissioners who have come in for some strong criticism - including the danish -lrb- mariann fischer boel -rrb- , the latvian -lrb- ingrida udre -rrb- and the hungarian -lrb- laszlo kovacs -rrb- candidates .
if buttiglione 's portfolio is changed , a door will have been opened to parliament 's wish to have more say on the approval of individual commissioners as it would be the direct result of one committee 's vote to reject the italian .
at the moment , under eu law , meps can only vote to reject the commission as a whole and not single members of the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu proposes crisis center for terrorist attacks this center would " bring together representatives of all relevant commission services during an emergency , " says the proposal - one of a series of anti-terrorism measures published by the commission on wednesday .
it is also proposed that a general rapid alert system , to be named after the multi-eyed greek god argus , be set up to link all of the specialized emergencies systems that can be found in the various member states .
the brussels executive also recommends that at least € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- a year is spent on research on security in the eu .
energy , communications , health , food and transport are among those " critical infrastructures " that are at increased risk of " catastrophic terrorist attacks . "
referring specifically to the biggest terrorist attack on european soil , the madrid attack in march , the paper says that support to the victims and families of terrorist attacks must be " an integral part of the response . "
on the financing of terrorism , the brussels executive suggests stepping up its scrutiny of charities - an area where it is thought a substantial chunk of the money that eventually ends up in terrorists hands is channelled .
the proposals - four separate communications by the european commission - will be presented on monday to eu justice ministers .
however , the council and the eu 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator gijs de vries also have to propose measures - which will eventually go to eu leaders for approval .
if and when such proposals see the light of day is up to member states .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .

schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .

now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .

eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .

schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .

schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .

after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german autoworkers are worried about job security crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures . after nearly a week of strikes at opel plants , workers agreed to return to the assembly line on thursday , while negotiations carried on behind close doors between union representatives and the management of the german branch of us auto giant general motors .
at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .
looking for a way out of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of a late shift gather in bochum for a spontaneous work stoppage after general motors announced it would have to cut up to 10,000 jobs in germany at opel , general motors management and employee representatives met in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , to discuss ways out of the carmaker 's current crisis , following the decision by opel workers to return to work after several days of walkouts .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .

ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .

possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .
25 whether iran is cooperating or not . iran refused wednesday to give up on producing enriched uranium , which is the process used to make fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on , during more cordial times last year .
" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .
the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .

" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .

sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .

it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .

the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .
25 whether iran is cooperating or not . iran refused wednesday to give up on producing enriched uranium , which is the process used to make fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on , during more cordial times last year .
" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .

vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .
hanover have put in solid performances of late to build a safe eighth place for themselves and will not be a pushover come 3.30 p.m. nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .

it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .

" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .

" a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.

the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said . " a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .

the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .

if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute . " german researchers have concluded that people caught in traffic jams are three times more likely to suffer a heart attack an hour later than those who are n't tied up on the road .

after examining 690 cases of heart attack victims , who survived at least 24 hours after the onset of the attack and were able to provide data about the activities leading up to the first signs of heart failure , the team of medical researchers were able to draw a connection between the exposure to traffic and the start of a myocardial infarction within one hour afterward .
they concluded that the time an individual spends in cars , on public transportation , on motorcycles or bicycles was consistently linked with an increase in the risk of heart attack .
" transient exposure to traffic may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in susceptible persons , " the researchers reported . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .
looking for a way out of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of a late shift gather in bochum for a spontaneous work stoppage after general motors announced it would have to cut up to 10,000 jobs in germany at opel , general motors management and employee representatives met in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , to discuss ways out of the carmaker 's current crisis , following the decision by opel workers to return to work after several days of walkouts .
top of the agenda were gm 's plans to axe thousands of jobs in europe and in germany in particular .
the negotiations were expected to last weeks as management and unions hammered out ways of keeping redundancies to a minimum and sought solutions to maintain opel 's german manufacturing base in the long term .
workers at the car maker 's bochum factory , seen as one of the main targets of gm 's draconian cost-cutting plans , voted wednesday to return to work following nearly a week of unofficial strikes .
the workers had been out since last thursday after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10,000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .
25 whether iran is cooperating or not . iran refused wednesday to give up on producing enriched uranium , which is the process used to make fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on , during more cordial times last year .
" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .
the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said . " a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .
bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 germans enhance champions league chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franca was on target as leverkusen regained their european poise victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages . the topsy-turvy form of bayer leverkusen flip-flopped the right way on tuesday night in their crucial champions league group b match against serie a outfit as roma .
klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .

if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute . " german researchers have concluded that people caught in traffic jams are three times more likely to suffer a heart attack an hour later than those who are n't tied up on the road .
a study of hundreds of heart attacks in the southern german town of augsburg published in the new england journal of medicine found nearly one in 12 myocardial infarctions were linked to traffic .
rough ride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rush hour traffic - a health risk ?
after examining 690 cases of heart attack victims , who survived at least 24 hours after the onset of the attack and were able to provide data about the activities leading up to the first signs of heart failure , the team of medical researchers were able to draw a connection between the exposure to traffic and the start of a myocardial infarction within one hour afterward .
they concluded that the time an individual spends in cars , on public transportation , on motorcycles or bicycles was consistently linked with an increase in the risk of heart attack .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .
the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .
25 whether iran is cooperating or not . iran refused wednesday to give up on producing enriched uranium , which is the process used to make fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on , during more cordial times last year .
" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .
the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said . " a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding .

" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions .

" a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .

werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .
while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .

wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .

schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .

after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .

ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .

possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .
looking for a way out of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of a late shift gather in bochum for a spontaneous work stoppage after general motors announced it would have to cut up to 10,000 jobs in germany at opel , general motors management and employee representatives met in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , to discuss ways out of the carmaker 's current crisis , following the decision by opel workers to return to work after several days of walkouts .
top of the agenda were gm 's plans to axe thousands of jobs in europe and in germany in particular .
the negotiations were expected to last weeks as management and unions hammered out ways of keeping redundancies to a minimum and sought solutions to maintain opel 's german manufacturing base in the long term .
workers at the car maker 's bochum factory , seen as one of the main targets of gm 's draconian cost-cutting plans , voted wednesday to return to work following nearly a week of unofficial strikes .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .

" we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .

" if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .
looking for a way out of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of a late shift gather in bochum for a spontaneous work stoppage after general motors announced it would have to cut up to 10,000 jobs in germany at opel , general motors management and employee representatives met in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , to discuss ways out of the carmaker 's current crisis , following the decision by opel workers to return to work after several days of walkouts .
top of the agenda were gm 's plans to axe thousands of jobs in europe and in germany in particular .
the negotiations were expected to last weeks as management and unions hammered out ways of keeping redundancies to a minimum and sought solutions to maintain opel 's german manufacturing base in the long term .
workers at the car maker 's bochum factory , seen as one of the main targets of gm 's draconian cost-cutting plans , voted wednesday to return to work following nearly a week of unofficial strikes .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .

the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said . " a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .
-lrb- october 20 , 2004 -rrb- iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .
we have made our own proposals and await their response , " aghazadeh said . missile test increases concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an another front which has raised concern abroad , iran carried out a new test on wednesday of its upgraded shahab-3 ballistic missile , which it says has a range of at least 2,000 kilometers -lrb- about 1,200 miles -rrb- , defense minister ali shamkhani said . " a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .

the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .

fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 germans enhance champions league chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franca was on target as leverkusen regained their european poise victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages . the topsy-turvy form of bayer leverkusen flip-flopped the right way on tuesday night in their crucial champions league group b match against serie a outfit as roma .
klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .

wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .

schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .

now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .

sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .

at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .
however , there were chances in the first 45 minutes with midfield maestro alexander hleb , silvio meissner and cacau all going close with efforts in the first half . weak bvb failed to ignite dortmund was only dangerous at set pieces with balls lofted into giant czech striker jan koller who manage to escape the constant attentions of his minder for the afternoon , markus babbel , to threaten only sporadically and to little effect .
the brazilian ewerthon and sunday oliseh will also be ruing the chances they squandered before half-time . after the break , vfb weathered an early gust rather than a storm , as bvb blew hot for a few minutes before being overwhelmed again by the surging runs of hleb and phillipp lahm .
a defensive slip in the 52nd minute allowed hinkel to stride forward into the gap in front of the bvb area and unleash a wicked shot to claim his first ever bundesliga goal . kuranyi 's return heralds killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's cacau from brazil rises above dortmund 's guy demel .
sixteen minutes later , after the return of kevin kuranyi from injury , stuttgart were two up .
kuranyi showed no signs of the knee injury which had ruled him out for four weeks when he skinned the bvb defense to slide a pass to cacau in the area .
it took two touches , one to turn the defenders on each shoulder and the other to lift the bullet shot high into the net past warmuz , to put the game beyond dortmund . with werder bremen and bayern munich both losing and league leaders wolfsburg playing on sunday , stuttgart went top - at least until sunday night .
on the strength of this performance , which also saw timo hildebrand extend his clean sheet to 502 minutes without a goal against him , stuttgart look good value for money at the top of the league . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a story of keeping pace and hopes alive the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .

compared to last year , the country has moved up a slot on the organization 's anti-corruption index to position 15 .
" in an international comparison , germany is seen as being a little less corrupt than in the previous year , " said hansjörg elshorst , head of the german branch of transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- .
this is good news for the economy , because corruption scares off foreign investors , he said .
nonetheless , the statistical director of the study estimated the economic losses through corruption to be about € 50 billion -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- .
germany 's improved standing in the past few years is largely attributed to the absence of any major political and economic scandal .
leading the list of least corrupt countries this year were again the scandinavian countries , with finland topping the list .
in europe , poland ranked the lowest at position 67 , while the would-be eu candidate turkey came in at number 77 . dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?
germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 teams champing at the bit to right wrongs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will want to dig themselves out of the hole of schalke 's making the seven days between bundesliga matches just ca n't pass quick enough for some teams wanting to make up points and places lost in week eight . they say a week is a long time in politics and the old adage works just as well in the world of soccer .
bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .
hanover have put in solid performances of late to build a safe eighth place for themselves and will not be a pushover come 3.30 p.m. nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use and that no-one tries to deprive us of this , " he said after a cabinet meeting .
" we are ready to cooperate and believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach an understanding . " the iranian atomic energy organization chief was more blunt , warning that tehran would reject a european proposal aimed at defusing the standoff if it did not respect its rights to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" civil nuclear technology ... is one of the legitimate rights of any country .
we do not accept any proposition which does not respect our rights , " gholamreza aghazadeh said . iran is under international pressure over its nuclear activities amid us allegations it could be secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , charges tehran vehemently denies . diplomatic and trade incentives on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and jack straw .
iranian officials are to attend a meeting in vienna on thursday with british , french and german officials to hear their new proposals on a halt to its nuclear enrichment activities .
the three european union states are proposing that tehran halt its controversial work on the nuclear fuel cycle in exchange for possible diplomatic and trade incentives . but hossein mussavian , a senior official in charge of the nuclear file , said tehran refused to give up on producing its own enriched uranium for civilian use despite the international pressure .
" we must be able to produce some of our fuel in iran itself but that does not mean we are turning down fuel offered by the european countries or even the united states , " he said . " the european and g8 countries are saying that the production of nuclear fuel in iran itself is not economical for us .
we reject that argument , " said the official .
" we will be obliged to buy some of our fuel from abroad but the production in iran of fuel is much more economical , " he added . earlier warning unheeded the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address concerns raised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- about its nuclear program .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . in september the iaea called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all related activities , which it has so far refused to do . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we are in favor of having discussions with the europeans .

" a few minutes ago we carried out a new test of the shahab-3 missile in the presence of observers , " he said around 3 p.m.
" we tested the range , the destructive capacity , the guidance system and its capacity to hit a defined target , " he told the isna news agency . " we invited all those who had doubts -lrb- over the missile -rrb- but there were no foreign observers , " he said .
" some people had expressed doubts over the success of our -lrb- last -rrb- test -lrb- on aug .
11 -rrb- ... so we carried out a new test . "
he refused to specify the missile 's range .
" we do not reveal the range of our missiles , " shamkhani said . long range puts rivals in sights steady progress made by iran on its ballistic missile program is a major cause for concern for the international community , already alarmed over the country 's nuclear activities .
the new test will add to the mounting fears , especially as the upgraded shahab-3 , which is supposedly based on a north korean design , has an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers .
previous figures had put the missile 's range at between 1,300 and 1,700 kilometers , already bringing arch-enemy israel and us bases in the region well within range . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .

werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 stuttgart claim top spot with win over bvb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alex hleb dominated the midfield and was a constant threat to bvb matthias sammer 's stuttgart went top of the bundesliga on saturday after a 2-0 win over the coach 's former team .
at times efficient , at others exciting , vfb looked the complete package and deserving league leaders . matthias sammer 's first duel against his ex-club borussia dortmund ended in victory in the gottlieb daimler stadium as stuttgart beat bvb 2-0 to go top of the bundesliga and stretch their unbeaten run . goals from andreas hinkel and cacau heaped more misery on dortmund who had been under a cloud for most of the week after financial reports gave them the dubious honor of being the most in-debt club ever in the history of the bundesliga .
while the club slipped further in the red , it was all white as far as this game went with dortmund chasing stuttgart ghosts for much of the 90 minutes . in front of 48,000 spectators in the sold out stadium , the hosts battled hard to break down what was an extremely defensive bvb team .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.10.2004 germans enhance champions league chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franca was on target as leverkusen regained their european poise victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages . the topsy-turvy form of bayer leverkusen flip-flopped the right way on tuesday night in their crucial champions league group b match against serie a outfit as roma .
klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .
bayer leverkusen 's slump continued with defeat in kiev .

bayern munich will be champing at the bit to put the 1-0 home reverse against schalke in week eight right by beating hansa rostock away this weekend . this game can not come quick enough for felix magath 's side who will dearly love to regain ground on the top teams with a comprehensive victory on their travels .
add an unlucky champions league defeat to the mixture of emotions and rostock may have to brace themselves for a match against a wounded beast . however , rostock will be feeling equipped to deal with the threat and may add more misery on a team who looked to have sorted out its problems only to have slipped into self-destruction once again .
rostock 's win against bochum last week moved them further away from the drop-zone and will have instilled an air of confidence ahead of one of the most potentially difficult matches the bundesliga can offer . bochum are looking into the abyss after their home defeat to rostock and facing championship contenders wolfsburg may not be the best remedy for their relegation zone woes . lingering over the bottom three , bochum have seen a competent if not spectacular early season campaign disintegrate over the period of the last month and have dropped out of contention for the european places into the danger area .
a loss on saturday will bring the elevators crashing down into the basement . wolves looking to reclaim top spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's goalkeeper claus reitmaier .
wolfsburg will be eager to leap-frog stuttgart at the top of the league and reclaim the summit by beating bochum at home .
the comprehensive defeat by hanover last sunday squandered a great chance to reassert the wolves ' position as alpha males and , with other usurpers on their tails , anything but a win will see them become just one of the pack . stuttgart showed championship potential against borussia dortmund in week eight and have the chance to either extend their lead or reclaim it with a victory over sc freiburg on sunday .
fluid attacking and solid defending undid the woeful bvb on saturday and any repeat of the offensive prowess shown by the likes of alex hleb and cacau against freiburg will result in another win for unbeaten vfb . freiburg have been in freefall for a number of weeks now and are currently inhabiting the last of the relegation spots .
fellow strugglers nuremburg put a 1-0 win over the southerners last week and consigned them to the latest defeat in a growing list of reverses that have seen freiburg sink from sixth to 16th in the space of two months . nuremburg lifted themselves up to 11th win the win over freiburg but their surge away from the drop zone may be checked this weekend when they visit the champions at the weser stadium .
bremen will be seething after letting mainz beat them 2-1 last week and will take heart from a spirited comeback in the champions league against anderlecht on wednesday . champions eager to close widening gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will not want to be in fifth for long and a win could bring them back into serious contention .
eight points off the top is far enough for a team wanting to retain the championship , eleven would be a disaster . mainz will have to wait until sunday to see where their amazing adventure goes next when they travel up the autobahn to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 .
third on merit , mainz have the chance to go second if results go their way on saturday and to send the newly promoted bundesliga virgins into raptures .
beating the champions last week will have them believing that anything is possible . schalke 04 , however , will be returning to bundesliga action after their first uefa cup group a clash on thursday in switzerland against basle a week after beating bayern munich on their own turf .
an indifferent start to the season now sees the royal blues up in sixth with a run of more competent results in their favor . bvb eye drop-zone with concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toothless dortmund lacked any bite against stuttgart .
schalke 's bitter rivals borussia dortmund will look at sixth place as heaven on earth after being consigned to 13th with the 2-0 loss in the gottlieb daimler stadium on saturday .
more worrying will be the nature of their defeat to stuttgart .
dortmund showed little desire to get back into the match at 1-0 and were overwhelmed at 2-0 . the visit of hamburg may prove to be a nadir in their campaign .
a defeat against an hsv team in turmoil could mean bvb head further down the league , adding performance worries to the club 's financial woes . hamburg , who parted company with klaus toppmöller after losing 2-0 to arminia bielefeld and sinking to the bottom of the league , are seemingly doomed to the overpowering force of relegation .
after a few brave attempts to drag themselves away from the drop zone , hamburg , now under the control of former germany international thomas doll , have been dragged back into the dogfight at the base of the league .
although it is only week nine , time is running out for hsv to get themselves together enough to avoid spending the whole campaign fighting the vacuum at the bottom . leverkusen aim to keep momentum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arminia bielefeld take the confidence gained from their victory against hamburg and the relative safety of 10th place to the capital to visit a resurgent hertha berlin .
berlin overpowered leverkusen in a 3-1 victory which wiped out a campaign start full of low scoring draws and dour performances in one swipe .
now up to seventh after flirting with the basement , berlin seem to be back to the mid-table form of old . leverkusen , fresh from overturning as roma in the champions league , will be an awesome challenge for kaiserslautern if they continue this latest surge of confidence . after slipping up in recent weeks , bayer will hope that their devastating form of the early exchanges has returned for good .
brazilian flair , east european unpredictability and german solidity should combine to great effect once more to see off kaiserslautern , who lost 2-0 to borussia mönchengladbach last week . mönchengladbach must build on win gladbach , possibly minus oliver neuville after his ' hand of god ' goal earned him a ban , continue their uneven campaign at hanover on saturday .
after impressive early form , the promise of a decent season has turned into the ignominy of 12th place . however , a win last week will help to restore the confidence of the first few weeks and may lead to a resurgent push towards the winter break .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .

" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2004 german publishers ' eastern expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waz also publishes in bulgaria since the fall of the berlin wall , german publishers looking for lucrative new markets have headed to eastern europe .
today , their growing dominance in the region is raising some eyebrows . last week , the berlin-based german publisher axel springer verlag launched a new newspaper in hungary entitled reggel , or “ morning . ”
it joined more than twenty other springer-owned titles already on the market there and hit the newsstands just one year after fakt , another springer newspaper , was first published in poland .
the latter has since gone on to become that country ’ s largest circulation daily . springer ’ s slew of new titles are part of its ongoing effort to expand into eastern europe , and they have helped to gain the publisher a position of considerable prominence in the post-communist media world .
however , springer ’ s situation is not unique . starting in the early 1990 ’ s , many powerhouse german publishers , including the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- and the passauer neue presse -lrb- pnp -rrb- , led the charge east , seeking lucrative alternatives to the saturated market at home .
and they were soon joined by others around europe . but more than a decade later - at a time when the growth of media monopolies is a cause of concern around the world - some are starting to wonder if the concentration of eastern european media outlets in just a few , particularly german , hands poses a serious threat to editorial independence and media pluralism in the region . warm welcome gives way to suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt .
at first , german publishers were welcomed with open arms .
the struggling post-socialist economies and fledgling press desperately needed an influx of cash , and it was widely hoped that foreign media giants would - along with their money - bring a western-style tradition of journalistic excellence . “ journalists were initially delighted , ” oliver money kyrle , a division director at the international federation for journalists , told dw-world .
“ they assumed journalistic standards would be imported from the west and that they would be granted more freedom because the publications they worked for would no longer be owned by people with a particular political interest . ” but as time passed , eastern europe ’ s media became concentrated in foreign hands - a situation that eventually awakened concern among industry insiders and watchdog groups alike .
with foreign , mostly german , owners taking over up to 83 percent of daily newspapers in some eastern european countries -lrb- not to mention significant gains in the television and magazine sector -rrb- , concerns increased . romanian ’ s experience causes alarm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waz hq in essen .
the recent experience of journalists at a waz newspaper in romania only confirmed some critic ’ s worst fears .
last month , journalists from the romania libera newspaper turned up at their parent company ’ s headquarters in essen to protest what they claimed was editorial interference .
they accused waz management of giving direct orders to cut political coverage and passing out a daily list of what not to criticize . gossip hounds suggested that the close ties between bodo hombach , the head of waz , and the leaders of romania ’ s current social democratic government , of which the paper is very critical , were to blame .
bodo zapp , a waz spokesman , however , said the changes were simply the result of an effort to “ modernize the paper ” and reverse falling circulation figures by moving towards more lifestyle and tabloid-style coverage . a threat to media pluralism and quality journalism ? in two separate reports , the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- and the south eastern european network for the professionalization of the media -lrb- seenpm -rrb- - in partnership with the peace institute for contemporary social and political studies - have documented the size of the monopolies and to what extent , if any , they pose a threat . in the end , the experts came out divided .
the media landscapes in various countries are very different , they said , adding that it 's therefore hard to generalize and assume that what has happened in one country could necessarily happen in another . experts : romanian situation not the norm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a local resident woman picks up a magazine in a newspaper shop in budapest .
mihaly galik , the author of the hungarian portion of the seenpm report told dw-world that he doesn ’ t believe that the type of editorial interference the romanian journalists claimed they experienced would likely happen in hungary .
likewise , beata klimkiewicz , author of the polish chapter of the report , said such a situation was unlikely in poland . jozsef bayer , the managing director of the hungarian springer group concurred , and told dw-world that , in fact , the new reggel newspaper represented a significant contribution to independent media in hungary , pointing to a situation unique to hungary : the fact that many of the large daily papers are owned and operated by major political parties . “ we are independent economically , and we can give our journalists and editors the chance to provide fair and balanced reports , ” he said . meanwhile , money kyrle , who oversaw the compilation of the ifj report , thinks the fact that many publishers - foreign or not - have a monopoly should be cause for worry , even if there ’ s not yet considerable evidence that they have abused that dominant position . “ the point is , if they ever decided to interfere with editorial independence , there is very , very little anyone could do to stop them , ” money kyrle said .
“ let ’ s be honest , if waz wanted to , they could decide the next government of bulgaria or macedonia . ” foreigners accused of “ dumbing down ” media nonetheless , all agreed that the growing media monopolies did pose some problems , if not because owners with overt political objectives would try to interfere with editorial independence , then because the monopolies could reduce the variety of publications available and - possibly - the quality of journalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media critics around the world cite the growing trend towards so-called “ infotainment ” as a problem , and eastern europe is no exception .
fakt , the new springer-backed polish newspaper , is modeled on the tabloid-style german newspaper bild . but that ’ s not to say that foreign owners are to blame for importing a style of journalism otherwise completely foreign to the region , as many homegrown publishers also fund similar publications .
the question is , are foreign owners motivated to invest in “ quality ” journalism for the public good , or do they see their publications in eastern europe as purely commercial , moneymaking ventures ? money kyrle thinks it might be more a case of the latter . “ our impression is that serious journalism is not a priority for foreign owners , ” he said .
“ there is a question of publishers wanting to tone down professional standards due to commercial concerns .
so maybe they don ’ t have an outright political objective and it ’ s more a question of the bottom line . ” mihaly galik , in hungary , partly agrees , but does not necessarily lay the blame with foreign owners .
“ regardless of whether an owner is foreign or not , you have to wonder if publishers think it is worth it to invest in labor intensive , costly quality journalism these days , ” he said .
“ some make the argument that non-hungarians are less motivated to make an effort , but that is very hard to prove - i haven ’ t seen any evidence that in hungary , at least , domestic publishers are doing a better job . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's special dossier on germany 's media landscape .

at the same time , talks between the management of vw , europe 's biggest carmaker , and the powerful ig metall labor union entered their fourth round in hanover , northern germany , after a week-long break .
vw is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff at its german production sites and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
for their part , unions are demanding job guarantees for 10 years plus a four percent increase in wages .
the clock is ticking time is running out for both sides - vw 's current wage agreement expires on oct .
28 , as does the so-called " friedenspflicht " deadline banning industrial action during wage negotiations .
ig metall has said it would call for warning strikes if no progress were made by next week .
" if no outcome is reached by oct .
28 , vw will face warning strikes in early november , " said the union 's chief negotiator harmut meine .
possibilities for compromise the union was prepared to explore possibilities for compromise in management 's cost-cutting plans .
but that was not a blank check for management to make demands that were unacceptable , meine said .
some progress appeared to have been made at the end of a third round of negotiations last week .
management indicated it was ready to provide job guarantees - the main demand of the ig metall labor union - in return for concessions on the part of workforce .
ig metall described the development as a " small step in the right direction " but key issues still needed to be resolved .
and vw 's chief negotiator , josef-fidelis senn , also said that the two sides were still " a long way apart " on many details .
looking for a way out of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of a late shift gather in bochum for a spontaneous work stoppage after general motors announced it would have to cut up to 10,000 jobs in germany at opel , general motors management and employee representatives met in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , to discuss ways out of the carmaker 's current crisis , following the decision by opel workers to return to work after several days of walkouts .
top of the agenda were gm 's plans to axe thousands of jobs in europe and in germany in particular .
the negotiations were expected to last weeks as management and unions hammered out ways of keeping redundancies to a minimum and sought solutions to maintain opel 's german manufacturing base in the long term .
workers at the car maker 's bochum factory , seen as one of the main targets of gm 's draconian cost-cutting plans , voted wednesday to return to work following nearly a week of unofficial strikes .
the workers had been out since last thursday after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10,000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .

" we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany are offering valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . this carrot-and-stick approach would include a light-water reactor if iran indefinitely suspends all uranium enrichment activities . naseri said iran wanted " to have a clear view about what the end game is . " he said the europeans were reacting to a proposal iran had made in september for a global solution to tehran 's problems with western nations , including security agreements for the middle east .
" both sides have been talking about trying to come to a negotiated agreement which will be on the basis of a win-win situation for both sides and be acceptable to both sides , " naseri said . however , he refused to say whether iran would honor an iaea deadline for tehran to immediately halt all uranium enrichment activities . " there is no time line , no deadline whatsoever in any form or matter as far as iran is concerned , " naseri said .
pirooz hosseini , iran 's ambassador to the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told afp earlier that iran expected to hear a proposal from the european trio but that no decision would be reached thursday .
" we have to receive the text and then take it back to our capital and see if it is approved , and if it is not approved , then that is another story , " he said . a chance to come clean the meeting was designed to give iran a last chance to come clean before the iaea decides on nov .
25 whether iran is cooperating or not . iran refused wednesday to give up on producing enriched uranium , which is the process used to make fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on , during more cordial times last year .
" we demand respect for our rights to have nuclear technology for civilian use , " president mohammad khatami said , while adding that tehran was open to " dialogue and negotiation . " the united states wants the iaea to send iran to the un security council , which could impose punitive sanctions .
the iaea has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program . europeans favor " constructive engagement " but the european trio have so far opposed this strategy , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . they reached an agreement with iran in october 2003 to suspend uranium enrichment .
but this did not include support activities such as building centrifuges and making the feed gas for the enrichment process . bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in tehran in 2001 .
the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the europeans also promised help on a range of " political and security issues , " saying they would continue to regard the main iranian resistance group the people 's mojehidin -lrb- mek -rrb- " as a terrorist organization . " if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
" it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . dw staff -lrb- afp / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of eu talks as a delegation from germany , france and britain meets iranian officials to discuss the nuclear stand-off on thursday , iran has reiterated its negative stance and upped the pressure by testing a long-range missile .

klaus augenthaler 's boys took a giant stride towards the knockout phase with a 3-1 win over the hot-headed italian side . after an exhilarating start to both bundesliga and european campaigns , which saw leverkusen comprehensively beat the likes of bayern munich and real madrid , bayer came apart when it appeared they would sweep all before them . league and cup defeats followed in consecutive weeks but in front of a passionate bayarena crowd , leverkusen showed great resolve to come back from a damaging francesco totti free-kick in the 26th minute to eclipse the romans who lost the plot and then , consequently , the game . international talent fires germans leverkusen 's win had an international flavor to it with the victory assured by goals from brazilians robson ponte and franca , and polish international jacek krzynowek .
leverkusen 's composed fight back was in stark contrast to the combustion within the highly-strung roma side , which finished the game with nine men . coming from a goal behind against explosive opponents in a cauldron atmosphere could mean that leverkusen have reached the light at the end of this particular early season tunnel .
" the team now realizes what is at stake and i just hope that another setback does not come along , " explained coach augenthaler . leverkusen now have six points and are in with a good shout of qualifying for the next stage while roma look to be out of the competition after failing to register a point from their three european matches so far . bayern undone by pavel the magician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved sealed bayern 's fate in turin .
bayern munich may be passing the leverkuseners on the autobahn heading in the opposite direction into a tunnel with the back-to-back defeats in the bundesliga and champions league .
after weakly surrendering to schalke 04 on saturday , bayern fell victim to european footballer of year pavel nedved and his juventus side in a hard fought group c match which the bavarians lost 1-0 . meeting for the very first time in european competition , the teams conjured up few clear-cut chances and appeared to be heading for a point apiece until czech midfielder nedved latched onto zlatan ibrahimovic 's flicked header and fired past oliver kahn from close range . european champions on four occasions , bayern were forced to deploy dutch international roy makaay as a lone striker with fellow forwards claudio pizarro , vahid hashemian and roque santa cruz all nursing injuries . midfielder sebastian deisler , who has been suffering from depression , came to italy with the bayern squad , but returned home to germany on monday afternoon following discussions with coach felix magath . a cagey contest dominated by solid defenses was eventually unlocked by nedved who pounced on the hour .
french defender lillian thuram 's long ball up field was met by swedish striker ibrahimovic , whose deft header set up nedved and the industrious , floppy-haired midfielder shot left-footed beyond kahn . bayern were denied an equalizer moments later when gianluigi buffon tipped bastian schweinsteiger 's fierce drive over the bar .
bayern , with two wins from their first two group c matches , now face two home games as they look to secure qualification while unbeaten leaders juve look assured of a knock-out phase spot with nine points . werder on course for next phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two goals from bremen 's croat international klasnic brought werder closer to the next phase .
werder bremen have a fantastic chance of making the knockout phase following a 2-1 group g win over anderlecht in belgium on wednesday night .
it was the same score line by which werder triumphed the last time the two clubs met here in europe 's premier competition back in the 1993/94 campaign . a brace from croatian international ivan klasnic cancelled out christian wilhelmsson 's 26th minute opener and moved the german champions onto six points from their three matches . " we had a lot of chances for an away match in the champions league , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were put under pressure but won and that is all that counts . " his comments were echoed by striker mirolsav klose who could have had a hat-trick but for some hurried finishing .
" we played well and collected the three points so we have to be happy , " explained klose .
" we should have wrapped up the match earlier on but wasted a lot of chances . " wilhelmsson 's goal for the home side in the 26th minute spurred bremen into action and ten minutes later the visitors equalized thanks to a calamitous error from anderlecht goalkeeper daniel zitka which left klasnic with an open goal .
the croat 's second , and the match winner , came in the 59th minute after good work by under-fire frenchman johan micoud and klose . a late flurry from the belgian champions put werder under pressure but bremen held their nerve and built on their 2-1 win over valencia to give themselves a good chance of progressing from the group stage .
bremen sit in second place behind inter milan who thrashed spanish champions valencia 5-1 to tighten their grip on the top spot . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern , bremen lift euro hopes ahead of clash bayern munich and werder bremen both recorded european champions league wins in mid-week to add spice to an already mouthwatering bundesliga match this saturday .

he was in ramsgate on wednesday to launch an urban bus scheme in thanet .

the controversial film , about a female abortionist working in the 1950s , had picked up the prestigious golden lion award at the venice film festival .
british actress imelda staunton also received plaudits for her performance as the illegal abortionist .
the london festival will showcase more than 180 films during its two-week run .
there was no script , no character , you had to create and invent it actress imelda staunton at wednesday night 's premiere , leigh said he hoped the low-budget film , which he quipped was made for " about five shillings " would ignite a debate on the issue of abortion .
" i 'm pro-choice but i hope this is a film that does not bludgeon the audience in black and white .
it 's a moral dilemma , " he said .
staunton said making the film had been an extraordinary experience .
" we were taking huge risks but we were in safe hands .
there was no script , no character , you had to create and invent it . "
controversy phil davis , who plays vera 's husband , played down the possibility of the film receiving a heated reception from british audiences .
" although it 's a controversial subject i do n't think it will cause too much controversy here . "
director anthony minghella was also at the festival 's opening .
he said : " i like the way there are no gongs and no trophy at the film festival .
it 's very unadulterated . "
vera drake won the golden lion and best actress in venice among the other films scheduled to show at the festival are the latest pixar animation the incredibles , woody allen 's melinda and melinda and danny boyle 's movie millions .
stars expected to be in london during the festival include kevin bacon and reese witherspoon , who will be promoting her bollywood version of vanity fair .
the festival will close on 4 november with a gala screening of i heart huckabees , an existential comedy starring jude law , jason schwartzman and naomi watts .
as well as predicted blockbusters , the festival will also screen many art house movies from around the world including china , angola and uruguay .

the west midlands regional assembly will consider the plan for the 50-mile " m6 expressway " from north of birmingham to just south of manchester .
the department for transport 's plan is fiercely opposed by the campaign to protect rural england and other environmental groups .
ministers favour the toll motorway plan over widening the existing m6 .
the regional assembly , a lobbying and planning group , will decide on thursday whether or not to support the plan , which is said to be a threat to wildlife in the area .
the meeting is taking place on the last day of a public consultation process which began in july .
environmental pressure group transport 2000 said it had been told that for every submission sent in favour of the scheme , there had been 18 opposed to it .
traffic fears the tollway would stretch from junction 11a on the m6 to junction 19 , at knutsford , or possibly junction 20 .
it would run through rolling countryside in cheshire and staffordshire .
a government commissioned study recommended widening the road from four to six lanes in each direction , but ministers believed a new tollway would be less disruptive to motorists .
transport 2000 said the tollway would encourage people to use their cars and do nothing to ease traffic on the road .
the cpre said options that would have improved public transport choices were not fully explored .
it said the tollway plan contradicted a government decision in 2002 to widen the m6 .
it said it feared this could represent a move toward a major tollway building programme .

the west midlands regional assembly will consider the plan for the 50-mile " m6 expressway " from north of birmingham to just south of manchester .
the department for transport 's plan is fiercely opposed by the campaign to protect rural england and other environmental groups .
ministers favour the toll motorway plan over widening the existing m6 .
the regional assembly , a lobbying and planning group , will decide on thursday whether or not to support the plan , which is said to be a threat to wildlife in the area .
the meeting is taking place on the last day of a public consultation process which began in july .
environmental pressure group transport 2000 said it had been told that for every submission sent in favour of the scheme , there had been 18 opposed to it .
traffic fears the tollway would stretch from junction 11a on the m6 to junction 19 , at knutsford , or possibly junction 20 .
it would run through rolling countryside in cheshire and staffordshire .
a government commissioned study recommended widening the road from four to six lanes in each direction , but ministers believed a new tollway would be less disruptive to motorists .
transport 2000 said the tollway would encourage people to use their cars and do nothing to ease traffic on the road .
the cpre said options that would have improved public transport choices were not fully explored .
it said the tollway plan contradicted a government decision in 2002 to widen the m6 .
it said it feared this could represent a move toward a major tollway building programme .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- academics take on video games bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 21 october , 2004 , 05:50 gmt 06:50 uk academics take on video games by clark boyd technology correspondent in copenhagen the impact of video games on culture and society is a topic of serious study , with a danish research centre leading the way in the normally stodgy world of academia .
the center for computer games research at copenhagen 's information technology university is truly one of a kind .
for starters , it is one of the few places in the world where you can do phd-level work in video game studies .
the centre 's purpose is to study how games are both made and played .
the scholars here would like to use that knowledge to help design better games in the future .
such rigorous study requires the right equipment , of course .
the centre 's game room features a giant , flat panel television , complete with surround sound speakers .
follow the tangled mass of cords and leads , and you can find every available console gaming system .
against the wall sits a set of shelves filled with all the latest titles .
childhood reward for a dozen or so academics , this gaming paradise is home .
they like to try to convince you that they spend the bulk of their days in their offices , researching , thinking , and writing .
but do not be fooled .
the centre 's scholars also spend a lot of time in the game room , playing titles like super monkey ball .
in case you are wondering what there is to say , academically , about super monkey ball , it is an interesting example of how games help players develop hand-eye coordination .
the multi-player mode , i am told , also makes for a good study in human rivalries .
jonas schmidt , a phd candidate at the centre , started gaming when he was a child .
he always hoped there would be a reward .
" it was weird to think that there would be some sort of pay-off for all of the hours spent , " said mr schmidt .
" you know , telling our parents this , but they did n't believe us .
they should see this . "
explosion in interest the center for computer games research got its official start last year .
as part of the it university , it is funded entirely by the danish government . "
it 's the place in the world that seems to take game research most seriously these days , the place that really had a strategy for dealing with games research " espen aarseth , norwegian scholar the idea grew out of an academic conference on games back in 2001 .
the conference was organised by two scholars now at the centre .
lisbeth klastrup , one of the organisers , says that to her surprise , the conference drew 140 scholars from around the world .
" it demonstrated to this university that here was an area that had a lot of potential , " said dr klastrup .
" and it was a very conscious choice on behalf of the university to support the game theme .
i think it was a convergence of political and also academic interest happening at the same time . "
academic interest in games has , like the industry itself , exploded in recent years .
universities across the globe have been adding computer game design and theory courses to their curricula .
norwegian scholar espen aarseth was looking for ways to bring his expertise in literature and linguistics to the field of game studies .
he says that the centre in copenhagen was a natural choice .
" it 's the place in the world that seems to take game research most seriously these days , the place that really had a strategy for dealing with games research , " said professor aarseth .
that strategy is fairly straightforward .
the centre tries to keep an open mind when it comes to game studies .
theory and practice economists , sociologists , political scientists and philosophers are all welcome to focus a critical eye on games .
" i 've tried to figure out what kind of academic discipline could not be used to study games , and the only thing i could come up with is dentistry , " joked prof aarseth .
" but of course , when i suggested this at a games conference in finland a few years ago , there was a dentist who objected in the audience .
so , any discipline you can imagine can be used to study games . "
the research projects at the centre do run a wide gamut .
one spanish academic is looking at the ethics of games .
another scholar wants to explore educational uses for commercial computer games .
still another focuses on women and women 's issues in gaming .
there are also people here like jesper juul , who is focusing on the practice of designing games .
" i think it 's very easy to fall into this divide where you either do theory , or practice , " said dr juul .
" i think it 's very important that we keep both things in play at the same time , and have them talk to each other .
" and we are finding out that the theory that we are doing does actually influence and inform design , and vice versa . "
the very nature of computer games is changing thanks to the interplay between theory and design .
virtual life titles like doom 3 , with its battles against aliens and monsters , are still popular . "
we 're still not sure what games are .
that will hopefully be a question that takes us a long time to answer . "
lisbeth klastrup , center for computer games research but not as popular as the sims , a human simulator that lets you create a person , and follow along as that person lives out a virtual life , from birth to death , on-screen .
instead of slaying aliens , you send your character on mundane missions , like getting the paper , taking out the trash , or dancing and flirting with a potential mate .
the centre 's gonzalo frasca says that popularity of the sims is proof that the world of computer gaming is becoming not only broader , but deeper .
" aliens and monsters and trolls and every possible nasty creature have their place on the computer , " said mr frasca .
" but i also think humans have a place , and humans carry their issues , their politics and their problems , and that 's why we 're going to see more and more of those on the computer screen . "
and that ultimately means more work for academics interested in computer games .
" we 're still not sure what games are , " says the centre 's dr klastrup with a laugh .
" that will hopefully be a question that takes us a long time to answer . "

norwegian scholar espen aarseth was looking for ways to bring his expertise in literature and linguistics to the field of game studies .
he says that the centre in copenhagen was a natural choice .
" it 's the place in the world that seems to take game research most seriously these days , the place that really had a strategy for dealing with games research , " said professor aarseth .
that strategy is fairly straightforward .
the centre tries to keep an open mind when it comes to game studies .
theory and practice economists , sociologists , political scientists and philosophers are all welcome to focus a critical eye on games .
a hard day at the office then ?
" i 've tried to figure out what kind of academic discipline could not be used to study games , and the only thing i could come up with is dentistry , " joked prof aarseth .
" but of course , when i suggested this at a games conference in finland a few years ago , there was a dentist who objected in the audience .
so , any discipline you can imagine can be used to study games . "
the research projects at the centre do run a wide gamut .
one spanish academic is looking at the ethics of games .
another scholar wants to explore educational uses for commercial computer games .
still another focuses on women and women 's issues in gaming .
there are also people here like jesper juul , who is focusing on the practice of designing games .
" i think it 's very easy to fall into this divide where you either do theory , or practice , " said dr juul .
" i think it 's very important that we keep both things in play at the same time , and have them talk to each other .
" and we are finding out that the theory that we are doing does actually influence and inform design , and vice versa . "
the very nature of computer games is changing thanks to the interplay between theory and design .
virtual life titles like doom 3 , with its battles against aliens and monsters , are still popular .
we 're still not sure what games are .
that will hopefully be a question that takes us a long time to answer .
lisbeth klastrup , center for computer games research but not as popular as the sims , a human simulator that lets you create a person , and follow along as that person lives out a virtual life , from birth to death , on-screen .
instead of slaying aliens , you send your character on mundane missions , like getting the paper , taking out the trash , or dancing and flirting with a potential mate .
the centre 's gonzalo frasca says that popularity of the sims is proof that the world of computer gaming is becoming not only broader , but deeper .
" aliens and monsters and trolls and every possible nasty creature have their place on the computer , " said mr frasca .
" but i also think humans have a place , and humans carry their issues , their politics and their problems , and that 's why we 're going to see more and more of those on the computer screen . "

rigorous study requires the right equipment the center for computer games research at copenhagen 's information technology university is truly one of a kind .
for starters , it is one of the few places in the world where you can do phd-level work in video game studies .
the centre 's purpose is to study how games are both made and played .
the scholars here would like to use that knowledge to help design better games in the future .
such rigorous study requires the right equipment , of course .
the centre 's game room features a giant , flat panel television , complete with surround sound speakers .
follow the tangled mass of cords and leads , and you can find every available console gaming system .
against the wall sits a set of shelves filled with all the latest titles .
childhood reward for a dozen or so academics , this gaming paradise is home .
they like to try to convince you that they spend the bulk of their days in their offices , researching , thinking , and writing .
games like super monkey ball are said to improve co-ordination but do not be fooled .
the centre 's scholars also spend a lot of time in the game room , playing titles like super monkey ball .
in case you are wondering what there is to say , academically , about super monkey ball , it is an interesting example of how games help players develop hand-eye coordination .
the multi-player mode , i am told , also makes for a good study in human rivalries .
jonas schmidt , a phd candidate at the centre , started gaming when he was a child .
he always hoped there would be a reward .
" it was weird to think that there would be some sort of pay-off for all of the hours spent , " said mr schmidt .
" you know , telling our parents this , but they did n't believe us .
they should see this . "
explosion in interest the center for computer games research got its official start last year .
as part of the it university , it is funded entirely by the danish government .

the conference was organised by two scholars now at the centre .
lisbeth klastrup , one of the organisers , says that to her surprise , the conference drew 140 scholars from around the world .
" it demonstrated to this university that here was an area that had a lot of potential , " said dr klastrup .

rigorous study requires the right equipment the center for computer games research at copenhagen 's information technology university is truly one of a kind .
for starters , it is one of the few places in the world where you can do phd-level work in video game studies .
the centre 's purpose is to study how games are both made and played .
the scholars here would like to use that knowledge to help design better games in the future .
such rigorous study requires the right equipment , of course .
the centre 's game room features a giant , flat panel television , complete with surround sound speakers .
follow the tangled mass of cords and leads , and you can find every available console gaming system .
against the wall sits a set of shelves filled with all the latest titles .
childhood reward for a dozen or so academics , this gaming paradise is home .
they like to try to convince you that they spend the bulk of their days in their offices , researching , thinking , and writing .
games like super monkey ball are said to improve co-ordination but do not be fooled .
the centre 's scholars also spend a lot of time in the game room , playing titles like super monkey ball .
in case you are wondering what there is to say , academically , about super monkey ball , it is an interesting example of how games help players develop hand-eye coordination .
the multi-player mode , i am told , also makes for a good study in human rivalries .
jonas schmidt , a phd candidate at the centre , started gaming when he was a child .
he always hoped there would be a reward .
" it was weird to think that there would be some sort of pay-off for all of the hours spent , " said mr schmidt .
" you know , telling our parents this , but they did n't believe us .
they should see this . "
explosion in interest the center for computer games research got its official start last year .
as part of the it university , it is funded entirely by the danish government .
it 's the place in the world that seems to take game research most seriously these days , the place that really had a strategy for dealing with games research espen aarseth , norwegian scholar the idea grew out of an academic conference on games back in 2001 .
the conference was organised by two scholars now at the centre .
lisbeth klastrup , one of the organisers , says that to her surprise , the conference drew 140 scholars from around the world .
" it demonstrated to this university that here was an area that had a lot of potential , " said dr klastrup .
" and it was a very conscious choice on behalf of the university to support the game theme .
i think it was a convergence of political and also academic interest happening at the same time . "
academic interest in games has , like the industry itself , exploded in recent years .
universities across the globe have been adding computer game design and theory courses to their curricula .
norwegian scholar espen aarseth was looking for ways to bring his expertise in literature and linguistics to the field of game studies .
he says that the centre in copenhagen was a natural choice .
" it 's the place in the world that seems to take game research most seriously these days , the place that really had a strategy for dealing with games research , " said professor aarseth .
that strategy is fairly straightforward .
the centre tries to keep an open mind when it comes to game studies .
theory and practice economists , sociologists , political scientists and philosophers are all welcome to focus a critical eye on games .
a hard day at the office then ?
" i 've tried to figure out what kind of academic discipline could not be used to study games , and the only thing i could come up with is dentistry , " joked prof aarseth .
" but of course , when i suggested this at a games conference in finland a few years ago , there was a dentist who objected in the audience .
so , any discipline you can imagine can be used to study games . "
the research projects at the centre do run a wide gamut .
one spanish academic is looking at the ethics of games .
another scholar wants to explore educational uses for commercial computer games .
still another focuses on women and women 's issues in gaming .
there are also people here like jesper juul , who is focusing on the practice of designing games .
" i think it 's very easy to fall into this divide where you either do theory , or practice , " said dr juul .
" i think it 's very important that we keep both things in play at the same time , and have them talk to each other .
" and we are finding out that the theory that we are doing does actually influence and inform design , and vice versa . "
the very nature of computer games is changing thanks to the interplay between theory and design .
virtual life titles like doom 3 , with its battles against aliens and monsters , are still popular .
we 're still not sure what games are .

japan 's exports rose 12.5 % on 2003 to 5.46 trillion yen -lrb- $ 50.6bn ; £ 27.9bn -rrb- , a high since records began in 1947 .
but an oil-fuelled rise in imports meant the boost to the trade surplus was smaller than expected .
japan 's economy minister said this week that oil prices were the biggest threat to economic growth .
although the september exports figure showed strong growth over the same month in the previous year , it was down slightly on august when seasonally adjusted .
the same pattern could be found in the trade surplus , the amount by which exports exceed imports .
september produced a surplus of 1.24 trillion yen , up 12.7 % in comparison with 2003 .
but that figure was 21.8 % lower than august 's surplus .
the decline , said shuji shirota at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in tokyo , suggested " signs of peaking out - mostly due to a slowdown in overseas economies and rising crude oil prices " .

japan 's exports rose 12.5 % on 2003 to 5.46 trillion yen -lrb- $ 50.6bn ; £ 27.9bn -rrb- , a high since records began in 1947 .
but an oil-fuelled rise in imports meant the boost to the trade surplus was smaller than expected .
japan 's economy minister said this week that oil prices were the biggest threat to economic growth .
although the september exports figure showed strong growth over the same month in the previous year , it was down slightly on august when seasonally adjusted .
the same pattern could be found in the trade surplus , the amount by which exports exceed imports .
september produced a surplus of 1.24 trillion yen , up 12.7 % in comparison with 2003 .
but that figure was 21.8 % lower than august 's surplus .
the decline , said shuji shirota at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in tokyo , suggested " signs of peaking out - mostly due to a slowdown in overseas economies and rising crude oil prices " .

the us supreme court ruled earlier this year that detainees can challenge their imprisonment in the american courts .
a district judge has now decided that any meetings with legal representatives must not be filmed or recorded .
around 600 suspects are still held at guantanamo bay , although nearly 200 have been released or transferred .
government lawyers failed to convince judge colleen kollar-kotelly that audio and visual recording should be made of suspects ' meetings with their lawyers and that the authorities should be able to review the lawyers ' notes .
the judge dismissed arguments that allowing conversations to proceed unmonitored might pose a risk to national security .
instead she stressed the importance of the confidential relationship between lawyer and client .
the court is acutely aware of the delicate balance that must be struck when weighing the importance of national security against the rights of the individual colleen kollar-kotelly us district judge the judgement came in a 25-page ruling on a case brought by three kuwaiti men held at guantanamo bay since late 2001 .
the men sued the us government in 2002 demanding to be told the nature of charges against them , as well as claiming the right to legal representation and meetings with their families .
" the court is acutely aware of the delicate balance that must be struck when weighing the importance of national security against the rights of the individual , " judge kollar-kotelly wrote .
" however , the government has supplied only the most slender legal support for its argument , which can not withstand the weight of the authority surrounding the importance of the attorney-client privilege . "
also on wednesday , two detainees accused of links to al-qaeda appeared before us military review panels , while four others refused to attend their hearings .
the reviews have been set up to determine whether detainees can be classified as " enemy combatants " and subsequently tried before military tribunals .
around 200 reviews have been held so far , but just one prisoner has been released .

the casting call will be held on 10 november at the cbs television city studio complex in los angeles .
the elvis wannabes should be prepared to sing 10 bars of any of the king 's songs , the network said .
no broadcast date has been set for the four-hour miniseries , which will go into production early next year in cooperation with the singer 's estate .
although the audition call is open to anyone , a cbs spokeswoman said the network had not necessarily settled on casting an unknown for the title role .
poverty " if we get an unknown , that 's great , " she said .
born in east tupelo , mississippi , presley grew up in poverty and his music skills emerged after moving to memphis , tennessee , at the age of 13 .
by 1956 , in his early 20s , he had a recording contract with rca and a movie deal with paramount pictures .
that year he had four number one singles .
he resumed his film career following time in the army but disappeared from the pop charts while bands such as the beatles and the rolling stones enjoyed success .
he made a comeback in 1968 and returned to live performances over the next several years .
but his dependence on stimulants and depressants led to his death in 1977 at the age of 42 .

environment minister elliot morley said some threatened birds are recovering because of conservation measures .
farmers in cumbria have joined others round the country in signing up to the countryside stewardship scheme .
a range of " green farming " projects are helping wild birds ranging from waders and grey partridge to barnacle geese and tree sparrows .
one of those highlighted is keith temple , from raughton head , near carlisle , whose work has resulted in a growing population of tree sparrows .
' no complacency ' this autumn , the birds are back , feeding along a special 300m wildlife strip that has been planted with special crops to provide food .
alongside them are bullfinch and reed buntings .
mr morley said : " these figures show some encouraging signs that our policies for biodiversity are resulting in positive outcomes for birds , but there is no room for complacency and much more remains to be done . "
he said it was encouraging to see numbers of scarce birds , like the woodlark and dartford warbler were increasing , reflecting the amount of work being done , but there were still some worrying declines .
the government allocates £ 145m a year to the countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas scheme , which help maintain and improve habitats for birds .
