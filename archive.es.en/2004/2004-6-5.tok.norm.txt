mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people .

other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .

yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .

these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .
i also know that many of the german soldiers during the war were doing what they felt was their duty .
their blood on the battlefield was just as red as the allies ' .
it is only right to include all victims of d-day during the ceremony . - andrew e. tompkins , usa i would welcome the attendance of germans because i know that it would be in the right spirit .
i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .
if schröder does that , then he will earn the respect of many people , that like me , believe that the official history was written by the allies and it 's not entirely true .
at least , the excuse by kohl was an honest one and not by a populist . - luis iñarra it 's time for reconciliation .
germany should take part in the d-day commemoration . - alexandre vallim , brazil yes , yes , for sure germany has to be there .
germany is part of our european history .
it should be looked upon as a model and a bitter warning of what nations can accomplish .
germany was , as it still is , a model in setting standards in technology and economic development .
germany also administered a very , very bitter lesson in history of what may happen when madness becomes a substitute for reason .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .

schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

" only through joint action will we succeed in fighting this recent war , the war caused by the terror attacks , " berlusconi said . bush called the war on terrorism the " challenge of our time " and compared it to the west 's fight against communism in the post-world war ii era .
" the fundamental question is will we hold the line and uphold our values , " he said . he thanked berlusconi for his help in negotiating with u.n. security council members who had opposed the iraq war , such as russia .
and he said he was confident that the u.n. security council would soon adopt a resolution on iraq endorsing a new interim government for the country and establishing a multinational force to provide security for the country to organize elections in january .
" i sense a spirit of unity in terms of working with the new iraqi government , " bush said . berlusconi is one of bush 's strongest allies in europe .
his country has around 2,700 troops in iraq , the third largest foreign contingent there after those of the united states and britain .
dissent from pope , protesters meeting on friday with the pope , who opposed the iraq war , bush said he shared the pontiff 's feelings about the pictures of u.s. soldiers abusing and humiliating iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib prison . " i , like his holiness , was repulsed by the pictures i saw about the treatment by some of our troops toward iraqi prisoners , " bush said .
" that treatment did not reflect the spirit of america .
those people stained our honor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man holds a u.s. flag with a swastika upside down at a protest against president bush 's visit to rome on friday .
despite tight security measures , bush 's visit was accompanied friday by tens of thousands of anti-war protesters on the streets of rome .
bush said he was happy to be in a country where people are free to voice their opinions .
" democracy is a beautiful thing , " he commented . bush is set to meet with french president jacques chirac saturday for a working dinner in paris .
the u.s. president is likely to have a difficult time presenting such a positive picture after meeting with chirac as he did with berlusconi .
france , one of the countries most vehemently opposed to the iraq war , has demanded changes to the draft security council resolution and called for more input from iraq 's interim leaders and the u.n. envoy , lakhdar brahmini . on sunday , bush will take part in celebrations commemorating the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings of the allies during world war ii in normandy , northern france . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests and pope greet bush in rome president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .

it is only right to include all victims of d-day during the ceremony . - andrew e. tompkins , usa i would welcome the attendance of germans because i know that it would be in the right spirit .
i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .
if schröder does that , then he will earn the respect of many people , that like me , believe that the official history was written by the allies and it 's not entirely true .
at least , the excuse by kohl was an honest one and not by a populist . - luis iñarra it 's time for reconciliation .
germany should take part in the d-day commemoration . - alexandre vallim , brazil yes , yes , for sure germany has to be there .
germany is part of our european history .
it should be looked upon as a model and a bitter warning of what nations can accomplish .
germany was , as it still is , a model in setting standards in technology and economic development .
germany also administered a very , very bitter lesson in history of what may happen when madness becomes a substitute for reason .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

" only through joint action will we succeed in fighting this recent war , the war caused by the terror attacks , " berlusconi said . bush called the war on terrorism the " challenge of our time " and compared it to the west 's fight against communism in the post-world war ii era .
" the fundamental question is will we hold the line and uphold our values , " he said . he thanked berlusconi for his help in negotiating with u.n. security council members who had opposed the iraq war , such as russia .
and he said he was confident that the u.n. security council would soon adopt a resolution on iraq endorsing a new interim government for the country and establishing a multinational force to provide security for the country to organize elections in january .
" i sense a spirit of unity in terms of working with the new iraqi government , " bush said . berlusconi is one of bush 's strongest allies in europe .
his country has around 2,700 troops in iraq , the third largest foreign contingent there after those of the united states and britain .
dissent from pope , protesters meeting on friday with the pope , who opposed the iraq war , bush said he shared the pontiff 's feelings about the pictures of u.s. soldiers abusing and humiliating iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib prison . " i , like his holiness , was repulsed by the pictures i saw about the treatment by some of our troops toward iraqi prisoners , " bush said .
" that treatment did not reflect the spirit of america .
those people stained our honor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man holds a u.s. flag with a swastika upside down at a protest against president bush 's visit to rome on friday .
despite tight security measures , bush 's visit was accompanied friday by tens of thousands of anti-war protesters on the streets of rome .
bush said he was happy to be in a country where people are free to voice their opinions .
" democracy is a beautiful thing , " he commented . bush is set to meet with french president jacques chirac saturday for a working dinner in paris .
the u.s. president is likely to have a difficult time presenting such a positive picture after meeting with chirac as he did with berlusconi .
france , one of the countries most vehemently opposed to the iraq war , has demanded changes to the draft security council resolution and called for more input from iraq 's interim leaders and the u.n. envoy , lakhdar brahmini . on sunday , bush will take part in celebrations commemorating the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings of the allies during world war ii in normandy , northern france . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests and pope greet bush in rome president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .

their blood on the battlefield was just as red as the allies ' .

i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .
i also know that many of the german soldiers during the war were doing what they felt was their duty .
their blood on the battlefield was just as red as the allies ' .
it is only right to include all victims of d-day during the ceremony . - andrew e. tompkins , usa i would welcome the attendance of germans because i know that it would be in the right spirit .
i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .
if schröder does that , then he will earn the respect of many people , that like me , believe that the official history was written by the allies and it 's not entirely true .
at least , the excuse by kohl was an honest one and not by a populist . - luis iñarra it 's time for reconciliation .
germany should take part in the d-day commemoration . - alexandre vallim , brazil yes , yes , for sure germany has to be there .
germany is part of our european history .
it should be looked upon as a model and a bitter warning of what nations can accomplish .
germany was , as it still is , a model in setting standards in technology and economic development .
germany also administered a very , very bitter lesson in history of what may happen when madness becomes a substitute for reason .
germany should be there , germany should participate as a reckoning party of our common past and as a proud member of today 's europe ! - constantinescu nicolaie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder criticized over d-day plans chancellor gerhard schröder has been criticized for his plans to take part in commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the allied d-day landings in normandy , france on sunday .

" only through joint action will we succeed in fighting this recent war , the war caused by the terror attacks , " berlusconi said . bush called the war on terrorism the " challenge of our time " and compared it to the west 's fight against communism in the post-world war ii era .
" the fundamental question is will we hold the line and uphold our values , " he said . he thanked berlusconi for his help in negotiating with u.n. security council members who had opposed the iraq war , such as russia .
and he said he was confident that the u.n. security council would soon adopt a resolution on iraq endorsing a new interim government for the country and establishing a multinational force to provide security for the country to organize elections in january .
" i sense a spirit of unity in terms of working with the new iraqi government , " bush said . berlusconi is one of bush 's strongest allies in europe .
his country has around 2,700 troops in iraq , the third largest foreign contingent there after those of the united states and britain .
dissent from pope , protesters meeting on friday with the pope , who opposed the iraq war , bush said he shared the pontiff 's feelings about the pictures of u.s. soldiers abusing and humiliating iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib prison . " i , like his holiness , was repulsed by the pictures i saw about the treatment by some of our troops toward iraqi prisoners , " bush said .
" that treatment did not reflect the spirit of america .
those people stained our honor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man holds a u.s. flag with a swastika upside down at a protest against president bush 's visit to rome on friday .
despite tight security measures , bush 's visit was accompanied friday by tens of thousands of anti-war protesters on the streets of rome .
bush said he was happy to be in a country where people are free to voice their opinions .
" democracy is a beautiful thing , " he commented . bush is set to meet with french president jacques chirac saturday for a working dinner in paris .
the u.s. president is likely to have a difficult time presenting such a positive picture after meeting with chirac as he did with berlusconi .
france , one of the countries most vehemently opposed to the iraq war , has demanded changes to the draft security council resolution and called for more input from iraq 's interim leaders and the u.n. envoy , lakhdar brahmini . on sunday , bush will take part in celebrations commemorating the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings of the allies during world war ii in normandy , northern france . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests and pope greet bush in rome president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio horeb will soon be spreading god 's word over all of munich the decision to award a catholic radio station one of munich 's coveted fm frequencies has caused outcry among critics who say the programming is too fundamentalist . klaus mucha is a catholic priest who , lately , has been receiving phone calls from angry parishioners cursing him , and telling him to go to hell .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .
the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go .
-lrb- nov.8 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should radio horeb be allowed to broadcast on fm ?

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .
i also know that many of the german soldiers during the war were doing what they felt was their duty .
their blood on the battlefield was just as red as the allies ' .
it is only right to include all victims of d-day during the ceremony . - andrew e. tompkins , usa i would welcome the attendance of germans because i know that it would be in the right spirit .
i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .
if schröder does that , then he will earn the respect of many people , that like me , believe that the official history was written by the allies and it 's not entirely true .
at least , the excuse by kohl was an honest one and not by a populist . - luis iñarra it 's time for reconciliation .
germany should take part in the d-day commemoration . - alexandre vallim , brazil yes , yes , for sure germany has to be there .
germany is part of our european history .
it should be looked upon as a model and a bitter warning of what nations can accomplish .
germany was , as it still is , a model in setting standards in technology and economic development .
germany also administered a very , very bitter lesson in history of what may happen when madness becomes a substitute for reason .
germany should be there , germany should participate as a reckoning party of our common past and as a proud member of today 's europe ! - constantinescu nicolaie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder criticized over d-day plans chancellor gerhard schröder has been criticized for his plans to take part in commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the allied d-day landings in normandy , france on sunday .
-lrb- june 5 , 2004 -rrb- schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

the bild-zeitung tabloid quoted well-known german authors walter kempowski and ralph giordano as saying it was " very sad " that schröder had decided against visiting the main german cemetery in la cambe .
it showed that germany still had not accepted its past , they said .
schröder responded to criticism for avoiding the german graveyard from the conservative christian social party and the liberal free democratic party on friday .
he stressed he would visit a soldiers ' cemetery where allies and germans were buried and commemorate the german dead .
in a guest commentary in the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday , british foreign minister jack straw welcomed schröder 's participation in the celebrations , saying it was " a symbol of the long way europe has come . "
" now we have finally left war behind us on our continent , " straw wrote . dw-world.de remembering d-day read dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the allied d-day landings .

" only through joint action will we succeed in fighting this recent war , the war caused by the terror attacks , " berlusconi said . bush called the war on terrorism the " challenge of our time " and compared it to the west 's fight against communism in the post-world war ii era .
" the fundamental question is will we hold the line and uphold our values , " he said . he thanked berlusconi for his help in negotiating with u.n. security council members who had opposed the iraq war , such as russia .
and he said he was confident that the u.n. security council would soon adopt a resolution on iraq endorsing a new interim government for the country and establishing a multinational force to provide security for the country to organize elections in january .
" i sense a spirit of unity in terms of working with the new iraqi government , " bush said . berlusconi is one of bush 's strongest allies in europe .
his country has around 2,700 troops in iraq , the third largest foreign contingent there after those of the united states and britain .
dissent from pope , protesters meeting on friday with the pope , who opposed the iraq war , bush said he shared the pontiff 's feelings about the pictures of u.s. soldiers abusing and humiliating iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib prison . " i , like his holiness , was repulsed by the pictures i saw about the treatment by some of our troops toward iraqi prisoners , " bush said .
" that treatment did not reflect the spirit of america .
those people stained our honor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man holds a u.s. flag with a swastika upside down at a protest against president bush 's visit to rome on friday .
despite tight security measures , bush 's visit was accompanied friday by tens of thousands of anti-war protesters on the streets of rome .
bush said he was happy to be in a country where people are free to voice their opinions .
" democracy is a beautiful thing , " he commented . bush is set to meet with french president jacques chirac saturday for a working dinner in paris .
the u.s. president is likely to have a difficult time presenting such a positive picture after meeting with chirac as he did with berlusconi .
france , one of the countries most vehemently opposed to the iraq war , has demanded changes to the draft security council resolution and called for more input from iraq 's interim leaders and the u.n. envoy , lakhdar brahmini . on sunday , bush will take part in celebrations commemorating the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings of the allies during world war ii in normandy , northern france . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests and pope greet bush in rome president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .

dw-world readers commented . i absolutely believe germany should take part in the d-day ceremony .
germany has come so far over the past 60 years .
their opposition to the war in iraq is just one more example of germany 's non-aggressive posture in today 's world .
i also know that many of the german soldiers during the war were doing what they felt was their duty .
their blood on the battlefield was just as red as the allies ' .
it is only right to include all victims of d-day during the ceremony . - andrew e. tompkins , usa i would welcome the attendance of germans because i know that it would be in the right spirit .
i feel that germany is a very good friend of america now and always will be . - paul babcock , usa i believe that deutschland must participate in the " d-day " ceremony , as long as schröder pays the same respect to the fallen german soldiers buried in la cambe as he plans to do with the english ones .
if schröder does that , then he will earn the respect of many people , that like me , believe that the official history was written by the allies and it 's not entirely true .
at least , the excuse by kohl was an honest one and not by a populist . - luis iñarra it 's time for reconciliation .
germany should take part in the d-day commemoration . - alexandre vallim , brazil yes , yes , for sure germany has to be there .
germany is part of our european history .
it should be looked upon as a model and a bitter warning of what nations can accomplish .
germany was , as it still is , a model in setting standards in technology and economic development .
germany also administered a very , very bitter lesson in history of what may happen when madness becomes a substitute for reason .
germany should be there , germany should participate as a reckoning party of our common past and as a proud member of today 's europe ! - constantinescu nicolaie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder criticized over d-day plans chancellor gerhard schröder has been criticized for his plans to take part in commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the allied d-day landings in normandy , france on sunday .

mucha is one of several people who have dared to criticize a decision by bavaria 's media council -lrb- blm -rrb- to award a popular munich fm frequency to the catholic broadcaster radio horeb .
previously , radio horeb - which gets its name from the old testament word for mount sinai - could only be heard via satellite and regional cable networks .
but starting soon , the station will be preaching its message to munich on 92.4 fm . according to the station 's website , " radio horeb brings the word of god where it belongs : in the houses , on the streets , to the people . " several times each day , listeners will be able to say the rosary along with radio horeb .
other prayers - some lasting as long as 45 minutes - are broadcast at different times during the day . then there are the listener participation programs , where different topics are discussed , and listeners are invited to phone in with their comments .
these are the programs that have given rise to the most controversy . " what radio horeb broadcasts is theology from the 19th century , " said mucha , who is no stranger to religious radio .
for decades , he has produced radio reports for bavaria 's public broadcaster .
but for him , radio horeb goes too far , and represents fundamentalist views . " last week , there was a program about abortion and one about euthanasia .
both topics were linked as a matter of fact to the third reich , " he said . political influence mucha also criticized the blm , accusing them of being swayed by political pressure .
according to reports in munich newspapers , members of the media council received phone calls from state government offices asking them to vote in favor of the station 's application . it 's no secret that bavaria 's state minister in charge of media and cultural affairs , erwin huber , is a devout catholic and major supporter of radio horeb 's bid to claim the fm frequency .
" why should a religiously oriented , catholic broadcaster be denied a place in christian bavaria ? "
huber asked before the decision was announced . anke geiger , who heads the radio committee at the blm , is n't commenting on the decision .
but she did let it be known that she voted against radio horeb 's application because she disagrees with the way the station represents women .
she also said there were indications of racial discrimination . platform for racism ? the blm listened in to radio horeb over a two-day period to get an impression of its content .
in the resulting report , listeners are said to have made racist comments without being interrupted or reprimanded by the show 's host .
one listener called up asking for god 's help " before we , the white race have to abdicate and the colored people take over . "
another caller berated " gypsies , for whom theft is a sport . "
yet another caller complained on air about homosexuals , and said children are wrongly taught at school that homosexuality is normal . radio horeb 's manager , father richard kocher , rejects the criticism of the station .
he said it is unfair to accuse the station of having fundamentalist , misogynist or racist tendencies , and that it ca n't be blamed because a few listeners call in and talk " nonsense . " as for the catholic church , it 's staying out of the controversy , as it has no formal affiliation with radio horeb . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .

a consumer association investigation also found safety checks are not being carried out - increasing the risk of users damaging their skin .
the report 's authors say their findings underline the need for tighter regulation of the industry .
sunbed use has been linked by various studies over the years to an increased risk of skin cancer .
researchers from the watchdog 's consumer magazine health which ? went to 42 tanning outlets across the uk in february this year . "
the industry has clearly shown that it is incapable of regulating itself " kaye mcintosh staff were told a friend wanted to use the sunbed who had red hair and very fair , freckly skin that always burned in the sun .
people with this type one skin are among those at highest risk of developing malignant melanoma due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and sunbeds .
nevertheless , 40 out of the 42 outlets visited said they would allow a person with type 1 skin on their sunbeds .
just under half the 40 were members of the sunbed association whose code of practice states members should turn away people with type 1 skin .
the outlets which gave bad advice were six run by local authorities , 20 tanning shops , 13 health and fitness clubs and one beauty salon .
just two outlets - one local authority operated and a beauty salon - were deemed to offer an " adequate " service .
however , neither of these correctly advised customers not to have more than 60 sessions on a sunbed in a year .
little change kaye mcintosh , from health which ? , said little had changed since a similar investigation uncovered the same problem five years ago .
she said : " as the industry has clearly shown that it is incapable of regulating itself , the government must act immediately on the overwhelming advice from national and international medical experts and honour its duty to protect the public from serious health risks associated with the use of sunbeds in the uk . "
sara hiom , science information manager at cancer research uk , said : " laboratory research has proved that the type of ultraviolet radiation used in sunbeds can cause all types of skin cancer .
" and studies are starting to show that sunbed use is a definite risk factor for malignant melanoma . "
the sunbed association argued the investigation was " flawed " .
in a statement it said : " the style of the mystery shopper research , and the criteria for evaluating and grading the service provided , meant that all of the facilities visited - whether in tsa membership or not - were highly likely if not definite to be given an ' inadequate ' grading .
" an automatic ' inadequate ' grading was awarded to any facility that did not screen out a skin type 1 via a questionnaire . "
ban call cancer research uk and the sunbed association recently called for a ban on sunbed use by children under 16 due to the high risk of cancer in later years .
cases of malignant melanoma - the potentially fatal form of skin cancer - increased by 24 % between 1995 and 2000 .
about 7,000 cases of melanoma are diagnosed annually with about 1,700 deaths resulting from the disease .
it is the third most common cancer among people aged 15-39 .

people with this type one skin are among those at highest risk of developing malignant melanoma due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and sunbeds .

crystal palace park is stepping back in time to host a victorian weekend in honour of the period when the main building was constructed .
joseph paxton 's famous crystal palace opened on the site 's top terrace in 1854 but burnt down in 1936 .
the weekend will feature victorian and edwardian entertainment such as a fun fair , archery and a variety of stalls .
melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation which has organised the event at the park , told bbc news online : " as far as south london is concerned it 's a very important park , for many south-east londoners , it is their back garden .
the fair is on the top terrace where the palace once stood " people feel very passionately about the park and they care about its future .
" we ca n't bring the crystal palace back but we can do a lot of work on the park to bring it back up to standard .
" i hope the celebration will be a fitting tribute to a remarkable building . "

crystal palace park is stepping back in time to host a victorian weekend in honour of the period when the main building was constructed .
joseph paxton 's famous crystal palace opened on the site 's top terrace in 1854 but burnt down in 1936 .
the weekend will feature victorian and edwardian entertainment such as a fun fair , archery and a variety of stalls .
melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation which has organised the event at the park , told bbc news online : " as far as south london is concerned it 's a very important park , for many south-east londoners , it is their back garden .
the fair is on the top terrace where the palace once stood " people feel very passionately about the park and they care about its future .
" we ca n't bring the crystal palace back but we can do a lot of work on the park to bring it back up to standard .
" i hope the celebration will be a fitting tribute to a remarkable building . "
the london development agency is currently consulting with the local community on plans for the future of the park .
the local bromley council handed control of it over to the greater london authority amid fears for the future of the sports centre , which the council said it could not afford to run .

jeremiah horrocks ' first prediction and charting of the transit of venus across the sun revolutionised astronomy .
but it all hinged on his being able to observe the phenomenon from his telescope in the village of much hoole .
the 20-year-old genius had to wait through a day of indifferent weather for his first glimpse of the sun .
important warning never look directly at sun with naked eye or though a camera , binoculars or similar device how to view the transit safely scientists hope that unlike horrocks they will have six hours of summer sun on tuesday 8 june to view the transit of venus .
the celestial rarity takes place twice in eight years every 122 years .
in 2012 , it will not be visible from the uk so much hoole becomes the centre of international scientific attention next week as more than 100 astronomers from around the globe descend on the village .
to put it in current terms , it was as if one of my students had written to stephen hawking proving him wrong dr robert walsh staff at the university of central lancashire -lrb- uclan -rrb- are delighted they have been chosen to coordinate the uk 's observations of the phenomenon - especially because of their proximity to much hoole .
carr house , where horrocks observed the event from his bedroom , will be the centre of uclan 's operations with the scientists getting a chance to view the passage from that very same room .
" this is very , very special to be able to see it as he would have seen it , " said dr robert walsh , senior lecturer from uclan 's centre for astrophysics .
horrocks saw the sun breakthrough around 3.15pm , just half an hour before it was due to set on 24 november -lrb- the modern date would be 6 december -rrb- .
' divine interposition ' during that period he made three accurate observations as the black dot of venus moved across the face of the sun - calculating its size with the path and speed of its orbit .
as the devout christian recalled : " the clouds , as if by divine interposition , were entirely dispersed , and i was once more invited to the grateful task of repeating my observations .
" i then beheld a most agreeable spectacle , the object of my sanguine wishes ...
i could scarcely have wished for a more extended period . "
the cambridge educated farmer 's son from toxteth , liverpool , had made a major leap in astronomy , as dr walsh explained .
" in a simple backwater , using home made equipment , he increased our knowledge of the solar system by a factor of 15 , " he said .
the great astronomer johannes kepler had been the first to predict a venus transit , in 1631 -lrb- which was not visible from europe -rrb- , but he did not predict the one that came in 1639 .
dr walsh said : " to put it in current terms , it was as if one of my students had written to stephen hawking proving him wrong . "
village celebrations along with scientists , students and school children , much hoole villagers are also celebrating with a whole series of events including viewing the transit in a marquee with strawberries and cream .
st michael 's parish church which is the hub of the village 's celebrations has even unveiled a stained glass window commemorating horrocks .
" he is not a household name as newton and halley are , but only because he died so young , aged 22 , " said the village celebrations patron sir patrick moore .
and jeremiah horrocks ' great co-worker william crabtree is also being honoured in his native salford .
a sketch showing the transit of venus from 1769 a nameplate is to be unveiled in broughton on wednesday at the junction of lower broughton road and priory grove , thought to be the site of crabtree 's home at the time he worked with horrocks .
horrocks wrote of crabtree that he " was gratified by beholding the pleasing spectacle of venus upon the sun 's disc .
rapt in contemplation , he stood for some time motionless , scarcely trusting his own senses , through an excess of joy . "
those who want to view the " pleasing spectacle " need to read guidelines issued by the university for safe viewing .
the safest way to be " rapt in contemplation " is to watch it via a webcast or on bbc one .
whatever way you choose to view , however , tuesday may be just a once in a lifetime opportunity .
although there is another transit in 2012 , the next one to be visible from the uk will be in 2117 .
method 1 : cut two holes in card for binocular eye-pieces .
push card onto binoculars and fix with tape .
block one lens -lrb- with lens cap , for example -rrb- .
holding binoculars at waist height , angle towards sun - do not look through them .
move binoculars around until card shadow minimised on viewing surface -lrb- piece of white card best -rrb- .
during six-hour transit , move set-up to follow path of sun across sky , for example by mounting it on tripod or chair .
method 2 : take piece of stiff card and pierce with pin .
hold it up and , looking away from the sun , adjust angle of card until shadow minimised .
pinhole will project image of sun into middle of shadowed area .
place another piece of card under shadow and adjust distance to get best picture - more distance gives larger but fainter image .
hole must be clean and as small as possible .
warning : never observe the sun with the naked eye or telescope , camera or other optical device .
doing so will seriously damage eyesight and may lead to permanent blindness .

" in a simple backwater , using home made equipment , he increased our knowledge of the solar system by a factor of 15 , " he said .
the great astronomer johannes kepler had been the first to predict a venus transit , in 1631 -lrb- which was not visible from europe -rrb- , but he did not predict the one that came in 1639 .
dr walsh said : " to put it in current terms , it was as if one of my students had written to stephen hawking proving him wrong . "
village celebrations along with scientists , students and school children , much hoole villagers are also celebrating with a whole series of events including viewing the transit in a marquee with strawberries and cream .
st michael 's parish church which is the hub of the village 's celebrations has even unveiled a stained glass window commemorating horrocks .
" he is not a household name as newton and halley are , but only because he died so young , aged 22 , " said the village celebrations patron sir patrick moore .
and jeremiah horrocks ' great co-worker william crabtree is also being honoured in his native salford .
a sketch showing the transit of venus from 1769 a nameplate is to be unveiled in broughton on wednesday at the junction of lower broughton road and priory grove , thought to be the site of crabtree 's home at the time he worked with horrocks .
horrocks wrote of crabtree that he " was gratified by beholding the pleasing spectacle of venus upon the sun 's disc .
rapt in contemplation , he stood for some time motionless , scarcely trusting his own senses , through an excess of joy . "
those who want to view the " pleasing spectacle " need to read guidelines issued by the university for safe viewing .
the safest way to be " rapt in contemplation " is to watch it via a webcast or on bbc one .
whatever way you choose to view , however , tuesday may be just a once in a lifetime opportunity .
although there is another transit in 2012 , the next one to be visible from the uk will be in 2117 .
method 1 : cut two holes in card for binocular eye-pieces .
push card onto binoculars and fix with tape .
block one lens -lrb- with lens cap , for example -rrb- .
holding binoculars at waist height , angle towards sun - do not look through them .
move binoculars around until card shadow minimised on viewing surface -lrb- piece of white card best -rrb- .
during six-hour transit , move set-up to follow path of sun across sky , for example by mounting it on tripod or chair .
method 2 : take piece of stiff card and pierce with pin .
hold it up and , looking away from the sun , adjust angle of card until shadow minimised .
pinhole will project image of sun into middle of shadowed area .
place another piece of card under shadow and adjust distance to get best picture - more distance gives larger but fainter image .
hole must be clean and as small as possible .
warning : never observe the sun with the naked eye or telescope , camera or other optical device .
doing so will seriously damage eyesight and may lead to permanent blindness .

new york city may be a bastion of democratic party politics and support , but that did n't stop the republican grassroots ' campaigner-in-chief , ralph reed , from attending a downtown seminar in late may on politics and the internet .
the legendary right-wing organiser - who is leading the president 's re-election team in the south-east - told his mainly left-leaning audience that local democracy was being regenerated through the internet .
that was plain to see a few nights ago , when hundreds of john kerry supporters gathered in venues around the world , via the meetup.com site .
the presumptive presidential nominee for the democratic party is not the first contender to harness the communication potential of meetup .
failed candidate howard dean mobilised thousands of supporters in every state and led the way in internet fundraising .
the organisation which he bequeathed after leaving the democratic race , democracy for america , has the largest membership of any political group on the meetup site - 165,200 people .
mr kerry now comes in second , with 113,600 , and the monthly meetings which anyone can organise and attend are being viewed by the campaign as crucial to its long-term success .
on a thursday night at the end of may , loose groups of kerry supporters gathered in london , paris , toronto , and across the whole united states .
grassroots power in downtown manhattan alone , five different meetups were convened , mostly led by activists affiliated to the national kerry organisation .
there was one notable exception .
i joined up with an earnest group of about 15 young new yorkers at the fashionable 88 orchard street cafe .
most lived locally , and had already attended at least one previous meeting .
" i found out about it from a friend who was doing a meetup for owners of pug dogs , " liz merker said .
" i looked at the site and offered to volunteer to do something for the campaign straight away . "
" being in the meetup is better than sitting around in some stiff meeting with campaign staffers " matt townsend leading the meeting was kerry campaign volunteer pagan harleman , who had met other team officials last week to set out an agenda in order to give focus and direction to the evening .
after 20 minutes of chatting in the dimly-lit moroccan-style basement festooned with cushions , a guest joined us with a puzzled look on his face .
it turned out that our new arrival , dominic pisciotta , who works for the city council , had organised another kerry meetup in the trendy bar next door : " so there 's another meetup going on , on the other side of this wall , " ms harleman said .
" are you running an ad-hoc group that has no idea what 's really happening ? "
mr pisciotta was contrite : " yeah , basically that 's it .
we ordered drinks and stuff , so we ca n't really join you here . "
anarchic element an experienced kerry-supporter was despatched to the bar next door to take control .
when i wandered through shortly afterwards , a group of 20 people were gathered around a large table , sipping mexican beers and margaritas , talking through the myriad ways that activists have devised to raise funds .
as democrats outnumber republicans by five to one here , fundraising for the real election fight in the so-called " battleground states " where the parties are close , is the chief preoccupation .
one activist organises weekly jogs through central park under the banner " run against bush " .
others organise telethons where people gather one evening a week to use their free cell phone minutes , and call voters in key states like ohio or florida .
the anarchic element of meetup culture is at once its greatest strength , and also a weakness for the centralised campaign teams .
the kerry and bush regional headquarters want to harness the power of grassroots activists , but also must accept that they have no executive authority over them .
being " on message " goes against the meetup ethos .
ms harleman was also keen to remind the group that the presidency is not the only thing at stake : " if the republicans keep congress and we lose the senate race , we 're looking at 15-20 years of republican control .
a democrat president is only part of it . "

and for frank clark , the visit to the anglo-german graveyard at douvres-la-delivrande is particularly poignant .
mr clark , 80 , from leicester , watched two friends die in front of him two weeks after they took sword beach together in the king 's own scottish borderers .
the two graves are a few feet apart and he marks each with a poppy .
one of the men was 21 and had been married for only three months .
when you 've sweated with them , eaten with them and shared food with them , then you 're like brothers frank clark he said : " we 'd just got out of the dugout and were walking up the road when the shelling started again .
" they shouted ' nobby ' and one had blood coming out of his ear , the other had blood out of his nose .
they died in my arms .
" when you 've sweated with them , eaten with them and shared food with them , then you 're like brothers . "
some of the most emotional moments come in this way .
equality another veteran finds the grave he has been searching for , bows his head for a moment in silence , salutes with his trembling right hand and receives a consoling hug from his son .
the cemetery has 927 british graves , 180 german , 11 canadian , 3 australian , one polish and one unknown .
the germans are buried in the quietest corner of the immaculately kept graveyard , away from the main road into bayeux .
the cemetery contains graves of fallen allied and german soldiers the headstones have the war graves commission shape of their british counterparts and unlike at other cemeteries , they are not black .
for the visiting british , this equality is not a problem .
robert gamble , 79 , from leicester , said : " we were all doing the same thing and they 're someone 's son , are n't they ?
" my cousin married a member of a u-boat and i was in a destroyer trying to sink u-boats ! "
' it breaks me up ' the visitors are not just the elderly .
daniel mangan , seven , from liverpool , is there with his father graham , 38 .
daniel said : " it 's sad the soldiers died so young . "
his father added : " we 've come over for the commemoration .
i 'm an ex-soldier and i never drive past a cemetery without stopping .
now i 'm trying to instil in him the same respect .
it upsets me every time i come . "
the cemetery is immaculately kept five minutes drive away , there are 2,048 canadians resting at beny-sur-mer-reviers .
jan de vries , 80 , from ontario , of the 1st canadian parachute battalion , is one of 10 veterans returning to lay poppies dropped from parachutes last year .
" what always get me are the inscriptions , they really break me up .
" when we go to ranville cemetery i recall the names -lrb- of friends -rrb- and have to stop . "
he said the canadian contribution used to be overlooked but that was changing , thanks in part to a juno beach centre he helped to set up .
" we have a population of 11 million and we had 1.1 million in uniform in world war two .
