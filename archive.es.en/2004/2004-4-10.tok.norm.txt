as they watched statues of saddam hussein being toppled , many syrians wondered whether the day would come when statues of the late syrian president hafez el assad would also be brought down .
syrian officials anxiously watched the events unfold and wondered whether they would meet the same fate as their iraqi counterparts .
but one year on , if there is anything that syrians and their government agree about , it is that the american way is not the way to bring about change .
breathing space still , with american tanks just 250km -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from damascus , syrian officials must have had many sleepless nights over the last year .
president bashar al-assad 's regime clings to the hope that the us will remain too busy in iraq to look next door .
other events in the middle east are also giving syria some breathing space .
us president george bush had been about to slap sanctions on syria when hamas ' spiritual leader sheikh ahmad yassin was killed - the sanctions were postponed so as not to increase tension in the region .
but even a week into the iraq war last year , washington 's sights were already on syria .
the us accused damascus of supporting saddam hussein 's regime by sending military equipment to iraq and allowing arab volunteers to cross the border to fight american troops in iraq .
it has also accused syria of supporting radical militant palestinian groups such as hamas .
skirmishes the border remains a source of friction , with the us repeatedly accusing the syrian authorities of not doing enough to prevent fighters from crossing into iraq .
for a few weeks during the war itself , hundreds of young arab men were bussed into iraq .
syria says its border with iraq is too long to control tightly and refers again and again to the difficulties the us faces in controlling its border with mexico .
last month , one american and one syrian soldier were killed in skirmishes on the border .
newspapers in lebanon reported this week that , following the incidents , the us changed jurisdiction of syria and lebanon from us command in europe to central command in qatar .
one opposition figure in damascus , who wished to remain anonymous , said syria was wrong to think it could get away with doing as little as possible for as long as possible in terms of responding to american demands .
" this time syria will not be let off the hook .
the us is serious about its threats towards damascus , " he said .
" the us preparations for the iraq war took several years , from setting up an opposition abroad , to sanctions and so on .
but in just seven months , the us has already done all of the same in relation to syria , " he added .
other observers say washington will not do more than impose symbolic sanctions on damascus .
challenged still , there is a growing sense in syria that the baath regime can be challenged as it faces uncertain times following the collapse of its iraqi counterpart .
last month , kurds in syria rioted after several were shot by police during a football match .
in the following days , more clashes took place and statues of the late president assad were defaced in the kurdish areas in the north-east of syria .
but as syrians watch events unfold across the border , they are worried about the void that would be left behind if the regime was brought down or collapsed .
more and more intellectuals and human rights activists are openly calling on the syrian regime to bring about change itself .

but even a week into the iraq war last year , washington 's sights were already on syria .
the us accused damascus of supporting saddam hussein 's regime by sending military equipment to iraq and allowing arab volunteers to cross the border to fight american troops in iraq .
it has also accused syria of supporting radical militant palestinian groups such as hamas .
skirmishes the border remains a source of friction , with the us repeatedly accusing the syrian authorities of not doing enough to prevent fighters from crossing into iraq .
for a few weeks during the war itself , hundreds of young arab men were bussed into iraq .
syria says its border with iraq is too long to control tightly and refers again and again to the difficulties the us faces in controlling its border with mexico .
last month , one american and one syrian soldier were killed in skirmishes on the border .
will statues of late syrian president , hafez assad , be toppled one day ?
newspapers in lebanon reported this week that , following the incidents , the us changed jurisdiction of syria and lebanon from us command in europe to central command in qatar .
one opposition figure in damascus , who wished to remain anonymous , said syria was wrong to think it could get away with doing as little as possible for as long as possible in terms of responding to american demands .
" this time syria will not be let off the hook .
the us is serious about its threats towards damascus , " he said .
" the us preparations for the iraq war took several years , from setting up an opposition abroad , to sanctions and so on .
but in just seven months , the us has already done all of the same in relation to syria , " he added .
other observers say washington will not do more than impose symbolic sanctions on damascus .
challenged still , there is a growing sense in syria that the baath regime can be challenged as it faces uncertain times following the collapse of its iraqi counterpart .
last month , kurds in syria rioted after several were shot by police during a football match .
in the following days , more clashes took place and statues of the late president assad were defaced in the kurdish areas in the north-east of syria .
but as syrians watch events unfold across the border , they are worried about the void that would be left behind if the regime was brought down or collapsed .
more and more intellectuals and human rights activists are openly calling on the syrian regime to bring about change itself .

forty great bustard chicks will be brought over from the saratov region of russia in june , with the help of uk government and european funding .
they will be taken to wiltshire for rearing and eventual release .
a government licence to import the chicks was granted last november after a five-year campaign by enthusiasts .
the great bustard once roamed grassland areas from the west country to the scottish borders but was last seen in britain in 1832 .
it is now found in northern europe and parts of spain and the aim is to try to re-establish breeding birds in the english countryside .
former police officer david waters , from wiltshire , has already invested £ 40,000 in the project .
we will be introducing them to a stuffed fox as part of predator awareness training dr patrick osborne , a senior lecturer at stirling university he told a london news conference : " the chicks will be one or two weeks old and will be transported by air from moscow to london around 1 june . "
environment minister ben bradshaw said : " this is the first attempt ever in england , and certainly the first since the 1970s in the uk as a whole , to re-introduce a species that was once resident here but is now extinct .
" the great bustard has been extinct since 1832 as a breeding bird and largely as a result of hunting by human beings .
" eggs are going to be collected in the soviet union from nests that are threatened with destruction .

" we do n't want the chicks to see people but we will be introducing them to a stuffed fox as part of predator awareness training , " he said .
great bustards , which are omnivorous and include seeds , insects , moles and rats in their diet , nest in fields of crops and are thought to live for up to 25 years .
adult males , which perform an elaborate courtship dance to attract females , can weigh up to 16kg and resemble a cross between a turkey and a golden eagle in flight .

forty great bustard chicks will be brought over from the saratov region of russia in june , with the help of uk government and european funding .
they will be taken to wiltshire for rearing and eventual release .
a government licence to import the chicks was granted last november after a five-year campaign by enthusiasts .
the great bustard once roamed grassland areas from the west country to the scottish borders but was last seen in britain in 1832 .
it is now found in northern europe and parts of spain and the aim is to try to re-establish breeding birds in the english countryside .
former police officer david waters , from wiltshire , has already invested £ 40,000 in the project .
we will be introducing them to a stuffed fox as part of predator awareness training dr patrick osborne , a senior lecturer at stirling university he told a london news conference : " the chicks will be one or two weeks old and will be transported by air from moscow to london around 1 june . "
environment minister ben bradshaw said : " this is the first attempt ever in england , and certainly the first since the 1970s in the uk as a whole , to re-introduce a species that was once resident here but is now extinct .
" the great bustard has been extinct since 1832 as a breeding bird and largely as a result of hunting by human beings .
" eggs are going to be collected in the soviet union from nests that are threatened with destruction .
" they will be hatched out there and brought over here as chicks and kept for a while in pens on salisbury plain .
then when we are as confident as we can be that they have acclimatised they will be released into the wild . "
the birds will be reared in wiltshire dr patrick osborne , senior lecturer in environmental studies at stirling university , said 40 chicks would be brought from russia and have a quarantine period .

the call to partners of those receiving disability benefits has been met with distrust by some carers over the way the government announced the drive .
a letter from the department of work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- was recently sent out requesting carers attend interviews at job centres from mid-april .
government figures estimate there are nearly 5.7m carers in britain .
' close to tears ' the work britain 's millions of carers do - most of it unpaid - is acknowledged as saving social services billions of pounds .
linda nash is a full-time carer of her husband , david , who has been disabled for 16 years .
the couple recently received a letter informing them mrs nash , who lives in elvington in kent , must attend an interview at a job centre to discuss how she could re-enter the job market .
it felt like everything i 'd done over the years was just washed away by this letter linda nash , full-time carer the couple received the letter because mr nash receives incapacity benefit and his partner , linda , does not work .
the letter had an emotional effect on mrs nash .
" i was very , very upset and near to tears , " she said .
" it felt like everything i 'd done over the years was just washed away by this letter .
" it seemed as if they did n't have any understanding of the issues of care and disability , " she added .
the letter threatened to cut her husband 's benefits if she did not turn up for the job centre interview .
" even the benefit enquiry line did n't know anything about this , " she said .
' unrecognised ' carers uk does know about the plans and has received many enquiries from concerned callers .
its chief executive , imelda redman , said a common reaction from carers to the letter was that their role and contribution was not being recognised .
