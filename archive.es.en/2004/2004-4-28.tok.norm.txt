a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .
sahin 's deputy , rolf königs , added : " we belong there .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .

the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .

inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .

the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 libyan leader pitches tent in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi , left , gave his visitor a warm welcome meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- german ship seized with uranium-making parts for libya officials have confirmed that a german-flagged ship was carrying parts to build a nuclear bomb from a persian gulf country to libya in october .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "

in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .
reinhard baumgarten , cairo correspondent for german public broadcaster ard -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- german ship seized with uranium-making parts for libya officials have confirmed that a german-flagged ship was carrying parts to build a nuclear bomb from a persian gulf country to libya in october .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .
the government apparently is continuing to investigate the sale despite the chinese announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanau plutonium plant earlier a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry had said that chinese companies had cancelled negotiations with german technology giant siemens , the owner of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .
the government apparently is continuing to investigate the sale despite the chinese announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanau plutonium plant earlier a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry had said that chinese companies had cancelled negotiations with german technology giant siemens , the owner of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt .
the spokesperson added that he did n't expect the issue to come up during chinese premier wen jiabao 's trip to germany next week . a siemens spokesperson declined to comment on the matter , saying that the company would wait until the german government had completed its review . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's buy a nuclear plant a group of german politicians , activists and celebrities has set up a web site asking for donations to buy a plutonium processing plant in the town of hanau before the government sells it to china .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .

how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .

on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 opinion : gadhafi 's about face could bring political change to libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's been everything but an angel in the past .
the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .
reinhard baumgarten , cairo correspondent for german public broadcaster ard -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- german ship seized with uranium-making parts for libya officials have confirmed that a german-flagged ship was carrying parts to build a nuclear bomb from a persian gulf country to libya in october .
investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination .
-lrb- jan .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .

prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .

the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .
the government apparently is continuing to investigate the sale despite the chinese announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanau plutonium plant earlier a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry had said that chinese companies had cancelled negotiations with german technology giant siemens , the owner of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt .

rules are an important part of german life , but when berlin police officers fined a woman for laughing too late at night , even law-abiding judges had to giggle a little . laughter may be the best medicine for many people .
for one german , however , it is a reason to complain .
the 52-year-old berlin man made an official complaint about a female neighbour 's laugh which resulted in police involvement last december .
the 47-year-old woman , identified only as barbara m. , invited co-workers from her architectural firm to her apartment in the moabit district of berlin .
" it was a working dinner and , after things got going , there was a good deal of laughter , " she told the court .
next thing she knew , police officers banged on the door at 22:30 , saying her downstairs neighbour had complained about " four hours of sustained , raucous laughter " .
unemployed bernd f. , who lives with his mother , had pointed out that it is against the law in germany to make too much noise after 10 p.m.
to top it off , barbara subsequently received a formal complaint from district authorities demanding she pay a € 25 fine for " loud laughter between 18:00 and 22:30 " .
but she got the last laugh when she took the matter to court , where a judge threw out the fine , calling it " laughable " , according to a report in the berliner kurier newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .

the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .

european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2004 european commission defends stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's man for economic and monetary issues : joaquin almunia while urging a court to reinstate the eu commission 's authority after member states waived penalties for germany and france last year , the union 's executive pressed ahead with its budget policing duties on wednesday . the european court of justice in luxembourg on wednesday began deliberating in the legal dispute between the european commission and eu member states over accusations that finance ministers had no legal basis to suspend disciplinary action last year against germany and france for violating the terms of the stability and growth pact .
the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .

portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "

with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .
sahin 's deputy , rolf königs , added : " we belong there .

but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 where is europe headed ?
back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .

the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .

an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .

in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "

though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .

sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .

germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .

and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .

china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .
the government apparently is continuing to investigate the sale despite the chinese announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanau plutonium plant earlier a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry had said that chinese companies had cancelled negotiations with german technology giant siemens , the owner of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .
" our single currency , the euro , is young and we have to ensure that our policies are transparent and predictable " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .
the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .
china had denied planning to use the plant in the production of nuclear weapons . " we 're happy about the chinese decision , " greens party co-chairs reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer said after hearing about beijing 's change of heart .
their party colleague and germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , appeared more diplomatic , however . " we have n't completed the process , " fischer told reporters , referring to the internal government review of the sale that has been going on for months .
the government apparently is continuing to investigate the sale despite the chinese announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanau plutonium plant earlier a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry had said that chinese companies had cancelled negotiations with german technology giant siemens , the owner of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .

the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .

germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .

a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu . further cementing their long-existing trade and immigration relationship , germany and turkey have created an officially sanctioned haven for starting and supporting business ventures .
for turkey , germany is its most important trading partner , while turkey ranks 18th on germany 's list : a valuable and tightly woven connection for both countries .
despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 libyan leader pitches tent in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi , left , gave his visitor a warm welcome meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

the survey showed that consumers were feeling slightly happier about their income situation and the general economic outlook , but were still not willing to make any large-scale purchases .
" the consumer climate is like april showers , " gfk said .
" the constant ups and downs in consumer indicators seen in recent months - a clear sign of how nervous germans are - continued this month . "
the poll , conducted on behalf of the european commission and based on a poll of about 2,000 people , monitors consumers ' economic expectations , income expectations and their propensity to spend .
gfk 's headline index slipped to 5 points in april from 5.1 points in march , but is expected to rise fractionally to 5.2 points in may , the research group said . more briefs 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 26.04.2004 -pipe- retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy 26.04.2004 -pipe- mitsubishi motors head steps down 23.04.2004 -pipe- abu dhabi interested in buying large stake in vw radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2004 european commission defends stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's man for economic and monetary issues : joaquin almunia while urging a court to reinstate the eu commission 's authority after member states waived penalties for germany and france last year , the union 's executive pressed ahead with its budget policing duties on wednesday . the european court of justice in luxembourg on wednesday began deliberating in the legal dispute between the european commission and eu member states over accusations that finance ministers had no legal basis to suspend disciplinary action last year against germany and france for violating the terms of the stability and growth pact .
the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .
" our single currency , the euro , is young and we have to ensure that our policies are transparent and predictable " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

i think yes .
in my view we can turn to public opinion , which is strongly in favour of the european union . "
however kwasniewski felt it was doubtful whether parliament could marshal the necessary two-thirds support to endorse the constitution .
the polish president also stressed that his country , which for so long held out against a new voting system in the constitution , is now willing to compromise .
poland would be prepared to compromise if the new constitution allowed an " emergency brake " mechanism , under which the new voting system could be set aside for issues of vital national importance .
" the proposed safety elements , in my opinion , could be enough for polish public opinion , " kwasniewski said .
meanwhile in other countries the pressure to hold a referendum is also high .
a survey conducted by the csa institute in france found that 74 percent of those asked were in favour of a referendum .
the constitution has to be approved by all 25 member states for it to come into force .

the newspaper reported that only irish and british nationals will be granted full access to its job market from may 1 .
so far only these two countries have not imposed barriers on the movement of workers from the new eu member states - although access to social welfare has been restricted .
sweden may well be another as its parliament today is expected to vote against imposing restrictions .
but it is not only eu countries that will be hit , norway , iceland and liechtenstein are also on the black list .

at a press conference in luxembourg , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov announced that moscow would sign the deal provisionally .
the announcement comes after months of russian refusal to sign an extension to the partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- unless certain concerns were dealt with .
the eu had insisted that the pca be extended automatically causing a stalemate that lasted for months .
the hurdle was eventually overcome with an agreement that the two sides would make a joint declaration on some of russia ’ s concerns in parallel with the announcement of the pca extension .
according to diplomats , a deal had been close this week but for a dispute over the status of the russian minorities particularly in latvia and estonia .
in the end , the joint declaration did not specifically refer to russian minorities but to minorities in general .
however , the two baltic states are angry that the status of their minorities was allowed to be brought into such sharp focus .
the deal will have to be formally approved by the european parliament and the russian duma before formally coming into force .

at a press conference in luxembourg , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov announced that moscow would sign the deal provisionally .
the announcement comes after months of russian refusal to sign an extension to the partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- unless certain concerns were dealt with .
the eu had insisted that the pca be extended automatically causing a stalemate that lasted for months .
the hurdle was eventually overcome with an agreement that the two sides would make a joint declaration on some of russia ’ s concerns in parallel with the announcement of the pca extension .
according to diplomats , a deal had been close this week but for a dispute over the status of the russian minorities particularly in latvia and estonia .
in the end , the joint declaration did not specifically refer to russian minorities but to minorities in general .
however , the two baltic states are angry that the status of their minorities was allowed to be brought into such sharp focus .
the deal will have to be formally approved by the european parliament and the russian duma before formally coming into force .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .

in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

rules are an important part of german life , but when berlin police officers fined a woman for laughing too late at night , even law-abiding judges had to giggle a little . laughter may be the best medicine for many people .
for one german , however , it is a reason to complain .

the 47-year-old woman , identified only as barbara m. , invited co-workers from her architectural firm to her apartment in the moabit district of berlin .
" it was a working dinner and , after things got going , there was a good deal of laughter , " she told the court .
next thing she knew , police officers banged on the door at 22:30 , saying her downstairs neighbour had complained about " four hours of sustained , raucous laughter " .
unemployed bernd f. , who lives with his mother , had pointed out that it is against the law in germany to make too much noise after 10 p.m.
to top it off , barbara subsequently received a formal complaint from district authorities demanding she pay a € 25 fine for " loud laughter between 18:00 and 22:30 " .
but she got the last laugh when she took the matter to court , where a judge threw out the fine , calling it " laughable " , according to a report in the berliner kurier newspaper .
" the sound of human laughter and , for that matter human crying , is a generally accepted part of life , " the judge said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man evicted for laughing a jolly berliner whose proclivity for giggling irritated his neighbours and landlord has been evicted on charges of laughing too often , too loudly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.04.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc germans say they want referendums in california , they 've led to the legalization of cannabis for medical uses and the recall of a governor , paving the way for arnold schwarzenegger 's election .
now an overwhelming majority of germans also want to have their say by holding referendums .
the problem is , they 're currently banned by germany 's " basic law , " the country 's de facto constitution .
but 84 percent of germans would like to see that change , according to a survey released this week by pollster forsa for the hamburg-based magazine stern .
germans also want to have their say on a european constitution , with 74 percent saying they want to be able to vote on the final draft of the historic document .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2004 european commission defends stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's man for economic and monetary issues : joaquin almunia while urging a court to reinstate the eu commission 's authority after member states waived penalties for germany and france last year , the union 's executive pressed ahead with its budget policing duties on wednesday . the european court of justice in luxembourg on wednesday began deliberating in the legal dispute between the european commission and eu member states over accusations that finance ministers had no legal basis to suspend disciplinary action last year against germany and france for violating the terms of the stability and growth pact .
the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2004 european commission defends stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's man for economic and monetary issues : joaquin almunia while urging a court to reinstate the eu commission 's authority after member states waived penalties for germany and france last year , the union 's executive pressed ahead with its budget policing duties on wednesday . the european court of justice in luxembourg on wednesday began deliberating in the legal dispute between the european commission and eu member states over accusations that finance ministers had no legal basis to suspend disciplinary action last year against germany and france for violating the terms of the stability and growth pact .
the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .
" our single currency , the euro , is young and we have to ensure that our policies are transparent and predictable " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .

" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

at a press conference in luxembourg , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov announced that moscow would sign the deal provisionally .
the announcement comes after months of russian refusal to sign an extension to the partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- unless certain concerns were dealt with .
the eu had insisted that the pca be extended automatically causing a stalemate that lasted for months .
the hurdle was eventually overcome with an agreement that the two sides would make a joint declaration on some of russia ’ s concerns in parallel with the announcement of the pca extension .
according to diplomats , a deal had been close this week but for a dispute over the status of the russian minorities particularly in latvia and estonia .
in the end , the joint declaration did not specifically refer to russian minorities but to minorities in general .
however , the two baltic states are angry that the status of their minorities was allowed to be brought into such sharp focus .
the deal will have to be formally approved by the european parliament and the russian duma before formally coming into force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2004 european commission defends stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's man for economic and monetary issues : joaquin almunia while urging a court to reinstate the eu commission 's authority after member states waived penalties for germany and france last year , the union 's executive pressed ahead with its budget policing duties on wednesday . the european court of justice in luxembourg on wednesday began deliberating in the legal dispute between the european commission and eu member states over accusations that finance ministers had no legal basis to suspend disciplinary action last year against germany and france for violating the terms of the stability and growth pact .
the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .
" our single currency , the euro , is young and we have to ensure that our policies are transparent and predictable " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

i think yes .
in my view we can turn to public opinion , which is strongly in favour of the european union . "
however kwasniewski felt it was doubtful whether parliament could marshal the necessary two-thirds support to endorse the constitution .
the polish president also stressed that his country , which for so long held out against a new voting system in the constitution , is now willing to compromise .
poland would be prepared to compromise if the new constitution allowed an " emergency brake " mechanism , under which the new voting system could be set aside for issues of vital national importance .
" the proposed safety elements , in my opinion , could be enough for polish public opinion , " kwasniewski said .
meanwhile in other countries the pressure to hold a referendum is also high .
a survey conducted by the csa institute in france found that 74 percent of those asked were in favour of a referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 opinion : gadhafi 's about face could bring political change to libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's been everything but an angel in the past .
the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .
reinhard baumgarten , cairo correspondent for german public broadcaster ard -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- german ship seized with uranium-making parts for libya officials have confirmed that a german-flagged ship was carrying parts to build a nuclear bomb from a persian gulf country to libya in october .
investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination .

i think yes .
in my view we can turn to public opinion , which is strongly in favour of the european union . "
however kwasniewski felt it was doubtful whether parliament could marshal the necessary two-thirds support to endorse the constitution .
the polish president also stressed that his country , which for so long held out against a new voting system in the constitution , is now willing to compromise .
poland would be prepared to compromise if the new constitution allowed an " emergency brake " mechanism , under which the new voting system could be set aside for issues of vital national importance .
" the proposed safety elements , in my opinion , could be enough for polish public opinion , " kwasniewski said .
meanwhile in other countries the pressure to hold a referendum is also high .
a survey conducted by the csa institute in france found that 74 percent of those asked were in favour of a referendum .
the constitution has to be approved by all 25 member states for it to come into force .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?

martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .
a ' wave of labor migration ' from eastern european countries is n't expected , not least because of the transition period where there 'll be no free movement of labor .
it 'll be primarily highly skilled workers and specialists , as well as workers from border regions with limited immigration status who will be trying their luck on the labor markets of the western european states .
and this is hardly expected to have a large impact on the german job market . next page : part ii 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .

will expansion bring more unemployment and immigration ?
is it affordable ?
will it increase crime ?
martin brusis of the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich answers 12 questions about expansion . 1 .
is eu expansion necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin brusis yes , because it will overcome the institutional division of europe that has continued for over a decade after the end of the cold war .
but more than anything , expansion will increase political and economic stability in europe .
the new member countries will be drawn into the complex negotiating process of the eu , whereby conflicting interests between states are worked out in detail through diverse legal and procedural guidelines , through alliances with other states , and through intensive multilateral cooperation on many different administrative levels .
conflicts are n't allowed to escalate into hostilities , because too many other common interests are at stake .
the nature of the eu system is measured and temperate , and that 's been having an effect on the new member states since the beginning of the expansion process .
and it also hinders the likelihood that any of these states could fall back into an authoritarian system . 2 .
what economic advantages are to be gained from expansion ? the economic interdependence and the catching-up process that eastern europe is undergoing should have the effect of additional economic growth for the new and old eu states .
germany is profiting from trade in eastern europe .
in 2001 , exports to the region accounted for over 11 percent of german exports - that 's an increase of almost 17 percent from 2000 .
exports to eastern europe now rival german exports to the united states .
in the same year , germany 's trade balance with eastern europe amounted to almost € 1 billion .
according to the european commission , eastward expansion will mean an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent economic growth per year for the current 15 eu members .
the countries that will profit the most are germany and austria : here , the commission reckons with a yearly growth increase of up to 1 percent . 3 .
what about the risks ? if the various governments are n't able to get the draft european constitution approved , then after expansion , the eu 's decision making process could be paralyzed .
in that case , the european integration process could increasingly be superseded by different forms of bilateral cooperation .
and after all the past history of tension among some states , that entails big risks .
another risk comes from the populist parties and movements in europe , who are using the eastward expansion to spread fear among citizens , and then mobilizing this fear for their own purposes . 4 .
how is expansion being paid for , and is it affordable ? within the scope of the eu 's budget for the years 2004-2006 , expenses of € 40.85 billion have been earmarked for the new member states .
germany 's share of the eu budget for the years 2000-2006 averages at about 23 percent , so germany has to bring about € 9.4 billion to the table to help finance expansion .
this sum is affordable , especially if you view it in terms of the expected economic growth that will result from expansion .
an expected growth of 1 percent of germany 's gross domestic product is equivalent to around € 19.82 billion .
however , the financing for expansion beyond 2006 has yet to be decided .
if one were to simply extrapolate and transfer the eu 's current spending policies to the new member states , there could be an enormous increase in costs beyond 2006 .
the direct payment of subsidies to farmers in the new member states that was agreed on during accession talks is especially problematic .
the new and old states need to come to an agreement on a future financing of the eu that both reflects the political priorities of european integration and is in accordance with the eu 's principles of solidarity . 5 .
how will expansion affect everyday life ? in the old member states , people will hardly notice a change because the new freedom of movement will only be introduced after a transition period of two to seven years .
similarly , the border controls will only start to be lifted after a longer transition period .
even as a tourist , in years immediately following expansion , you 'll still have to pay with the old national currencies in the new member states .
but thanks to harmonised eu standards on quality , consumers of european goods will be guaranteed better products . 6 .
how will expansion affect unemployment ? structurally weak border regions , low-skilled laborers and wage cost-intensive branches will have to reckon with increased competition from the new member states , and increased unemployment .
but these effects are n't solely the result of eastward expansion .
they 're primarily the effects of globalization generally , and would have happened with or without expansion .
on the other hand , the expected growth in trade could create , or at least maintain jobs in other branches or regions .
economists predict that the eu 's trade balance with poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia will have the immediate effect of securing around 65,000 jobs -lrb- 44,000 in germany -rrb- in manufacturing industries , and could indirectly secure as many as 114,000 jobs -lrb- 77,000 in germany -rrb- .

back to first page back 2/2 7 .
what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

what will happen to wage levels in an expanded eu ? since labor migration from the new member states will be relatively low , and because the economic power of the new states will be rather limited , wage levels in the current eu states are n't really going to be affected by expansion .
in the border regions , in sectors that are wage cost-intensive , and when it comes to low-skilled workers , there will however be more competition , and with it , more pressure to lower wage levels .
in the new member states , there could be slight increases in wage levels due to increased productivity levels . 8 .
will there be a massive migration movement ? the amount of migration depends on how large a gap there is in living standards between eastern and western europe , as well as on the labor market status in both the country of origin and the destination country , and of course , the way potential migrants perceive their future prospects .
expansion will have a positive influence on all three of these factors , and so , to a certain extent , it will limit the potential for migration . 9 .
do you think expansion will strengthen europe 's position on the world stage ? yes , because expansion also means expanding the european domestic market by about 170 million citizens , that 's about 45 percent of the current eu population .
whether europe utilizes this potential though depends on whether the member states are able to develop common foreign , security and defense policies . 10 .
is there a chance that organized crime will go up as a result of expansion ? a connection between expansion and the rate of organized crime exists only so far as expansion causes living standards to rise , because that could have a mitigating effect on organized crime .
the new and old member states have already started to work closely together on areas such as security and crime-fighting .
the adoption of the schengen treaty provisions , the strengthening of europol as well as the transfer of financial means and know-how , are all helping the new member states to be more effective in the fight against organized crime .
the border controls between the old and new member states will only be relaxed when the new states are in a position to effectively control their part of the eu 's new external borders . 11 .
how is expansion being viewed by super-powers such as china , the u.s. and russia ? the u.s. is in favor of expansion because it 's seen as an important way of bringing stability and democracy to eastern europe .
additionally , the new member states are helping to strengthen the transatlantic dimension of nato .
the u.s. has also repeatedly encouraged the eu to accept nato-member turkey into the fold .
whereas russia has traditionally viewed nato expansion with a degree of skepticism , it has n't raised any objections to eu expansion .
china sees the european union as one of the most important poles in a multi-polar world .
eu expansion is in china 's interests because it wants to have more economic cooperation with europe . 12 .
how many more members could the eu possibly take on ? for one thing , this depends on whether the current eu states are in a position to reform the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes to the point where a union of 25 members or more is still functional .
in order to achieve more functionality , more areas of policy need to be decided according to the principle of majority rules , and the european commission should in the future ratify its resolutions with the double majority of states and population , as suggested in the eu constitution .
in addition , whether the eu undergoes further expansion depends on the strategic and political sense of such a move .
for example , extending the possibility of membership to the balkan states is a useful tool to promote democracy , peace and stability there .
a southeast expansion seems like a sensible undertaking for the further development of this region .
at the same time , the eu should consider creating a " special neighbor " status , that would provide interested candidate countries with some of the benefits associated with member status .
then , countries such as turkey or ukraine would have a convincing alternative to full membership in the eu . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 opinion : gadhafi 's about face could bring political change to libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's been everything but an angel in the past .
the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 libyan leader pitches tent in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi , left , gave his visitor a warm welcome meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction . normally , guests of state in belgium are put up in the majestic val duchess chateau .
but libya 's moammar gadhafi is not a usual visitor - he 's here to restore relations after being shunned by the international community for the better part of two decades .
nor does his visit look normal , for gadhafi has eschewed the finer aspects of palace living and instead pitched a blue bedouin tent on the palace grounds .
indeed , gadhafi is as eccentric as ever .
outside the palace grounds , things only look a bit more like an official state visit .
welcomed with outstretched arms and dancing breaking with the usual eu protocol , european commission president romano prodi strode down the runway at brussels ' zaventem airport to personally greet the libyan leader , who was dressed in a flamboyant red fez hat and gray-green sweeping robe .
it is gadhafi 's first visit to europe in 15 years , and despite all that has transgressed since then , the eu is keen on making the ostracized leader feel welcome .
libya has made " remarkable progress " in shedding its rogue nation status , the eu said recently .
and on tuesday the commission rolled out the red carpet to gadhafi and hopes to welcome libya into the eu ’ s trade and security partnership with countries bordering the mediterranean as soon as possible .
for the libyan leader , who was greeted with a singing and dancing crowd of some 200 supporters in front of the commission headquarters , the trip to brussels is the first in a series of steps towards " full normalization " of relations with the eu .
inching back into the fold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am flight 103 at the site of its crash in lockerbie , scotland .
the official invitation to the european union headquarters is a further reward for gadhafi ’ s recent moves towards ending libya ’ s isolation from the international community .
the arab leader 's renunciation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in december followed libya ’ s acceptance earlier in the year of responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie , scotland , and another plane in niger in 1989 .
libya agreed to pay millions of euros in compensation to the families of the hundreds of victims .
for years gadhafi was shunned by the international community as an active supporter of terrorism .
sanctions were imposed on libya in 1986 by the united states and others following the bombing of the discotheque in west berlin frequented by american soldiers .
last week u.s. president george w. bush followed europe ’ s lead in lifting most of the commercial sanctions , but washington says it still needs to be completely convinced that libya no longer sponsors terrorism before it will remove the country from its terrorist blacklist and restore diplomatic relations .
germany resists immediate lifting of sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco the la belle discotheque bombing in berlin remains an obstacle to gadhafi ’ s ambitions to improve relations with the european union .
germany is still demanding compensation for the victims of that attack , and bulgaria has also raised objections to welcoming libya into the fold - at least until six bulgarian medics detained since 1999 on charges of deliberately infecting over 400 children with the hiv virus are released .
a libyan court is due to issue a verdict in the bulgarians ' case on may 6 .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer indicated on monday that he hopes these issues will soon be resolved .
" that would be very helpful , " fischer told a press conference in luxembourg .
" chances of getting all barriers out of the way are there . "
this would potentially clear the way for the european union to lift its arms embargo on libya , and for negotiations to begin on accepting libya as part of the barcelona process - an ongoing political cooperation covering trade , aid and security measures between the eu and 11 south and east mediterranean-rim countries .
-lrb- libya is currently the only country in the region that is not included in the partnership . -rrb-
european commission chief romano prodi said tuesday the eu wanted to admit libya to the regional partnership as soon as possible .
these two issues top gadhafi 's agenda in his meetings on tuesday with the eu executive , european commission president romano prodi and belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
charges of human rights abuses but the eu will also address the issue of libya ’ s poor human rights record .
a report released by the human rights organization amnesty international to coincide with gadhafi ’ s visit accuses libya of ongoing human rights violations , including torture and the detention and execution of political dissidents .
amnesty has called on gadhafi to make good his promise to abolish the death penalty and improve his human rights record .
eu officials said they would raise the issue of human rights with the libyan leader , but they acknowledged that geopolitics and the desire to reward an arab state which has renounced terrorism and nuclear , biological and chemical weapons took precedence .. dw staff -lrb- cc / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .

despite the ailing german economy , german exports to turkey rose by nearly one fifth last year .
germany exported € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- in goods to turkey in 2003 , while imports amounted to € 7.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder at the chamber 's opening .
underlining the importance of the opening of the chamber of commerce , german chancellor gerhard schröder and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan were present in cologne , along with other german and turkish business leaders .
these include representatives from daimler chrysler , the metro hypermarket chain , and deutsche bank .
the turkish-german chamber of commerce , known under its acronym td-ihk , is supported by the german retailers ' association and the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , as well as the turkish chamber of commerce or tobb .
the new organization has been in operation since late october , but its official opening ceremony is today .
the organization considers itself a place of support for anyone looking to invest in turkey or germany , and a provider of business contacts .
the president of the new organization , kemal sahin , called the chamber a " milestone in turkish - german economic relations . "
for his part , the head of the german chamber of commerce , peter presber , said the organization 's aim should be to " better integrate turkish companies in germany 's association structure . "
increasing turkish investments in germany the new chamber will help increase investment in germany , sahin said .
" turkish businesses have always been a flourishing part of the german economy .
by creating this chamber of commerce , this trend will be strengthened , " he said .
those involved also clearly hope that the new chamber will help strengthen turkey 's bid for european union membership .
though turkey is an official candidate nation , the eu has not yet given a date for the start of accession negotiations .
turkey has pushed through major democratic reforms , but the european parliament stated in a recent report that it is not yet ready for membership , citing the influence of the army in politics , continuing torture practices and the discrimination of religious minorities .
yet in a state visit to ankara in february , schröder indicated he is open to setting a date for talks on concrete criteria .
sahin said he hopes the opening of the chamber will provide the chance to " continue the fruitful dialog " with schröder .
" we want turkey to enter the european union , " sahin said .
sahin 's deputy , rolf königs , added : " we belong there .

the german government did n't want to comment , but green party politicians welcomed the move . many members of the greens , the junior coalition partner in the german government , opposed the plan for the sale ever since it became public during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to china last december . they objected to the € 50 million -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- deal because they said china could use the plant to produce weapons grade plutonium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .

indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .

in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .

several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "

in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .

what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

the court case " is not about economics , it 's about the legal interpretation of the treaty , " said commission spokesman gerassimos thomas .
last november the eu executive called for levying stiff financial punishment after germany and france - the euro zone 's two biggest budget sinners - recorded a deficit in excess of the stability pact 's three-percent limit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the third year running .
finance ministers from the member states , however , opposed the commission and voted against slapping berlin and paris with penalties .
instead the two violators got off with pledges to rein in their deficits by 2005 .
the economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the time , pedro solbes , accused the member states of breaking eu law by suspending disciplinary action and filed a lawsuit against them under a special fast-track process .
a verdict is expected within six months .
eu commission vs. member states the unprecedented court case triggered a rift between the eu executive and member states last year and pitted smaller countries , who maintain tight budgetary discipline , against larger repeat offenders such as germany and france .
the case also serves to lay out exactly what powers the commission has to enforce recommendations .
analysts say a loss for the commission , ostensibly the guardian of eu treaties , would likely erode its already weak enforcement power .
member states " have to approve all sanctions , " daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , told the associated press .
" the commission can only recommend them . "
brussels issues new warnings amidst the start of the court case , the economic and monetary affairs commission issued its latest round of recommendations .
britain and the netherlands , who exceeded the three-percent limit in 2003 , were let off the hook because the commission was convinced both were already coming back into line .
portugal , which was the first country to face disciplinary action in 2002 , was given a clean slate for managing to rein in its deficit for two years in a row .
the commission criticized italy for " significant slippage " in its projected 2004 deficit .
rather than achieving the target 2.2 percent of gdp , rome was seen as moving closer to 3.2 percent .
it recommended that the council of eu finance ministers issue italy an " early warning . "
" budgetary plans were recurrently based on overoptimistic growth assumptions , " the new economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said in remarks on wednesday , adding that rome 's problem was " almost entirely structural " and not due to outside factors .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has brushed off criticism from brussels in the past and was not ruffled by the latest statements .
early in the month deputy premier gianfranco fini told the italian news agency ansa the government was " unconcerned " by the warning because " it is certain that sanctions would not be accepted " by eu finance ministers .
last year , when germany and france were faced with penalties , italy joined them in calling for changes in the rule book and voted in favor of suspending disciplinary action .
almunia , who entered office this month , follows his predecessor solbes ' hardline stance against such stability pact violators .
although he endorses some reform of the rules to better reflect economic growth and public debt , he is against removing the three-percent limit , arguing that it is a cornerstone of eu economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 opinion : gadhafi 's about face could bring political change to libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's been everything but an angel in the past .
the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .
reinhard baumgarten , cairo correspondent for german public broadcaster ard -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- blair makes landmark trip to libya british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- german ship seized with uranium-making parts for libya officials have confirmed that a german-flagged ship was carrying parts to build a nuclear bomb from a persian gulf country to libya in october .
investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination .

the eu rolled out the red carpet for moammar ghadafi 's visit to brussels tuesday .
while their leader 's rapprochement with the international community is welcome , ultimately the libyans must decide what to do with him . nobody knows how many people were tortured to death in his prisons , driven crazy or mentally scarred : moammar gadhafi is an unscrupulous autocrat , a dictator .
he led libya into international isolation .
thanks to his ideological blindness , his absurd sense of mission and his expensive forays into foreign policy , resource-rich libya faces growing poverty and unemployment .
gadhafi wants to get out of the sidelines ; he wants his country to again become a fully-fledged member in the international community . the 62-year-old revolution leader is making a virtue of necessity .
the international sanctions , which started in the early 1990s , brought the 5.5 million libyans losses of up to $ 30 billion -lrb- € 25.2 billion -rrb- and badly hurt the libyan economy , above all , the oil industry .
without a radical change of course , colonel gadhafi recognized , he would never have been able to break the headlock . so gadhafi radically changed course .
libya took responsibility for the lockerbie bombing .
libya abandoned its programs to produce mass weapons of destruction .
libya developed - to the delight of london and even more so of washington - into a new partner in the arab world .
in iraq , in palestine , in saudi arabia and in syria - the americans ' dream of a changing middle east are n't a reality anywhere .
of all people , arch enemy gadhafi must make george w. bush 's campaigning heart beat faster . peaceful means prevailed still , the bush administration should bear one thing in mind : threats of violence did n't cause gadhafi to rethink - diplomatic tenacity , painful sanctions and economic pressure did .
the approach to the so-called " rogue state " libya is an example much more worth copying than the approach to " rogue state " iraq that is bogged down by chaos and violence . libya is returning to the fold of the international community , which is both good and important .
the eu as libya 's most important trade partner and a geographical neighbor should help yesterday 's pariah with its rehabilitation , if for no other reason than out of self-interest .
libya is important as an additional energy supplier and can help to stem illegal immigration from africa . but the eu should n't let gadhafi the autocrat off the hook or give him absolution .
gadhafi should be called to account for what he has done , but by his own people - if they want to .
the better libya is integrated into the international community , the greater the chances that the libyans will be able to demand and develop their political majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe dw-world : the eve of enlargement dw-world : verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit dw-world : a final report card for new eu members dw-world : where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 28.04.2004 europe 's new age of enlightenment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic and orthodox clerics at a mass in aachen , germany with the 10 new eu member states , the religious map of europe is also changing dramatically , bringing aboard catholics , the orthodox church and protestants .
what role do churches play in these countries today ? along with malta , poland is an exception in the european union : 95 percent of its citizens belong to the catholic church , and about half go to church services regularly on sundays .
poland is the biggest of the new member states , and it will add millions of devout catholics to the eu 's population .
but not everyone in poland see that as a positive development - many representatives of the church stood against warsaw 's entry into the eu .
they feared the western-atheist and secular tendencies of the eu could force undesired changes in a staunchly catholic society .
" the catholic religion is one for the poor people , " said magdalena loniak , a polish student .
" but that 's going to change when the people have a higher quality of life .
then they 'll be forced to become less devout . "
there 's plenty of anecdotal evidence to back up that claim through the experiences of other countries that have previously joined the eu .
just call it " political market forces . "
more wealth , less religion ?
both spain and portugal are fundamentally catholic countries .
but since they joined the eu in 1986 , both have seen a drop in the importance of religious life in their societies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not what you think : these hooded penitents are actually spanish catholics drawing analogies from spain and portugal 's membership with the current enlargement , however , is like comparing apples and oranges .
there 's a major difference this time around : the new members , with the exceptions of malta and cyprus , are all countries of the former eastern bloc .
in these areas , churches were often oppressed under communist regimes , and believers were persecuted .
rather than serving to drive people away from the church , however , state-supported oppression brought people closer to religion .
even today they have a tremendous sense of loyalty .
" what we experienced during the past 50 years was the spontaneous and selfless activities of the church as well as the pleasure christians got in taking the risk -lrb- of going to church -rrb- , " said hungarian religious scholar andrás máte-tóth .
those tight relations have n't changed in the run-up to eu membership .
indeed , slovenia and poland have fought vociferously for the word " god " to be written into the draft of europe 's first constitution .
and in spite of reservations from the eu , poland has also kept its rigid anti-abortion laws on the books .
slovenia , slovakia and lithuania also have catholic majority populations .
the only countries of the new member states with protestant majorities are estonia and latvia .
in some countries , state oppression of the church as well as massive secular indoctrination programs , like that in east germany , led to a situation where only a minority of the population practiced religion .
a return to church pews ?
in a joint study , máte-tóth and academic paul zulehner found that the czech republic was the least christian region in europe - along with eastern germany .
walter schwimmer , general secretary of the council of europe , said he believes it plausible that eu membership could actually lead to an upsurge in church activity in some of the member states where religion languished or even suffocated under communism .
in a somewhat flawed comparison , schwimmer points to albania in the balkans .
" albania was the world 's first atheist state , " he notes .
but today the country is dominated by islam .
the only religious certainty about accession is that europe 's about to become more pluralistic .
but that 's not to say religious diversity did n't already exist in the existing eu states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diodoros i , greek orthodox patriarch if you go purely by the numbers , most eu citizens are catholic .
several countries like denmark and sweden are almost 100 percent protestant .
greece , meanwhile , is an almost entirely orthodox nation .
an equal number are totally heterogeneous : germany and france are home to several million muslims each .
the united kingdom is also home to sizable hindu and sikh populations .
the relationship between church and state also varies greatly among the existing eu members .
" in britain , for example , the queen is the official head of the state church , the anglican church , " said schwimmer .
" then , there 's france , which is a secular state .
germany and austria also have a totally different church-state relationship . "
future members to bring religious diversity the next wave of eu accession , expected in 2007 , will bring with it a raft of members of the orthodox church who represent the majority of people bulgaria and romania .
in romania , most baptisms outside the orthodox church are barely recognized , says corina golgorziu , a student who is also a baptized orthodox .
though romania has much progress still to be made on the religious anti-discrimination front , golgoriziu believes the country 's eventual membership in the eu could have an eye-opening effect on its people " that there are other religions in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims praying during the month of ramadan that could have a domino effect on turkey if it eventually becomes a member .
with its membership , the overwhelmingly muslim turkey would also bring about a tectonic shift to europe 's religious map .
but european leaders believe they are up to the challenge that new diversity will bring .
prodi : we 're building a pluralist europe " as we build the new , enlarged europe , we can not marginalize religions and the movements that have played a part in european integration and europe 's cultural development and that are showing renewed interest and desire for dialogue with the union 's institutions , " european commission president romano prodi said in a 2003 speech .
" acknowledging this heritage does not send a message of rejection or inclusion .
europe 's true strength lies in its capacity to mix and blend vastly different influences and cultures .
how can we leave christianity , judaism and islam out of the picture in the open , pluralist europe we want to build ? "
in a recent policy paper , the eu suggested consulting regularly with the major churches represented in the union when legislation that concerns them is being considered .
that , perhaps , would give churches a voice in legislative debates over controversial issues like the pro life vs. pro-abortion debate , therapeutic and reproductive cloning and the commercialization of stem cell lines .
but it could also help unify the churches in a region whose history has been marked time and time again by religious rifts . elena griepentrog -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe 's integration challenge as the definition of what is european evolves , dw-world looks at the integration challenges facing germany and the rest of the continent .

the post will be created at edinburgh university 's royal -lrb- dick -rrb- school of veterinary studies in august .
it will be funded by a charitable body which promotes research into pets ' medical and surgical problems .
there has been an increase in rabbits which are obese , have gut problems or suffer from overgrown teeth .
anna meredith , head of the exotic animals service at the veterinary school , said rabbits were becoming more popular pets .
friendly and responsive " i think rabbits are filling a need now .
people 's lives are becoming busier and they still want to keep pets but cats and dogs can be quite time-consuming , " she said .
" rabbits actually make very good companion animals .
they are friendly and responsive . "
ms meredith said that domestic rabbits used to live to the age of four or five but better diet and care had extended their live expectancy .
however , many rabbits were often overfed and had become obese .
the new post will be a three-year position offered to a junior vet who has a particular interest in rabbits .
the idea is to increase knowledge of rabbit medicine and study diseases to which the animal is susceptible .

your shopping trolley is heaving , but there are no queues at the checkout and scanning the lot takes only seconds .
a new line of clothing is a sell-out success .
instead of waiting weeks for fresh supplies , your logistics manager knows within seconds which warehouse on the route from thailand to the uk has the clothes in the right colour and size and fast-tracks them through the supply chain .
a complex machine refuses to operate .
it checked out the worker - he wears the right kind of protective clothing - but also knows he has not completed the training that qualifies him for the job .
every second counts .
the nurse tracking down a life-saving heart-lung machine finds it instantly because the equipment broadcasts its exact location .
a thief slips five packs of expensive razor blades into his jacket , but the smart shelf knows that an unusually large number of blades has been taken off and alerts security guards .
this is not futuristic .
thanks to a new generation of " radio frequency identification " -lrb- rfid -rrb- tags the last two examples are already on trial , while the others could be reality in three to six years ' time .
the world 's largest retailer , wal-mart , has told its top 100 suppliers to get rfid-ready by january 2005 - or lose the business .
experts predict that from 2006 onwards rfid systems will be rolled out on a massive scale and warn that manufacturers , retailers and logistics firms failing to adapt could suffer badly .
so is this for real , or will rfid turn out to be yet another investment black hole without real returns ?
the power of rfid " think hard which data rfid could give you and how you can use them ; without a good business plan the massive investment required by rfid will be pointless " rfid tags are really just souped-up barcodes that can talk .
the tag contains a tiny chip - the size of a full stop on your computer screen - and an antenna to broadcast a unique identifier number .
it is then attached to or woven into an asset , for example a pack of batteries , a crate of widgets or a keg of beer .
the result : " it 's like having an expert with a clipboard sitting next to every of your trucks , manufacturing lines , pallets with goods , and they can tell you at any time what is happening where , " says ken douglas , global director of technology at oil giant bp .
the limits for the technology 's application are set by your imagination - and the depth of your pockets .
bp uses rfid technology to stop theft at filling stations of a south african logistics company .
fuel pumps work only when a truck with the right tag pulls up close .
thieves ca n't get a drop .
marks and spencers is already using an early version of rfid technology to manage effectively its food supply chain .
in germany , retail giant metro - together with procter & gamble and enterprise software firm sap - has set up a " future store " , complete with smart shelves and trolleys tracking individual products , and a sophisticated stock control system .
if a shelf is close to running out of a certain product , it alerts the stock room to get fresh supplies , to name just one application .
the drawbacks of rfid ultimately , though , these are all trials .
for starters tags are still relatively expensive .
then there are technical limitations .
so-called " passive " tags are small , cheap and fit nicely on things like razor blades , europe 's most-stolen consumer product , but their broadcast range is just a few metres and requires many expensive rfid readers .
" active tags " have a battery and work well in the open , but are bulky and costly .
liquids and metals hinder radio waves .
add crushed tags and faulty readers , and your rfid-based stock flow system throws a wobbly .
reaping which benefits ?
and do you really need to invest in lots of technology to know exactly which sports shoe sits on which shelf ?
how much do you want to track ?
food multinational nestle " produces nine billion products every day and we ca n't tag them all , " says the firm 's technology manager paul roberts .
how do you crunch the data broadcast by millions of containers and billions of products , and how do you synchronise multiple massive data bases ?
who reaps the benefits , and who bears the costs ?
the tescos and wal-marts of this world ?
the manufacturers ?
the logistics companies ?
nobody is sure , and many executives pondering their rfid strategies sound somewhat scared , being aware both of the costs and potential benefits .
" at the moment very few people have a good business case for rfid , because they do n't know the costs involved , how the technology will develop and the extent of process engineering needed , " says john davison , head of retail research at consulting firm gartner .
if rfid generates only massive costs but does n't add value , it will disappear , says martin swerdlow , chief executive of consulting firm ipi - even though he believes in the ultimate success of the technology .
but uk retailers lose £ 1m worth of roll cages every year , says paul richardson of logistics company exel , which conducts trials with selfridges and house of fraser .
rfid could stop such and other losses .
and on high-value items radio tags can create real benefits , says stuart facey of trenstar , which manages most of the uk 's beer kegs and uses rfid to keep track of them .
" you are not going to solve your problems if you do n't know how the information you get is going to help you , " says bp 's ken douglas , who recommends that companies should start with small projects in closed supply chains with clearly defined objectives .
rfid is coming worryingly , rfid also has the potential to turn into the retail industry 's brent spar or frankenfood debacle .
privacy campaigners in the us warn that companies could abuse information gleaned about shopping habits of individual consumers , while others worry about the health implications of all those extra radio transmitters .
despite the hype and worries , rfid is very much in its infancy .
after the snazzy powerpoint presentations of some rfid cheerleaders , it comes as a harsh shock to realise that many trials currently conducted in the uk are extremely basic - even though the country is considered to be an rfid technology leader .
it took old-style barcodes 25 years to be standardised .
the rfid roll-out will be much faster , with wide agreement on a near-universal standard .
" diktats like that of wal-mart are -lsb- also -rsb- a powerful catalyst for people to look at the business value of rfid applications , " says keith bell of sap .
and most companies have desperately little visibility of what is happening in their supply chain .
therefore the lure of potential rfid benefits will be so strong that the use of rfid on palettes and crates is nearly inevitable .
when that happens it will hit suppliers , cargo carriers and retailers regardless of size .
the holy grail , though , will be the roll-out of radio tags to individual consumer products .
gartner 's john davison calls it " the endgame where the real benefits are to be had " .

so-called " passive " tags are small , cheap and fit nicely on things like razor blades , europe 's most-stolen consumer product , but their broadcast range is just a few metres and requires many expensive rfid readers .
" active tags " have a battery and work well in the open , but are bulky and costly .
liquids and metals hinder radio waves .
add crushed tags and faulty readers , and your rfid-based stock flow system throws a wobbly .
reaping which benefits ?
and do you really need to invest in lots of technology to know exactly which sports shoe sits on which shelf ?
smart shelves can cut down on theft and supply chain costs how much do you want to track ?
food multinational nestle " produces nine billion products every day and we ca n't tag them all , " says the firm 's technology manager paul roberts .
how do you crunch the data broadcast by millions of containers and billions of products , and how do you synchronise multiple massive data bases ?
who reaps the benefits , and who bears the costs ?
the tescos and wal-marts of this world ?
the manufacturers ?
the logistics companies ?
nobody is sure , and many executives pondering their rfid strategies sound somewhat scared , being aware both of the costs and potential benefits .
" at the moment very few people have a good business case for rfid , because they do n't know the costs involved , how the technology will develop and the extent of process engineering needed , " says john davison , head of retail research at consulting firm gartner .
if rfid generates only massive costs but does n't add value , it will disappear , says martin swerdlow , chief executive of consulting firm ipi - even though he believes in the ultimate success of the technology .
but uk retailers lose £ 1m worth of roll cages every year , says paul richardson of logistics company exel , which conducts trials with selfridges and house of fraser .
rfid could stop such and other losses .
and on high-value items radio tags can create real benefits , says stuart facey of trenstar , which manages most of the uk 's beer kegs and uses rfid to keep track of them .
" you are not going to solve your problems if you do n't know how the information you get is going to help you , " says bp 's ken douglas , who recommends that companies should start with small projects in closed supply chains with clearly defined objectives .
rfid is coming worryingly , rfid also has the potential to turn into the retail industry 's brent spar or frankenfood debacle .
privacy campaigners in the us warn that companies could abuse information gleaned about shopping habits of individual consumers , while others worry about the health implications of all those extra radio transmitters .
uk companies are testing whether rfid will work for them despite the hype and worries , rfid is very much in its infancy .
after the snazzy powerpoint presentations of some rfid cheerleaders , it comes as a harsh shock to realise that many trials currently conducted in the uk are extremely basic - even though the country is considered to be an rfid technology leader .
it took old-style barcodes 25 years to be standardised .
the rfid roll-out will be much faster , with wide agreement on a near-universal standard .
" diktats like that of wal-mart are -lsb- also -rsb- a powerful catalyst for people to look at the business value of rfid applications , " says keith bell of sap .
and most companies have desperately little visibility of what is happening in their supply chain .
therefore the lure of potential rfid benefits will be so strong that the use of rfid on palettes and crates is nearly inevitable .
when that happens it will hit suppliers , cargo carriers and retailers regardless of size .
the holy grail , though , will be the roll-out of radio tags to individual consumer products .
gartner 's john davison calls it " the endgame where the real benefits are to be had " .

three years ago bernard decided he wanted to play a bigger role in the tourism industry : afterall , tourism is big game in south africa .
mr marobe set up mankwi safari at the pilanesburg national park and in so doing became south africa 's first black safari operator .
" i knew deep down into my heart that this was going to be a real success , " he says .

in a matter of weeks , gas will start flowing from songosongo , east africa 's largest natural gas field .
this will make tanzania reliably selfsufficient in power .
and eventually it could make the country a power house for the region .
rain dependency the gas will fire jet turbines which will provide a quarter of tanzania 's electricity needs for at least the next 20 years .
mr kunert : when rainfall is low , the country runs out of electricity the project , which has been largely funded with world bank loans , has taken 20 years to get off the ground .
but after a period of intensive construction on the island of songosongo , the building of a 250 km pipeline , and the refurbishment of a dar es salaam power station , the generation of electricity is set to begin .
paul kunert , the managing director of songas , the company behind the project said it is an important step for tanzania .
" the gas provides a new fuel source .
" at the moment tanzania 's power system is dependent on hydro-electric generation to a very large extent , so when rainfall is low , like this year , the country runs out of electricity . "
cheaper and cleaner this power deficit has forced tanzania to import oil to generate electricity , costing the country a budget-breaking us $ 13m a month .
mr rutabanzibwa : gas will create a basis for economic growth patrick rutabanzibwa , the permanent secretary in the country 's energy ministry , believes finding a reliable energy source like gas will boost tanzania 's economic development .
" economic growth and the demand for power have a linear relationship , so the gas will give us the basis for predictable sustainable economic growth , " he said .
the gas is to be used mainly to generate electricity , but it will also be supplied directly to a number of major companies which are planning to use it to power some or all of their production processes .
tanzania breweries will be using gas to fire its boilers .
according to general manager , trevor gray it has distinct advantages over oil .
" there are economic benefits , " he said .
" it is cheaper than heavy furnace oil that we are using at the moment .
it is also cleaner and more efficient .
" it is an important move for us and i expect other industries to follow suit . "
no access the search for further deposits is continuing off the island of songosongo .
tanzania breweries will be using gas to fire its boilers if more gas is found , then tanzania could become a regional broker for power exports to other east african countries , as well as into the power pool of southern africa .
but while the government looks towards a brighter future , the average tanzanian is unlikely to benefit for some time to come .
only around 7 % of all tanzanians have electricity , either because it costs too much or because the infrastructure is not in place .
those people who are not connected hope that an improvement in tanzania 's economy will eventually translate into access to electricity .

the portsmouth university study results will be announced at an awards ceremony for police civilian support officers -lrb- pcsos -rrb- on wednesday .
but another survey in yorkshire and humberside found people were confused by the roles of extra police services .
pcsos , introduced two years ago , have limited powers and can detain a suspect for 30 minutes , but not arrest them .
they have been called " extra eyes and ears " for the police by metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens .
survey findings 50 % of westminster people and 70 % in camden said pcsos reassured them over safety more than half in westminster and almost 75 % in camden said they helped reduce their fear of crime but some rank-and-file officers opposed their introduction claiming it was " policing on the cheap " .
they argued the support officers ' salaries , which are less than a police officer 's , should be spent on mainstream recruitment .
the metropolitan police deputy commissioner sir ian blair will announced the results of the survey at the first pcso achievement awards .
twelve support officers have been nominated for " outstanding contribution to their local communities " .
the survey also found they provided an important link between the police and the community .
sir ian said : " the extra uniformed presence on our streets was intended to reassure the public and it is heartening to see that they are having exactly that effect . "

they have been called " extra eyes and ears " for the police by metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens .
survey findings 50 % of westminster people and 70 % in camden said pcsos reassured them over safety more than half in westminster and almost 75 % in camden said they helped reduce their fear of crime private ' police ' confuse public but some rank-and-file officers opposed their introduction claiming it was " policing on the cheap " .
