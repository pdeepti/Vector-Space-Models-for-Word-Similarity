shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .

the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .

his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.04.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .
survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.04.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .
survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .
so far seven eu members have indicated they will hold a referendum on the treaty : the czech republic , luxembourg , denmark , ireland , the netherlands , portugal and spain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders want constitution deal by june acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.04.2004 blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a referendum it is .
in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .
so far seven eu members have indicated they will hold a referendum on the treaty : the czech republic , luxembourg , denmark , ireland , the netherlands , portugal and spain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders want constitution deal by june acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees . " rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr.

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .
so far seven eu members have indicated they will hold a referendum on the treaty : the czech republic , luxembourg , denmark , ireland , the netherlands , portugal and spain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders want constitution deal by june acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .

he succeeds andre dose , who resigned last month following speculation that he could face legal action over a 2001 crossair crash that killed 24 people .
crossair was a subsidiary of swissair .
franz was with deutsche bahn for the past nine years , most recently as a member of executive management in charge of passenger sales .
but he was forced to leave the company after intense criticism of his reforms to db 's price system .
the unpopular changes resulted in heavy losses and customer complaints .
swiss 's board of directors were perhaps more impressed by franz 's role in the early 1990s with german national carrier lufthansa , where he was part of the team that engineered the airline 's financial turnaround after the gulf war .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

" it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.04.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc spd , greens want more expensive air travel germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens want to put a damper on the burgeoning market for cheap flights in europe .
members of both parties proposed upping taxes on airplane fuel and tickets for international flights in order to create an equal playing field for plane and train travel companies .
currently , value added tax is charged on train tickets , but not on plane tickets .
and unlike fuel for cars , airplane fuel is not subjected to a mineral oil tax .
in a joint proposal , the spd and greens have appealed to the government to do away with these differences , while at the same time requesting a reduction in value added tax on long distance train tickets to make train travel cheaper .
the issue is likely to come before parliament this autumn , though a spokesperson from the german finance ministry told daily berliner zeitung that the government currently has no intention of making air travel more expensive . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- more pessimism about german economic recovery 20.04.2004 -pipe- puma chases record profits 20.04.2004 -pipe- swiss names new ceo 19.04.2004 -pipe- germany 's iw institute cuts growth forecast 19.04.2004 -pipe- conflicting economic views at hanover fair 19.04.2004 -pipe- welteke wo n't keep full salary 16.04.2004 -pipe- deutsche post signs deal to deliver british mail 16.04.2004 -pipe- think tank predicts eu expansion will help german economy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 20.04.2004 architect sheds father 's legacy in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successful primarily outside of germany : albert speer , jr .
shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees . " rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr.

the zew 's indicator of economic sentiment for germany now stands at 49.7 points compared to 57.6 points in march .
the research institute said one reason for the downward trend is the most recent economic data from germany , such as industrial production or incoming order figures .
the weak job market recovery this spring and rising oil prices also contributed to the pessimistic outlook .
" optimism among the financial experts is giving way to realism , " said zew president wolfgang franz .
over 300 analysts and institutional investors participated in the zew survey , which is conducted on a monthly basis . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- puma chases record profits 20.04.2004 -pipe- swiss names new ceo 19.04.2004 -pipe- germany 's iw institute cuts growth forecast 19.04.2004 -pipe- conflicting economic views at hanover fair 19.04.2004 -pipe- welteke wo n't keep full salary 16.04.2004 -pipe- deutsche post signs deal to deliver british mail 16.04.2004 -pipe- think tank predicts eu expansion will help german economy 16.04.2004 -pipe- licorice addict sues german confectioner radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .

the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .

his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees . " rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr. 's " germania " vision for berlin . in china , speer jr. stresses , his expertise is all that matters .
no one here ever asks him about his father . and if they did , he would n't likely have much to say . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new i.m. pei building opens in berlin it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.04.2004 blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a referendum it is .
in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .
so far seven eu members have indicated they will hold a referendum on the treaty : the czech republic , luxembourg , denmark , ireland , the netherlands , portugal and spain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders want constitution deal by june acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

" it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.04.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .
survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .

the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .

his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees . " rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr. 's " germania " vision for berlin . in china , speer jr. stresses , his expertise is all that matters .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .

survivors of one of italy 's worst wartime massacres and relatives of the victims have been called to give evidence , but the defendants are all being tried in absentia . all in their eighties , the suspects are also under investigation in germany , where they live , and are unlikely to be extradited to italy to participate in the trial .
the court will be deciding whether to indict four more suspects on the same charges , and the trial may be suspended for several more weeks so that all seven suspects can be tried together .
the massacre occurred days after british troops liberated florence in 1944 , when hundreds of ss troops surrounded the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema .
according to witnesses , they rounded up the villagers and shot them .
others were forced into cellars and other enclosed spaces and systematically killed with hand grenades .
prosecutors believe the ss were seeking to stop partisans in the village , which had been flooded with refugees , but most of those killed were women , children and the elderly . more briefs 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 19.04.2004 -pipe- ioc president likes leipzig 's olympic bid 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .

" rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr.

shanghai is often described as the biggest building site in the world .
architect albert speer , jr . , has risen to the challenge , and he 's put an uncomfortable family connection behind him on the way . the last decade has seen over 2 million people relocate to shanghai as more and more ambitious building projects are realized .
innovations include some 5,000 gleaming new highrises , over 1,000 new streets , three subway lines , a new airport and an entire inner city highway infrastructure , complete with three mammoth bridges over the huangpu river . german planners and architects are among the many international experts flocking to shanghai to help shape the future of the world 's fastest-growing city with diverse urban development initiatives . the frankfurt-based architectural team as & p has had an office in china since 1999 .
in 2001 , it won an international competition for the design of the shanghai international automobile city , and it has been scooping up regular urban planning contracts ever since .
in shanghai 's current climate of architectural experimentation , as & p practices ecologically friendly , sustainable urban development , and these days , it 's an established name in china .
the speer legacy but what really sets as & p apart is its historical baggage .
now one of germany 's most successful architecture practices , it 's headed by albert speer jr . , who has the unfortunate historical stigma of having been born the son of hitler 's favorite architect .
albert speer sr. died in 1981 , having been sentenced at the nuremberg trials to 20 years in berlin 's spandau prison .
he was released in 1966 , but father and son were never close .
in interviews , speer jr . , is reluctant to talk about his father 's legacy , but there have at times been parallels in the scale of the two mens ' work . for like his father , speer jr. is an architectural success story .
as & p scooped the coveted commission to build a new soccer stadium in munich for the 2006 world cup in germany .
berlin 's olympic stadium , scene of the 1936 olympics and memorably showcased in the infamous leni riefenstahl film olympia , was built by albert speer sr. it 's just one example of speer jr. following in his father 's footsteps .
the architect also won the contract to prepare the eastern german city of leipzig 's bid for the 2012 olympics - while back in the 1930s , his father began revamping berlin as the capital of the nazi 's supra-german state by building the olympic stadium . a different agenda in fact , speer 's work could n't be more different to that of his father .
his architectural vision , laid out in his 1992 book the intelligent city , is of a socially progressive , humane metropolis . in an interview with the architecture magazine metropolis in 2002 , he described his work in china as " knowledge transfer " on sustainable development . " we 're trying to network planning , infrastructure , and utilities - to save energy and resources , and preserve the environment , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that in five years they will be able to do it all without us - they are good learners .
my task is to help them along the way . " " german town " one of as & p 's chinese projects is the so-called " german town . " seven satellite towns are currently being built outside shanghai based on european models .
" german town " will be situated in anting town , jiading district , home to an international automotive center .
the project entails the construction of various german-style buildings , and speer jr. is more aware than most that it 's a concept steeped in perjorative associations . " obviously , we wo n't be trying to recreate rothenburg ob der tauber , " he pointed out in an interview with public broadcaster mdr .
" we want to build a small , modern town with , for example , tiled roofes .
visually , the streets will be different to what the chinese are used to , they 'll be slighted curved and lined with trees . " rather than germany 's traditional half-timbered style , he says , the town " will have the same sort of atmosphere as a modern residential estate . " another plan involves a vast north-south axis running from beijing 's olympic village to the city 's forbidden city and finishing at the new train station which links beijing with the rest of china . predictably , it 's a project that many back in germany have already compared to speer sr. 's " germania " vision for berlin . in china , speer jr. stresses , his expertise is all that matters .

in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives . speaking in the house of commons on tuesday , blair confirmed his government would call for a referendum on the european union 's constitution , but indicated it would only take place after the general elections that must be called by mid-2006 . " let the people have the final say , " blair told parliament in london . " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the center and heart of european decision-making or not ; time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally of europe , or on its margins , " blair said .
he added that eu enlargement in may will create "the strongest political union and greatest economic market in the world .
britain should be at the heart of it - that is its right and its destiny . " a u-turn on policy the move which has been dubbed blair 's most significant u-turn on policy since he came to power in 1997 , would be the first national referendum in the uk in 30 years .
last october the prime minister insisted that britain would not hold a referendum on the proposed european constitution , which needs the ratification of all 25 member states to come into force . blair 's change of stance is believed to be prompted by the largely euroskeptic opposition conservatives , who have argued that the constitution would undermine britain 's sovereignty - a stance that has found support in large sections of the media . the conservatives say a constitution would erode the country 's powers over criminal justice , tax and foreign policy and is making the referendum a central plank of their campaign for european elections on june 10 . on tuesday blair said he would use a referendum campaign to challenge eu myths floated by his conservative opponents and a euroskeptic press .
" let the eurosceptics whose true agenda we will expose , make their case .
let those of us who believe in britain in europe ... make ours , " he said . eu constitution closer to deal since plans to draw up the ambitious eu constitution were first published in brussels in may last year , britain has consistently objected to any rules that would veto its national laws on tax , social security and importantly on foreign policy and defense issues . however last month the prime minister pledged to reach agreement on the constitution suggesting that britain could be flexible on the proposed majority voting system on less controversial areas to ensure quicker agreement . eu leaders hope to agree on a deal this june following recent reconciliatory overtures by spain and poland indicating they might be willing to compromise on the controversial issue of voting rights in the constitution . the constitution , which is aimed at streamlining the decision making process of the bloc when it expands to include ten new members this may , will create the position of an eu president and foreign minister and sets out plans for closer defense cooperation between eu member states . mixed reaction blair 's decision to call a vote on the eu constitution is expected to be largely welcomed at home , with british public opinion on the eu the most skeptical in europe . conservative leader michael howard welcomed tuesday 's announcement , saying blair had " at long last seen sense on this issue , " but ridiculed the prime minister for saying last year that he had " no reverse gear " and added , " today you could hear the gears grinding . " but elsewhere in europe , reaction to blair 's move was mixed . john bruton , the former irish prime minister and member of the european convention that drafted the treaty , told the financial times , blair was showing " no leadership on european issues .
this is an example of him wanting to hand this problem over to the public , rather than take responsibility himself . " german chancellor gerhard schröder played down fears that blair 's move could derail the eu treaty and told reporters britain 's decision was its sovereign right .
" my friend tony blair knows precisely why he has done that and will certainly ensure that it is conducted successfully for the benefit of europe , but it is a sovereign decision that i am not going to comment on , " schröder said . politically risky move the move is also considered to a politically risky gamble for blair , whose personal ratings have plummeted since the iraq war and who may seek a third term in power as early as next may . a yougov survey showed on monday that 53 percent of uk voters would reject the eu constitution in a referendum .
the poll of 2,462 people questioned online last week showed 16 percent would vote "yes " and 28 percent were undecided .
so far seven eu members have indicated they will hold a referendum on the treaty : the czech republic , luxembourg , denmark , ireland , the netherlands , portugal and spain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders want constitution deal by june acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .

a report by its public services committee blames the switching of benefits and pension payments direct to bank accounts for hastening closures .
these changes could threaten up to 500 of the city 's post offices , suggests the report .
a government report said too many post offices were competing for too little business .
in november 2000 , the post office started the urban reinvention programme , which sought to restructure the company by closing a third of its 9,000 urban branches and modernising some of the remaining ones .
but the assembly 's report says : " the closure of a high street post office is not a decision that should be taken lightly as this is one of the stepping-stones that can lead to the decline of the high street . "
the report also suggests the possibility of allowing post offices to sell travelcards and receive congestion charge payments as a way of boosting business .

as well as providing viewers with images in colour , it also gave them the luxury of a third channel , having had bbc one since 1936 and itv since 1955 .
but bbc two was launched less in a blaze of glory than a dark disaster - a power cut wiped power from television centre , forcing the opening night schedule to be aborted .
and because the new channel was broadcast using the latest technology it was available only to viewers who purchased a new television set able to receive it .
bbc two allowed us time which meant we could take risks , develop them and run with it tim brooke-taylor -lrb- pictured right with the goodies -rrb- this led to accusations it was a channel for the well-off because lower classes could not afford to buy another tv .
bbc two took time to find its feet - and viewers - with schedules overhauled regularly to try and find a winning formula .
part of its evolution included revolutionary colour broadcasts , beginning with wimbledon coverage in 1967 , although they were not available everyone .
it beat bbc one and itv to broadcasting in colour by two years .
the forsyte saga was not only popular but has been recognised as extremely good television susan hampshire the channel also had a very famous face as its controller between 1965 and 1968 - sir david attenborough .
it was during his era that seminal programmes such as man alive premiered , but probably the biggest tv event screened during this period was mini-series the forstyte saga , which became one of the first-must see costumes dramas .
it went on to win a bafta and an emmy for actress susan hampshire .
hampshire told bbc news online : " i was very lucky to have such a wonderful part in a series that was not only popular but that has been recognised as extremely good television . "
bbc two has also gained a reputation for creating ground-breaking comedies from the satirical not the nine o 'clock news in the 1970s , to the young ones in the 1980s .
it also saw the debut of the goodies in a late night slot .
goodie tim brooke-taylor told bbc news online : " we had a very good relationship with all the bbc two controllers .
they knew we were slightly left of centre and that was what bbc two was all about .
they took a chance on us .
" bbc two allowed us time which meant we could take risks , develop them and run with it . "
but brooke-taylor acknowledged one of the best decisions made was to move the goodies to an earlier slot on bbc one , although he was against it at the time .
years ago it was a dusty old channel doing things like foreign war documentaries and i never watched it lowri turner golden globe-winning comedy the office started life on bbc two , carving out a dedicated audience .
despite resistance from creator ricky gervais , who called bbc two the " spiritual home " of the office , the show was moved to bbc one for its bafta-winning final episodes last christmas .
bbc two 's evolution is continuing with the expansion of the digital market .
the launch of channels including bbc three and four means it is now sharing the limelight as a testing ground for new shows .
bafta-winning cult comedy little britain , created by matt lucas and david walliams , started life on bbc three .
word of mouth praise , and cult status saw the show 's digital audience rise prompting the entire series to get a run on bbc two .
john hurt criticised spending on dramas bbc four has also arguably taken some of the limelight because its remit was to show high-brow cultural tv , something bbc two had been traditionally seen to encompass .
actor john hurt vented his wrath on the subject following the filming of drama the alan clark diaries , which was produced for bbc four .
he hit out at tight budgets and said the drama was one that would have traditionally been shown on two , but had been sidelined to four .
" what did bbc two first do ?
did n't it provide us with something a little bit more interesting than we thought we were ready for ?
is n't that what it was there for ? " said hurt .
however broadcaster lowri turner , who worked on would like to meet and looking good , praised progress made by the channel .
further challenges " bbc two , first under mark thompson and then jane root , became very brave in its commissions , " she told bbc news online .
" years ago it was a dusty old channel doing things like foreign war documentaries and i never watched it .
" then they suddenly realised it could be popular and do lifestyle shows in a way that was different from those on bbc one or itv . "
bbc two is still considered highly in the competitive world of tv , winning terrestrial channel of the year at the edinburgh television festival in 2003 .
but the channel faces further challenges as it enters it 41st year .
one change will be the loss of the simpsons , which will soon move to channel 4 , a show which appealed to the younger demographic .
and with the imminent departure of controller jane root the future of bbc two is uncertain - whoever takes over will surely want to put their own stamp on the 40-year-old channel .
happy birthday bbc two is being screened on the channel on tuesday evening at 2000 bst , featuring people who have worked both behind and in front of its cameras over the years .

further challenges " bbc two , first under mark thompson and then jane root , became very brave in its commissions , " she told bbc news online .

bbc two is still considered highly in the competitive world of tv , winning terrestrial channel of the year at the edinburgh television festival in 2003 .
but the channel faces further challenges as it enters it 41st year .
one change will be the loss of the simpsons , which will soon move to channel 4 , a show which appealed to the younger demographic .
and with the imminent departure of controller jane root the future of bbc two is uncertain - whoever takes over will surely want to put their own stamp on the 40-year-old channel .

but brooke-taylor acknowledged one of the best decisions made was to move the goodies to an earlier slot on bbc one , although he was against it at the time .
years ago it was a dusty old channel doing things like foreign war documentaries and i never watched it lowri turner golden globe-winning comedy the office started life on bbc two , carving out a dedicated audience .
despite resistance from creator ricky gervais , who called bbc two the " spiritual home " of the office , the show was moved to bbc one for its bafta-winning final episodes last christmas .
bbc two 's evolution is continuing with the expansion of the digital market .
the launch of channels including bbc three and four means it is now sharing the limelight as a testing ground for new shows .
bafta-winning cult comedy little britain , created by matt lucas and david walliams , started life on bbc three .
word of mouth praise , and cult status saw the show 's digital audience rise prompting the entire series to get a run on bbc two .
john hurt criticised spending on dramas bbc four has also arguably taken some of the limelight because its remit was to show high-brow cultural tv , something bbc two had been traditionally seen to encompass .
actor john hurt vented his wrath on the subject following the filming of drama the alan clark diaries , which was produced for bbc four .
he hit out at tight budgets and said the drama was one that would have traditionally been shown on two , but had been sidelined to four .
" what did bbc two first do ?
did n't it provide us with something a little bit more interesting than we thought we were ready for ?
is n't that what it was there for ? " said hurt .
however broadcaster lowri turner , who worked on would like to meet and looking good , praised progress made by the channel .
further challenges " bbc two , first under mark thompson and then jane root , became very brave in its commissions , " she told bbc news online .
" years ago it was a dusty old channel doing things like foreign war documentaries and i never watched it .
" then they suddenly realised it could be popular and do lifestyle shows in a way that was different from those on bbc one or itv . "
bbc two is still considered highly in the competitive world of tv , winning terrestrial channel of the year at the edinburgh television festival in 2003 .
but the channel faces further challenges as it enters it 41st year .
one change will be the loss of the simpsons , which will soon move to channel 4 , a show which appealed to the younger demographic .
and with the imminent departure of controller jane root the future of bbc two is uncertain - whoever takes over will surely want to put their own stamp on the 40-year-old channel .
happy birthday bbc two is being screened on the channel on tuesday evening at 2000 bst , featuring people who have worked both behind and in front of its cameras over the years .

but as last-minute rehearsals were drawing to an end , a fire at battersea power station plunged television centre into chaos .
a blackout across most of west london meant bbc television 's glittering launch of their new channel was anything but .
instead of presenter denis tuohy introducing cole porter 's kiss me kate , the channel hastily launched into a short news bulletin from alexandra palace .
bbc two 's first night did not go as planned but the bulletin , read by the late gerald priestland , was itself dogged by problems with the whole report broadcast without sound for the first two-and-a-half minutes .
the rest of the launch evening consisted of test cards reading " bbc will follow shortly " interspersed with characteristic bbc-style apologies .
tuohy , who was to be the first " face " on the new channel , said it was a nerve-wracking evening all round .
" the sense of occasion really had us fired up and i was feeling very nervous , " he told bbc news online .

" when i went back down to the gallery with about half an hour to go , i noticed all the television screens were blank and there were a lot of people shouting something about battersea . "
robert longman , who was in charge of engineering that night , recalls trying to negotiate the confusing corridors of television centre with a candle stuck in a paper cup as they desperately tried to find a way to get the new channel on air .
" it got to about 6.30pm when i noticed that the power frequency was falling slightly ... then we lost power completely , " he told bbc news online .
" i went around telling everyone that we would be able to sort it out and not to panic ... then we found out the whole of west london had gone . "
" i just froze and thought ' oh dear ' , because it was an engineering problem - my problem - and the place was packed with people .
the candle in the darkened studio became an iconic image " in the end we just sent everyone up to the bbc club for a drink where there was emergency lighting . "
mr longman said they tried to find emergency feeds to get on them on air for the 1920 bst launch , but had to finally admit defeat at midnight .
he added : " michael peacock -lrb- bbc two controller -rrb- was quite pleased about it because , although bbc two was known , it was n't terribly well-known and all the following day 's papers had headlines ' bbc two fails - corporation to try again tonight ' .
" it was wonderful publicity and made sure people tuned in . "
as a result of the disastrous launch , bbc two 's first scheduled programme to go ahead was playschool at 1100 bst the following day .
viewers who tuned in to watch the opening night were disappointed later that evening , a young tuohy appeared on screen blowing out a candle in a darkened studio and apologising for the previous night 's problems before the opening night 's planned schedule was eventually run .
tuohy said : " we knew we had to make some reference to the blackout so there i was , with my mod haircut , in the studio blowing out a candle .
" that image is run again and again every time there is a reference to the bbc two launch , but it was so long ago that most people these days do n't have a clue what its all about . "
no recording of priestland 's original news bulletin was thought to have been made - that is until february 2003 when a tape was found in a dusty corner of a cupboard in kingswood warren , in surrey .
engineers james insell and stephen anderson were looking in the modest archive collection when they came across the two inch quad spool tape marked " opening of bbc " dated 20 april 1964 .
the original 1964 recording was rediscovered last year mr insell said it was an " astonishing " moment when he realised what it might be and arranged to have the tape transferred to a modern digital format on one of the bbc 's only surviving quad vtrs .
he told bbc news online : " we put it on and at first there were a lot of test signals , which was a good sign , and we kept our fingers crossed .
" it was a very exciting moment when gerald priestland eventually popped up on the screen . "
the recording was made by alan bellis - an engineer working at kingswood warren on the fateful night a recording of the first night was found last year he said the power cut in london had caused some knock-on problems , leading to low frequency and voltage .
" i was running around like someone demented with a screwdriver to get in going and i was so pleased when i managed to record a little bit of it .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- profile : tesco chief sir terry leahy home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 20 april , 2004 , 07:17 gmt 08:17 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version profile : tesco chief sir terry leahy by jorn madslien bbc news online business reporter sir terry 's meteoric rise has earned him much respect it is quite a paradox that perhaps the most respected business leader in the land has found himself under fire - not from competitors , consumers or the authorities , but from the owners of the company he runs .
early this month , tesco 's chief executive sir terry leahy was forced to bow to shareholder pressure and accept that his two year service contract was cut to one year rolling contracts .
the move followed last year 's annual general meeting where 40 % of shareholders voted against or positively abstained from the vote on the length of sir terry 's notice period .
shortening notice periods is seen as a crucial step towards making it easier for shareholders to sack failed executives without having to kit them out with golden parachutes .
but in the case of sir terry , such shareholder activism can easily be seen as ungrateful given his skills at making money on behalf of investors .
certainly , sir terry - who is seen as a tough and blunt operator - seemed to think so .
at the time he appeared reluctant to accept changes to his arrangement and stressed the importance of honouring contracts .
strong performance sir terry joined tesco straight after graduating from the university of manchester institute of science and technology -lrb- umist -rrb- in 1979 .
tesco 's share price has risen steadily during the past year he entered the supermarket chain as a marketing executive , was appointed to tesco 's board of directors in 1992 , and by the time he was 40 he had worked his way up to become chief executive in 1997 .
under the stewardship of the now 48-year-old supermarket boss , tesco has built its share of the uk market to 24 % , and at least one in every eight pounds spent with a uk retailer now ends up in sir terry 's coffers .
in addition , the retailer has expanded dramatically in new markets , both geographically and in terms of products and segments .
tesco 's international expansion has given it a presence in 11 markets in ireland , eastern europe and asia .
while in the uk , an acquisition spree into the convenience stores market - where it recently snapped up adminstore , owner of europa , harts and cullens - has given it a strong urban foothold in london .
the stores are due to be re-branded tesco express .
new markets have also been reached through ventures such as its recent push into dvd rentals , and tesco 's website is filled with a variety of offers ranging from cheaper home telephony and insurance or finance deals , to holiday and flight offers .

early this month , tesco 's chief executive sir terry leahy was forced to bow to shareholder pressure and accept that his two year service contract was cut to one year rolling contracts .
the move followed last year 's annual general meeting where 40 % of shareholders voted against or positively abstained from the vote on the length of sir terry 's notice period .
shortening notice periods is seen as a crucial step towards making it easier for shareholders to sack failed executives without having to kit them out with golden parachutes .
but in the case of sir terry , such shareholder activism can easily be seen as ungrateful given his skills at making money on behalf of investors .
certainly , sir terry - who is seen as a tough and blunt operator - seemed to think so .
at the time he appeared reluctant to accept changes to his arrangement and stressed the importance of honouring contracts .
strong performance sir terry joined tesco straight after graduating from the university of manchester institute of science and technology -lrb- umist -rrb- in 1979 .
tesco 's share price has risen steadily during the past year he entered the supermarket chain as a marketing executive , was appointed to tesco 's board of directors in 1992 , and by the time he was 40 he had worked his way up to become chief executive in 1997 .
under the stewardship of the now 48-year-old supermarket boss , tesco has built its share of the uk market to 24 % , and at least one in every eight pounds spent with a uk retailer now ends up in sir terry 's coffers .
in addition , the retailer has expanded dramatically in new markets , both geographically and in terms of products and segments .
tesco 's international expansion has given it a presence in 11 markets in ireland , eastern europe and asia .
while in the uk , an acquisition spree into the convenience stores market - where it recently snapped up adminstore , owner of europa , harts and cullens - has given it a strong urban foothold in london .
the stores are due to be re-branded tesco express .
new markets have also been reached through ventures such as its recent push into dvd rentals , and tesco 's website is filled with a variety of offers ranging from cheaper home telephony and insurance or finance deals , to holiday and flight offers .

professor gunther von hagens ' live autopsy caused a furore my foetus follows a long tradition of broadcasters pushing the boundaries of taste and decency - and inevitably sparking controversy .
the documentary has already upset some sections of the roman catholic church , which called it abhorrent , while tv scientist professor robert winston questioned whether it was " an absolutely valid tv exercise " .
he was subject to criticism of his human body series , which showed the moment of a man 's death .
much of the criticism came before the programme was shown - and it went on to win a number of baftas .
in a similar vein , channel 4 's screening of a live autopsy in november 2002 by professor gunther von hagens , the man behind the body worlds exhibitions , generated 130 complaints .
channel 4 defended the programme , which went out at 2345 gmt , saying the event was of " genuine public interest " .
despite the protests , the independent television commission -lrb- itc -rrb- dismissed the complaints .
body parts in its adjudication , it said : " although the subject matter and content of the programme approached the limits of what is allowed by the programme code , those limits were not exceeded . "
many controversial programmes have related to human body parts .
brass eye was one of the most controversial shows on uk tv there was a press storm in january 1999 when , on this morning , doctor chris steele conducted a testicular examination of volunteer alan reeves on camera to publicise the dangers of testicular cancer .
the itc rules at the time said genitalia should not be shown unless for " responsible medical reasons " .
richard and judy also provoked a storm when they featured couples experimenting with viagra - although no sex scenes were actually shown .
country tv chef hugh fearnley whittingstall caused an outcry when he devised a recipe for a family using the placenta of their newborn baby .
nine viewers complained , including a labour mp , and the broadcasting standards commission upheld them because it breached a taboo " which would have been disagreeable to many " .
channel 4 landed in the headlines again in 2002 with the now infamous episode of brass eye in which creator chris morris spoofed a documentary about paedophilia .
it attracted 1,500 complaints , including the nspcc , and the itc made the rare decision to force channel 4 to apologise .
sweeping changes the bulk of complaints were about brass eye 's apparent mocking of a serious and sensitive subject and too little warning given about the nature of the programme .
despite the furore , brass eye went on to be nominated for a bafta .
magician derren brown 's russian roulette stunt - in which he claimed to fire a gun at his head - also caused the channel 4 hotline to ring with complaints over trivialising suicide and the promotion of gun culture .
janet jackson 's flash has seen changes to us tv broadcasts but complaints about his televised trick were not upheld as the broadcasting watchdog said it was an illusion and did not glamorise guns .
but no uk tv programme can compete with the furore caused by janet jackson 's " wardrobe malfunction " , which saw her nipple exposed during the live super bowl - sparking more than 200,000 complaints .
the backlash has led to sweeping changes to us live broadcasts , with time-delays now widely employed and a rise in potential fines for networks that breach guidelines .

education minister jane davidson announced the plans on monday .
the " earn as you learn " scheme will be means-tested but has been hailed as a way of reducing the uk 's post-16 drop out rate .
but conservative education spokesman david davies said it was a headline-grabbing gimmick .
in pilot projects carried out in a third of english leas , the attendance of 16-year-old boys rose by 6.9 percentage points while that of 16-year-old girls rose by 5.9 percentage points .
the institute for fiscal studies -lrb- ifs -rrb- and university of loughborough estimated the staying on rate had risen by 10 % in the most deprived areas .
mr davies told bbc wales : " it 's another example of headline-grabbing gimmick that tony blair has called for .
" we 're going to be paying teenagers peanuts to stay on for two years and then charge them thousands to go to university . "
education maintenance allowances will be available across the country as of september this year .
anyone who lives in a house where income is £ 30,000 or less will be eligible for the means-tested payments which will vary between £ 10 and £ 30 a week .
there is a great problem of poverty in parts of wales and we have an opportunity to do something to the break the cycle of deprivation rhys williams , nut cymru bonuses of £ 100 could also be given out to students who stay with their courses and demonstrate advances in learning .
ms davidson 's announcement follows a similar one in england .
she said : " whilst we have introduced the assembly learning grant scheme in wales , which has clearly benefited those aged 18 plus , i do not underestimate the potential which emas have for encouraging 16 and 17 year olds to remain in education . "
the minister said that extra money to fund the project had been agreed with the treasury .
latest assembly government figures show that nearly 40 % of pupils stayed on at school after the age of 16 , compared to just over 35 % in 1990 .
rhys williams of the national union of teachers ' cymru welcomed the decision and said evidence from pilot schemes in england had shown it could make a difference .
he said : " there is a great problem of poverty in parts of wales and we have an opportunity to do something to break the cycle of deprivation . "
mr williams said poorer areas of wales had more pupils who left school without qualifications .
" it can be passed down from generation to generation , with grandparents and parents having a bad experience at school .
the allowances are set to start in september " anything that cuts across that in providing support for young people is wholly sensible . "
he said it could be argued that there should be more money offered , but it was " an improvement on zero " and he thought £ 30 a week would make a difference to young people in making decisions .
david eynon , headteacher at st cenydd school in caerphilly , which has 160 pupils in its sixth form , said it was also important that the quality and variety of courses on offer to students was there .
he said : " as a headteacher i 'm glad to see resources coming into education in every shape or form .
i 'm well aware the importance the assembly is placing on post-16 education , it 's important that research is done so we get the best possible value from the money coming in .
" it 's also important that the system of means testing and administration is relatively straightforward , so pupils do n't have their expectations built up and dashed . "

prime minister wen jiabao said makers of the products would be severely punished , the china daily paper said .
state officials have been sent to the city of fuyang , in anhui province , to investigate further .
correspondents say the case highlights the widespread problem of counterfeit foodstuffs and medicines in china .
according to official media reports , up to 200 babies who were fed formula milk of little nutritional value were affected .
local media said some of the babies developed what doctors called " big head disease " , where infants ' heads appear abnormally large in comparison to their bodies .
it was not clear of the counterfeit powder included any toxic ingredients , but some children were reported to have died within three days of being fed the fake milk .
others were hospitalised when their parents realised they were ill .
fuyang 's people 's hospital alone received more than 60 babies who had been fed fake milk formula , according to the beijing news .
" my girl , the first child of mine , died when she was only four months old , " said zhang linwei , from wangzhuang village in fuyang .
mr zhang told china central television that he only realised his daughter was ill when she refused to drink any more powder .
" before that , i thought my daughter 's face was becoming fatter and fatter because she was fed well and grew fast , " mr zhang said .
an analysis of one formula found it contained as little as one-sixth the required amount of protein and other nutrients needed for a baby 's proper development , reports said .
zhang fangjun , a medical expert at fuyang 's renmin hospital , told the china daily : " drinking such fake milk powder is no different from drinking water . "

prime minister wen jiabao said makers of the products would be severely punished , the china daily paper said .
state officials have been sent to the city of fuyang , in anhui province , to investigate further .
correspondents say the case highlights the widespread problem of counterfeit foodstuffs and medicines in china .
according to official media reports , up to 200 babies who were fed formula milk of little nutritional value were affected .
local media said some of the babies developed what doctors called " big head disease " , where infants ' heads appear abnormally large in comparison to their bodies .
it was not clear of the counterfeit powder included any toxic ingredients , but some children were reported to have died within three days of being fed the fake milk .
others were hospitalised when their parents realised they were ill .
fuyang 's people 's hospital alone received more than 60 babies who had been fed fake milk formula , according to the beijing news .
" my girl , the first child of mine , died when she was only four months old , " said zhang linwei , from wangzhuang village in fuyang .
mr zhang told china central television that he only realised his daughter was ill when she refused to drink any more powder .
" before that , i thought my daughter 's face was becoming fatter and fatter because she was fed well and grew fast , " mr zhang said .
an analysis of one formula found it contained as little as one-sixth the required amount of protein and other nutrients needed for a baby 's proper development , reports said .
zhang fangjun , a medical expert at fuyang 's renmin hospital , told the china daily : " drinking such fake milk powder is no different from drinking water . "

during the first three months of 2004 - before april 's boardroom coup led by rebel shareholders - revenues fell 5 % to 125m euros -lrb- £ 82m ; $ 149m -rrb- .
eurotunnel 's only positive news was truck traffic , which rose 7 % .
the company 's consistently below-par performance has been the main cause of discontent about the firm 's old board .
new managers have only a limited time to turn eurotunnel 's fortunes around .
missing targets investors also want state help , but the uk and french governments have so far refused .
french transport minister gilles de robien has so far shown little enthusiasm for dipping into the public purse , arguing that an anglo-french treaty forbids state subsidies .
but without help , the company needs a dramatic improvement in its trading to stabilise its finances .
eurotunnel never met the ambitious targets set when the project was financed in the late 1980s .
its debts are currently just over £ 6bn , and faces a credit crunch in 2006 when repayments on the debt coincide with the end of an agreeement which guarantees minimum revenues from rail operators .

new boss charlie bell started at the bottom flipping burgers in australia before becoming the country 's youngest manager at 19 the aim would not be to have more and more mcdonald 's covering every inch of the planet , but to ration them and make sure the ones that survived would be clean and attractive .
