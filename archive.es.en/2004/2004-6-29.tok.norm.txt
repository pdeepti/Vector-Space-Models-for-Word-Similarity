while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .
each of the governments generally aims to suggest candidates that the other member states will be satisfied with , who the european parliament must then confirm . the new commission will start its work on november 1 .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .

he 's just moving with the tide as he sees it , taking his talent to where the fashion current 's flowing . " because people who buy chanel and other expensive things buy there , too , " he said in an interview .
" for me , this is fashion today .
people wear t-shirts and jeans with exceptional things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m shop starting in november , lagerfeld 's small line of clothing and accessories he is designing , called " karl lagerfeld for h & m , " will appear on store racks at the swedish retailer , which specializes in serving up a non-stop stream of catwalk-inspired fashions priced for the hoi polloi . en vogue for very little the retailer , which opened its first shop in a stockholm suburb in 1947 , has hit fashion gold with its strategy of providing the dernier cri at inexpensive prices , with store collections that change at dizzying speeds . today h & m has 991 stores in 19 countries and more than 40,000 employees worldwide . for lagerfeld , the concept is fascinating , and he dismisses those turned-up noses who pooh-pooh anything that can be bought off a rack .
it is " incredibly snobbish " he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper , and " fatal " to sneer at the masses .
besides , cheap does n't necessarily mean low-quality in this day and age . " -lsb- h & m -rsb- sent me a suit - € 49 - it 's divine , " lagerfeld gushed .
" it 's unbelievable - the fit , everything .
a lot of suits costing € 300 are not as good as this one . " lagerfeld himself , once on the pudgy side but now as skinny as some of the models wearing his creations , will even appear in the advertisements for the new line .
but do n't expect him to be bringing out a winter line for wal-mart . " i 'm doing this just once , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel , " because it amuses me . " for those chanel aficionados who ca n't live without their gold c 's and big-buttoned suits , not to worry , lagerfeld is n't abandoning his high-class roots .
besides being busy with the preparations for the mass-market début , he 's also putting the final touches on chanel 's haute couture collection in paris . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .

we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "

" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation .

but now berliners are standing up for their rights . it all began with a business-friendly proposal : berlin 's city leaders recently cut some red tape and allowed owners of small restaurants to provide a unisex restroom instead of separate ones for men and women . pubs and bistros below 50 square meters -lrb- 538 square feet -rrb- in size will only have to install one toilet from now on .
those that do n't offer alcohol and have less than 40 square meters do n't even have to offer a wc , or water closet , at all , as germans commonly refer to the place . that 's all great and dandy , the folks at berlin 's restaurateurs ' association thought .
but knowing how messy men get when they 're not forced to sit down , the group has called for a ban on stehpinkeln , or peeing while standing , in the new his and hers toilets . german tabloid bild did n't wait long to take up the issue and surveyed berlin men about the proposal .
not one of them supported the idea and arguments ranged from fears of contracting diseases to disgust to seeing it as a waste of time . " men have been peeing standing up for several centuries , " 43-year-old ali , a scaffolder , told the paper .
" i 'm not going to let anyone take that away from me . " bernd meyer , a 16-year-old student , kept his calm , however .
" i do n't care what they 'll tell me , " he said .
" everyone does what he wants in the loo anyway . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wordy wastebaskets berlin partygoers may come to the conclusion they had one too many to drink when rubbish bins start shouting at them on the city 's streets .
but the talking trashcans are n't a figment of inebriated imaginations .
-lrb- april 22 , 2004 -rrb- is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .
the mass party , which at its peak had 1.5 million dancing through berlin 's streets , ca n't find financing .
-lrb- april 14 , 2004 -rrb- berliner beach blanket bingo berlin may be landlocked , but that won ’ t keep the denizens of germany ’ s largest concrete jungle from having a beach party this summer , as sand and beach chairs have sprung up along the banks of the river spree .
-lrb- june 21 , 2003 -rrb- feedback what do you think of the proposal to impose a ban on standing while peeing in restaurants ?

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .
by comparison , u.s. oil company halliburton alone has lost 40 of its employees in iraq since beginning operations there . andreas becker -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german firms slow to enter iraq reconstructing iraq has opened up vast opportunity for international companies , but german businesses have been slow to claim their slice of the pie .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .
by comparison , u.s. oil company halliburton alone has lost 40 of its employees in iraq since beginning operations there . andreas becker -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .

" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .

he 's just moving with the tide as he sees it , taking his talent to where the fashion current 's flowing . " because people who buy chanel and other expensive things buy there , too , " he said in an interview .
" for me , this is fashion today .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m shop starting in november , lagerfeld 's small line of clothing and accessories he is designing , called " karl lagerfeld for h & m , " will appear on store racks at the swedish retailer , which specializes in serving up a non-stop stream of catwalk-inspired fashions priced for the hoi polloi . en vogue for very little the retailer , which opened its first shop in a stockholm suburb in 1947 , has hit fashion gold with its strategy of providing the dernier cri at inexpensive prices , with store collections that change at dizzying speeds . today h & m has 991 stores in 19 countries and more than 40,000 employees worldwide . for lagerfeld , the concept is fascinating , and he dismisses those turned-up noses who pooh-pooh anything that can be bought off a rack .
it is " incredibly snobbish " he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper , and " fatal " to sneer at the masses .
besides , cheap does n't necessarily mean low-quality in this day and age . " -lsb- h & m -rsb- sent me a suit - € 49 - it 's divine , " lagerfeld gushed .
" it 's unbelievable - the fit , everything .
a lot of suits costing € 300 are not as good as this one . " lagerfeld himself , once on the pudgy side but now as skinny as some of the models wearing his creations , will even appear in the advertisements for the new line .
but do n't expect him to be bringing out a winter line for wal-mart . " i 'm doing this just once , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel , " because it amuses me . " for those chanel aficionados who ca n't live without their gold c 's and big-buttoned suits , not to worry , lagerfeld is n't abandoning his high-class roots .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m shop starting in november , lagerfeld 's small line of clothing and accessories he is designing , called " karl lagerfeld for h & m , " will appear on store racks at the swedish retailer , which specializes in serving up a non-stop stream of catwalk-inspired fashions priced for the hoi polloi . en vogue for very little the retailer , which opened its first shop in a stockholm suburb in 1947 , has hit fashion gold with its strategy of providing the dernier cri at inexpensive prices , with store collections that change at dizzying speeds . today h & m has 991 stores in 19 countries and more than 40,000 employees worldwide . for lagerfeld , the concept is fascinating , and he dismisses those turned-up noses who pooh-pooh anything that can be bought off a rack .
it is " incredibly snobbish " he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper , and " fatal " to sneer at the masses .
besides , cheap does n't necessarily mean low-quality in this day and age . " -lsb- h & m -rsb- sent me a suit - € 49 - it 's divine , " lagerfeld gushed .
" it 's unbelievable - the fit , everything .
a lot of suits costing € 300 are not as good as this one . " lagerfeld himself , once on the pudgy side but now as skinny as some of the models wearing his creations , will even appear in the advertisements for the new line .
but do n't expect him to be bringing out a winter line for wal-mart . " i 'm doing this just once , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel , " because it amuses me . " for those chanel aficionados who ca n't live without their gold c 's and big-buttoned suits , not to worry , lagerfeld is n't abandoning his high-class roots .
besides being busy with the preparations for the mass-market début , he 's also putting the final touches on chanel 's haute couture collection in paris . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .

goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 .

greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .
each of the governments generally aims to suggest candidates that the other member states will be satisfied with , who the european parliament must then confirm . the new commission will start its work on november 1 .
large countries , like germany , which have so far fielded two commissioners for the body , will only fill one spot as the commission will grow from 19 to 25 due to the recent eu enlargement . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .

" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .

but now berliners are standing up for their rights . it all began with a business-friendly proposal : berlin 's city leaders recently cut some red tape and allowed owners of small restaurants to provide a unisex restroom instead of separate ones for men and women . pubs and bistros below 50 square meters -lrb- 538 square feet -rrb- in size will only have to install one toilet from now on .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

he 's just moving with the tide as he sees it , taking his talent to where the fashion current 's flowing . " because people who buy chanel and other expensive things buy there , too , " he said in an interview .
" for me , this is fashion today .
people wear t-shirts and jeans with exceptional things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m shop starting in november , lagerfeld 's small line of clothing and accessories he is designing , called " karl lagerfeld for h & m , " will appear on store racks at the swedish retailer , which specializes in serving up a non-stop stream of catwalk-inspired fashions priced for the hoi polloi . en vogue for very little the retailer , which opened its first shop in a stockholm suburb in 1947 , has hit fashion gold with its strategy of providing the dernier cri at inexpensive prices , with store collections that change at dizzying speeds . today h & m has 991 stores in 19 countries and more than 40,000 employees worldwide . for lagerfeld , the concept is fascinating , and he dismisses those turned-up noses who pooh-pooh anything that can be bought off a rack .
it is " incredibly snobbish " he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper , and " fatal " to sneer at the masses .
besides , cheap does n't necessarily mean low-quality in this day and age . " -lsb- h & m -rsb- sent me a suit - € 49 - it 's divine , " lagerfeld gushed .
" it 's unbelievable - the fit , everything .
a lot of suits costing € 300 are not as good as this one . " lagerfeld himself , once on the pudgy side but now as skinny as some of the models wearing his creations , will even appear in the advertisements for the new line .
but do n't expect him to be bringing out a winter line for wal-mart . " i 'm doing this just once , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel , " because it amuses me . " for those chanel aficionados who ca n't live without their gold c 's and big-buttoned suits , not to worry , lagerfeld is n't abandoning his high-class roots .

but now berliners are standing up for their rights . it all began with a business-friendly proposal : berlin 's city leaders recently cut some red tape and allowed owners of small restaurants to provide a unisex restroom instead of separate ones for men and women . pubs and bistros below 50 square meters -lrb- 538 square feet -rrb- in size will only have to install one toilet from now on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the iraqis are in charge , german firms may have a chance german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals . after the handover of power , the iraqi authorities will increasingly be able to decide for themselves which companies should be awarded contracts .
the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .
by comparison , u.s. oil company halliburton alone has lost 40 of its employees in iraq since beginning operations there . andreas becker -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german firms slow to enter iraq reconstructing iraq has opened up vast opportunity for international companies , but german businesses have been slow to claim their slice of the pie .

that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .

" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .
the union had to acknowledge the fact that cooperation to fight terrorism had not improved much since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c. as a result , the irish presidency pushed for a eu anti-terrorism czar at a brussels summit . " as we 've seen , terrorism is not confined within national borders and we need to enhance our international cooperation , " ahern said .
" the declaration underlines the central role of the united nations and it underscores the need to continue to enhance our cooperation with partners , including the united states , but all regions of the world . " expanding the union after managing these crises during the first three months of the presidency , ireland was gearing up to the climactic events of may 1 : the eu formally welcomed 10 new member states at a celebration in the irish capital , dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in prague , europeans everywhere celebrated the union 's enlargement on may 1 .
" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .
it will give us a framework in which we can grow and prosper into the future .
it is a great achievement for europe , it is a great achievement for all europeans . " keeping promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- also made good on his last promise : after eu leaders failed to agree on a new eu commission president at their meeting in brussels in mid-june , the irish premier said he wanted to resolve that issue before handing over the presidency to his dutch colleague on july 1 .
by monday , ahern had found an acceptable candidate : portuguese prime minister jose manuel durão barroso is expected to get the backing of his eu colleagues at a meeting tuesday night . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .

the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 luck o ' the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish eu presidency has been touched by a four-leaf clover ireland can be pleased with its eu presidency , which ends on wednesday : under the country 's leadership , the union welcomed 10 new members , agreed on a new constitution and found a new eu commission president . irish prime minister bertie ahern had probably hoped for an easier starting point for his six-month eu presidency when he took over in january .
he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .
the union had to acknowledge the fact that cooperation to fight terrorism had not improved much since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c. as a result , the irish presidency pushed for a eu anti-terrorism czar at a brussels summit . " as we 've seen , terrorism is not confined within national borders and we need to enhance our international cooperation , " ahern said .
" the declaration underlines the central role of the united nations and it underscores the need to continue to enhance our cooperation with partners , including the united states , but all regions of the world . " expanding the union after managing these crises during the first three months of the presidency , ireland was gearing up to the climactic events of may 1 : the eu formally welcomed 10 new member states at a celebration in the irish capital , dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in prague , europeans everywhere celebrated the union 's enlargement on may 1 .
" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .
it will give us a framework in which we can grow and prosper into the future .
it is a great achievement for europe , it is a great achievement for all europeans . " keeping promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- also made good on his last promise : after eu leaders failed to agree on a new eu commission president at their meeting in brussels in mid-june , the irish premier said he wanted to resolve that issue before handing over the presidency to his dutch colleague on july 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.06.2004 nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigh-in : nato leaders gather before trading verbal punches nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .
but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

he 's just moving with the tide as he sees it , taking his talent to where the fashion current 's flowing . " because people who buy chanel and other expensive things buy there , too , " he said in an interview .

it is " incredibly snobbish " he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper , and " fatal " to sneer at the masses .
besides , cheap does n't necessarily mean low-quality in this day and age . " -lsb- h & m -rsb- sent me a suit - € 49 - it 's divine , " lagerfeld gushed .
" it 's unbelievable - the fit , everything .
a lot of suits costing € 300 are not as good as this one . " lagerfeld himself , once on the pudgy side but now as skinny as some of the models wearing his creations , will even appear in the advertisements for the new line .
but do n't expect him to be bringing out a winter line for wal-mart . " i 'm doing this just once , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel , " because it amuses me . " for those chanel aficionados who ca n't live without their gold c 's and big-buttoned suits , not to worry , lagerfeld is n't abandoning his high-class roots .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .

" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .
each of the governments generally aims to suggest candidates that the other member states will be satisfied with , who the european parliament must then confirm . the new commission will start its work on november 1 .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .

responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq .

for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .

she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .

that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .

" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .

11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c. as a result , the irish presidency pushed for a eu anti-terrorism czar at a brussels summit . " as we 've seen , terrorism is not confined within national borders and we need to enhance our international cooperation , " ahern said .
" the declaration underlines the central role of the united nations and it underscores the need to continue to enhance our cooperation with partners , including the united states , but all regions of the world . " expanding the union after managing these crises during the first three months of the presidency , ireland was gearing up to the climactic events of may 1 : the eu formally welcomed 10 new member states at a celebration in the irish capital , dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in prague , europeans everywhere celebrated the union 's enlargement on may 1 .
" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .
it will give us a framework in which we can grow and prosper into the future .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .

but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .

cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .
that may partly have to do with the extensive legal work required before a contract with a company can be sealed . but it 's also an indication that companies are no longer in a position where they can readily loosen their purse-strings for such an honorable cause . ralf lehnert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de juggling research and diplomacy as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east .

but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .

cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .

under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .

" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation .

cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .
that may partly have to do with the extensive legal work required before a contract with a company can be sealed . but it 's also an indication that companies are no longer in a position where they can readily loosen their purse-strings for such an honorable cause . ralf lehnert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de juggling research and diplomacy as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the iraqis are in charge , german firms may have a chance german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals . after the handover of power , the iraqi authorities will increasingly be able to decide for themselves which companies should be awarded contracts .
the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .

that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.06.2004 nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigh-in : nato leaders gather before trading verbal punches nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .
but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .

it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .

responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .

" the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .

" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .

that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .

goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 .

" we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .
that may partly have to do with the extensive legal work required before a contract with a company can be sealed . but it 's also an indication that companies are no longer in a position where they can readily loosen their purse-strings for such an honorable cause . ralf lehnert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de juggling research and diplomacy as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east .

cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .

2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .

" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .

cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .

2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .

" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2004 new money needed for world 's ancient monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmistakably cologne - the city 's cathedral is a world heritage site from the angkor wat to the olympia ruins , the list of world heritage sites is growing longer and its conservation costs skyrocketing .
cash-strapped unesco needs to attract more private funds to its historic sites . the idea underlying unesco 's list of world heritage sites is a noble one - that a number of the world 's ancient monuments are of such exceptional value and significance that their preservation should be a global concern and not just left to the countries where the sites are located . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an armed afghan man stands guard near the destroyed buddha statue in bamiyan , central afghanistan , which is a world heritage site .
since the " convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage " was set up in 1972 , 754 treasures from 129 countries including afghanistan and iraq have made it to the list of world heritage sites . ranging from the pyramids of giza to the great wall of china , the list may embrace just a small part of our universal heritage , but it 's already posing major challenges to unesco 's conservation efforts . dire financial straits part of the problem is an ever growing number of countries knocking at unesco 's door to get " world heritage site " status for their monuments and natural treasures .
a ten-day meeting of the governing committee of unesco 's world heritage sites , which got underway in china yesterday , is expected to consider 41 such applications . the tougher hurdle however , is money .
the preservation of nearly a thousand sites around the world takes lots of it .
but with an annual budget of about $ 2 million for its world heritage sites , it 's obvious that unesco falls well short of the goal . dieter offenhäuser , spokesman for the german unesco commission in bonn told dw-world that the cash crunch was exacerbated by the fact that most of unesco 's world heritage funds are used to help poor countries apply for sponsorship or help out in emergencies such as in iraq , where much of the country 's ancient heritage is threatened by the recent war and ongoing insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. mark 's square in venice .
the entire city is a world heritage site .
" that 's not the kind of money that would suffice to preserve 754 sites worldwide , " offenhäuser said .
" if you take just the problem facing venice alone ...
2 million is a mere drop in the ocean - the ocean which is increasingly threatening to lap at the foundations of this city . " looking towards the private sector to be fair , it 's not just the u.n. body that is to blame for failing to provide sufficient funds to conserve the world heritage sites .
under the terms of the 1972 agreement , it 's a matter of prestige for countries to be accepted to the world heritage site list , but the individual governments are expected to provide safety and protection for the places they register . not all countries can afford to do that .
even in rich nations , state funds for conservation efforts are rapidly drying up .
the world heritage sites are thus forced to look for alternative sources of funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodian buddhist monks gaze out of the ruins of angkor wat .
" we have to increasingly fall back on private funding in the field of conservation of world heritage , " offen häuser said .
he points to the ruins of cambodia 's angkor with its world famous angkor wat as an example of how private sector involvement in conservation can yield results .
" there 's a private company there that demands an entrance fee to the temple and the funds are in turn used to protect the site , " he said . conflicting interests but experts say that encouraging the private sector to help out in conservation efforts can bring its own share of problems . marie-therese albert , who holds the unesco chair for world heritage at the brandenburg technical university in cottbus said increased private sector involvement in conservation was principally a good thing , but added there was a danger that the interests of the sponsors conflicted with the idea of world heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of berlin 's museum island .
" if a large company , which protects world heritage sites like the cologne cathedral or the berlin museum island , sticks their large logos on it , then i think it misses the point because it destroys the whole impression of the site , " she said . albert added that the companies are free to advertise their heritage-consciousness in brochures . in search of elusive funds a scheme launched by unesco in 2002 to persuade the private sector to help in its conservation efforts shows how difficult it is to juggle the interests of companies with the idea of world heritage preservation . " to date we 've managed to sign agreements with just a handful of companies , " said joanna sullivan of the unesco initiative , pact in paris .
that may partly have to do with the extensive legal work required before a contract with a company can be sealed . but it 's also an indication that companies are no longer in a position where they can readily loosen their purse-strings for such an honorable cause . ralf lehnert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de juggling research and diplomacy as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east .

" this report is n't ready to be presented to the government , " commission member helmut seitz wrote in an open letter to the group 's leader , klaus von dohnanyi .
seitz said the report represented dohnanyi 's opinions more than any group consensus .
the report suggests doing away with the infrastructure aid that 's been given to the states belonging to the former communist east germany ever since german reunification in 1990 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.06.2004 nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigh-in : nato leaders gather before trading verbal punches nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .
but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .
after the u.s. president urged european leaders to give turkey a firm date for starting eu membership talks later this year , jacques chirac bluntly bush to mind his own business . turkey comments turn chirac on bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush called for the eu to speed up turkey 's entry to the bloc .
finally succumbing to his own desire to ignore the determined effort to celebrate improved transatlantic relations after the iraq crisis , chirac complained that bush , " not only went too far but went on to territory which is not his own . "
he added : " it 's as if i was advising the u.s. on how they should manage their relations with mexico . " for a summit designed to help soothe the tensions between leaders , day one had been a bumpy affair .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .

" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election .

nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .
before the first day came to a close , bush and chirac stepped into the ring for a final bout .

but it was not the smooth passage many had hoped for . meeting for the first time since the iraq war opened up deep divisions within the alliance , the leaders of north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- member states strove to set aside the disagreements of the past and show a united front at the two-day summit in istanbul which began on monday . and as the source of recent friction between members , it was only fitting that iraq dominated the summit from the start . it could n't have been a better opening for u.s. president george w. bush and coalition partner tony blair , the british prime minister .
as the architects of the invasion which had caused such division within nato , news that the u.s.-led administration had handed over power to an iraqi government 48 hours ahead of schedule was as good a way as any of preventing the wind of discontent filling the sails of opposition . " the iraqi people have their country back , " declared bush .
" fifteen months after the liberation of iraq and two days ahead of schedule , the world witnessed the arrival of a full sovereign and free iraq . "
it was to be a welcome buffer for the president as the subject of iraq would go on to swallow up much of monday 's agenda with those harboring concerns waiting for the opportunity to let go their restraint . one powerful opponent of the iraq war offered muted congratulations tinged with a hidden animosity that would fully rear its head later in the day .
" we are naturally delighted .
in my eyes , the return of iraq ’ s sovereignty is a necessary condition although , alas , not sufficient , for restoring peace , " said french president jacques chirac who led the other nato leaders in offering their opinions of developments . new iraqi government requests nato help then it was time to get to work .
responding to a request from iyad allawi , the prime minister of the interim iraqi government that had only hours before assumed power , the negotiators and leaders began discussing whether to give the alliance a direct role in providing military training for iraq 's armed forces .
it was not to be easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his postion on iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , another leader firmly in opposition to the war , chose the summit to reiterate his position on german troop deployments , even as part of nato .
before discussions began , schröder said : " we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that .
but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . " germany , france oppose deployment once discussions had begun , france soon rejected u.s. suggestions that the training would lead to a formal , high-profile alliance presence in the country .
" it is not in the mission conferred upon nato , so it won ’ t happen , " said jacques chirac .
" any trace of nato on iraqi soil was considered as inopportune . "
chirac and schröder then stated that they would not be sending military instructors to iraq , insisting any training will be outside the country . " there will be no military engagement of our own , no german soldiers in iraq , " schröder again reiterated , adding that germany was making available army training facilities along with its continuing work instructing iraq police officers in the united arab emirates .
finally , the discussions came to an interim agreement which would see nato train the iraqi military and police forces with conditions to appease germany and france .
diplomats said that to win the endorsement of germany and france , the agreement allows for the possibility that some of the training will take place outside iraq .
but in the spirit of compromise , at the insistence of the bush administration , the operation will be a formal nato mission rather than a project of individual countries . " we are united in our support for the iraqi people and offer full co-operation to the new sovereign interim government as it seeks to strengthen internal security , " the 26 leaders said in a statement .
details of the agreement , including who will be trained , where and when , must still be worked out by the governments , nato officials added .
it is thought that the alliance may start by offering instruction to senior iraqi officers at military schools in rome and oberammergau , germany , and then expand to include training in iraq .
afghanistan causes more u.s.-franco friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac challenged rumsfeld and then bush .
the agenda then moved onto the alliance 's involvement in afghanistan .
the sparring soon began again when donald rumsfeld , the us defense secretary , called for nato to deploy its elite new response force to protect the coming afghan elections .
enter chirac : " that force is meant to act in a known crisis , which is obviously not the case in afghanistan today " , the french president argued .
" a nato presence too clear and too numerous is perhaps not what is politically the wisest and most reasonable thing ahead of an election . " in the end , the nato leaders agreed to extend nato 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by sending more than 3,000 additional troops to bolster security for september elections .
nato will also send permanent military teams to four more cities as part of phased expansion out of the capital , kabul .
in addition to expanding its afghan mission , the alliance agreed to end its peacekeeping operation in bosnia after nine years , handing responsibility for the 7,500-strong mission to the european union at the end of the year .

but now berliners are standing up for their rights . it all began with a business-friendly proposal : berlin 's city leaders recently cut some red tape and allowed owners of small restaurants to provide a unisex restroom instead of separate ones for men and women . pubs and bistros below 50 square meters -lrb- 538 square feet -rrb- in size will only have to install one toilet from now on .
those that do n't offer alcohol and have less than 40 square meters do n't even have to offer a wc , or water closet , at all , as germans commonly refer to the place . that 's all great and dandy , the folks at berlin 's restaurateurs ' association thought .
but knowing how messy men get when they 're not forced to sit down , the group has called for a ban on stehpinkeln , or peeing while standing , in the new his and hers toilets . german tabloid bild did n't wait long to take up the issue and surveyed berlin men about the proposal .
not one of them supported the idea and arguments ranged from fears of contracting diseases to disgust to seeing it as a waste of time . " men have been peeing standing up for several centuries , " 43-year-old ali , a scaffolder , told the paper .
" i 'm not going to let anyone take that away from me . " bernd meyer , a 16-year-old student , kept his calm , however .
" i do n't care what they 'll tell me , " he said .
" everyone does what he wants in the loo anyway .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .
each of the governments generally aims to suggest candidates that the other member states will be satisfied with , who the european parliament must then confirm . the new commission will start its work on november 1 .

but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic . chancellor gerhard schröder has made it clear that germany will suggest günter verheugen to be the country 's one commissioner on the european union 's executive body . " günter verheugen is one of the most respected commissioners in the current commission in brussels , " government spokesman hans langguth told reporters monday in berlin . " his work is praised everywhere there , and incidentally , it is also praised by the german opposition .
the federal government will , as a matter of course , nominate günter verheugen for the office of german commissioner , " he added . schröder stressed over the weekend that the one german in the european commission should be responsible for economic policy .
for some time , germany , along with france and britain , has championed creating the new position to coordinate all business and economic issues within the commission .
the officeholder would also be vice president of the body . germany 's conservative opposition has backed schröder in pushing for a commissioner for economics , but its politicians remain skeptical about verheugen , a social democrat like schröder , filling the position .
" from my point of view , it 's inappropriate now to make this decision so quickly because it ultimately hampers us in the search for a suitable candidate , " christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel commented . opposition criticism merkel criticized that the cdu was n't consulted before the decision to nominate verheugen was made .
she did acknowledge that verheugen had built a solid reputation through his work since 1999 as the eu 's commissioner for expansion , a job that effectively came to an end when 10 new member states joined the eu on june 1 .
but she said a proven specialist in business and economics should fill the new post .
other opposition politicians have mooted the name of merkel 's deputy , friedrich merz , the cdu 's financial expert , for the post . but government spokesman langguth dismissed merkel 's comments , saying that they were merely motivated by partisan considerations .
the fact is , the government is n't obliged to pay heed to the opposition 's criticism , since it alone is responsible for nominating a german commission member .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .

that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 luck o ' the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish eu presidency has been touched by a four-leaf clover ireland can be pleased with its eu presidency , which ends on wednesday : under the country 's leadership , the union welcomed 10 new members , agreed on a new constitution and found a new eu commission president . irish prime minister bertie ahern had probably hoped for an easier starting point for his six-month eu presidency when he took over in january .
he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .
the union had to acknowledge the fact that cooperation to fight terrorism had not improved much since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c. as a result , the irish presidency pushed for a eu anti-terrorism czar at a brussels summit . " as we 've seen , terrorism is not confined within national borders and we need to enhance our international cooperation , " ahern said .
" the declaration underlines the central role of the united nations and it underscores the need to continue to enhance our cooperation with partners , including the united states , but all regions of the world . " expanding the union after managing these crises during the first three months of the presidency , ireland was gearing up to the climactic events of may 1 : the eu formally welcomed 10 new member states at a celebration in the irish capital , dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in prague , europeans everywhere celebrated the union 's enlargement on may 1 .
" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .
it will enable the union to do its work in a more efficient and effective manner .
it will give us a framework in which we can grow and prosper into the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the iraqis are in charge , german firms may have a chance german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals . after the handover of power , the iraqi authorities will increasingly be able to decide for themselves which companies should be awarded contracts .
the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .
by comparison , u.s. oil company halliburton alone has lost 40 of its employees in iraq since beginning operations there . andreas becker -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german firms slow to enter iraq reconstructing iraq has opened up vast opportunity for international companies , but german businesses have been slow to claim their slice of the pie .
a german-iraqi economic congress aims to change that .
-lrb- april 2 , 2004 -rrb- u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .
fewer than 20 employees from german companies were working in iraq in late june , according to the dihk .
by comparison , u.s. oil company halliburton alone has lost 40 of its employees in iraq since beginning operations there . andreas becker -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule on monday morning , paul bremer , the u.s. administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german firms slow to enter iraq reconstructing iraq has opened up vast opportunity for international companies , but german businesses have been slow to claim their slice of the pie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2004 german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the iraqis are in charge , german firms may have a chance german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals . after the handover of power , the iraqi authorities will increasingly be able to decide for themselves which companies should be awarded contracts .
the money will come from iraqi oil profits which so far has gone into a reconstruction fund that was controlled by the united states and britain . but now german companies have greater chances to bid for tenders .
hans-jürgen müller from the german wholesale and foreign trade association bga reckoned that , above all , local firms would benefit from the contracts awarded by the iraqi authorities .
but german companies ' good reputation in iraq would open doors for them , too . " when iraqi companies participate in tenders , they can bring in german firms as sub-contractors .
and they are sure to do that in technical fields that initially concern spare parts and later machine supplies , too , " müller told deutsche welle . german companies exported products worth € 200 million -lrb- $ 243 million -rrb- to iraq in 2003 .
the german chambers of trade and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- has predicted that the volume will increase beyond that this year , though it has n't released estimates .
that 's peanuts compared to the past .
in 1982 , before the war between iran and iraq , germany exported products worth € 4 billion to iraq . mere crumbs at the moment , the money is to be had from projects to rebuild the infrastructure , one of the country 's first priorities .
the most lucrative tenders involve building streets and bridges , telecommunication networks and water and energy utilities .
very few german companies are active in iraq yet , and those that are are at most sub-contractors for american companies , which have acquired the lion 's share of the contracts . " the europeans are supposed to help with rebuilding iraq , but the fact is that all big iraq contracts have long gone via the political route and via the financial power of the americans , " the head of the association of german construction industry , ignaz walter , criticized at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" the crumbs are now being portioned out , and the europeans get to make losses .
in return though , they have to build for which they have to make losses - an inconceivable procedure , " reuters quoted him as saying . in march , the u.s. government awarded construction contracts worth around $ 5 billion to companies from countries that backed the iraq war .
that 's not likely to change soon , müller indicated , commenting that german firms have poor chances winning contracts in the u.s.-influenced system of international tenders . in the past , german companies have tried to get involved in business in iraq as sub-contractors for firms from kuwait or the united arab emirates .
then at least they are not subject to the americans ' goodwill , müller pointed out .
since mid-june an office set up by the dihk in amman , jordan aims to put german firms in touch with business partners in iraq and other persian gulf countries .
the dihk also plans to establish a german-iraqi chamber of commerce . security situation hampers business but the instable security situation in iraq remains the greatest hindrance to business endeavors .
around 40 soldiers and civilians are the victims of attacks each day .
" thus , the inclination to operate business directly in iraq - that is , not via foreign partners , that usually supply personnel , too - is still low , " müller said .
german engineering giant siemens , which is involved in constructing a mobile phone network and in building nuclear plants , only deploys its personnel for very short stints in iraq and only after carrying out exhaustive security checks .

though the chemical carrier 's tanks were n't ruptured , the accident caused some of the liquid to escape via the ventilation system , firefighters said .
nine port employees and two police officers were hospitalized for breathing difficulties after inhaling the gas , said fire department spokesman peter braun .
emergency services began work early on tuesday to pump the remaining sulfuric acid out of the double-hulled vessel and to refloat the tanker , which sank at dockside .
officials said reports that the captain of the german-registered tanker had been drunk at the time of collision were being investigated .
no significant damage was reported on the container ship , which left the harbor shortly after the accident . more briefs 29.06.2004 -pipe- military ceremony marks president rau 's exit 28.06.2004 -pipe- schröder wants verheugen to remain eu commissioner 28.06.2004 -pipe- german dentist to referee euro 2004 final 28.06.2004 -pipe- economics minister threatens to quit if reforms fail 25.06.2004 -pipe- law banning headscarves " constitutional " says court 25.06.2004 -pipe- t-mobile names tour de france team 25.06.2004 -pipe- german internet domains top global porn study 25.06.2004 -pipe- ruling on former nazi officer overturned radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week . when electronics giant siemens and trade union representatives recently agreed to re-introduce the 40-hour work week at two german plants in return for a two-year job guarantee , some employers and conservative politicians hailed the deal as a way to secure jobs . union leaders meanwhile vehemently opposed the idea , saying that they had only agreed to the siemens deal because the company , which had threatened to move 2,000 jobs to hungary , agreed to invest in german factories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of germany 's metal workers ' union , ig metall , said that a universal 40-hour work week would serve as the country 's " biggest job destruction program since world war ii " and denied reports that hundreds of german companies were trying to follow siemens ' lead . but longer work weeks have been a topic during the current contract negotiations for 800,000 employees in the construction industry as well as 150,000 people employed by germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn . six million unemployed ? peters added that unemployment figures would quickly rise should the work week be extended , leaving a total of six million germans without jobs .
currently , about 4.3 million people are unemployed . but experts from the federal agency that handles unemployment said the debate about an extended work week was futile as most germans de facto work 40 hours .
" we 're not that bad , " eugen spitznagel from the federal labor agency 's economic research institute , iab , told berliner zeitung . while germany 's average work week with 37.7 hours ranked among the shorter ones when compared to other eu countries , most people actually ended up working longer than contractually required , bumping the actual work week to 39.9 hours , spitznagel said .
that puts the country just below the average work week of the 15 old eu countries , which is exactly 40 hours . labor contracts already require greeks , poles and hungarians to work 40 hours per week , while workers in france only have to spend 35 hours on the job . a risk of deflation ? other economic experts cautioned however that extending the work week could actually harm germany 's economy : the resulting lower hourly wages would dampen consumer spending and lead to decreasing prices .
" should the 40-hour work week become the norm here , we would face a risk of deflation , " peter bofinger , a member of the government 's economic advisory council , told berliner zeitung . while some companies , such as carmaker bmw , said they planned to look at longer work weeks in certain sectors , others , including deutsche post , already have flexible contracts in place that allow work weeks with up to 48 hours . at telekom , however , executives said a longer work week was the last thing they needed .
" our problem is n't that we have too much work to do , but rather too little , considering the number of employees , " said the company 's ceo , kai-uwe ricke , adding that telekom had recently lowered its average work week to 34 hours . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace . " if you talk about a two-speed europe where a group of countries oblivious to everybody else 's desires would come together on an initiative that would not be open for others and would move ahead , i have major difficulties with that , " he said . terror attacks unify the bloc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands protested against the madrid terror attacks the madrid terror attacks on march 11 that killed 191 people and injured thousands more brought europeans closer again .

" on this landmark day for the people of europe we gather to bid a warm welcome to the 10 member states who are joining the family circle that is the european union , " said irish president mary mcaleese , who hosted the festivities at her official residence . the enlarged union quickly returned to business and began tackling the proposed constitution again .
while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .
in june , ahern finally managed to propose a list of changes to the constitution that was agreeable to all . " this constitution treaty will enable the european union to become more transparent and more democratic , " he said .
" it sets out the powers of the member states and the union in a clear way .

he faced a somewhat subdued union after negotiations over a proposed eu constitution under italy 's leadership failed in december . in france , people had already begun mulling alternatives : they began thinking about closer cooperation with germany should the 25-nation bloc be unable to move forward .
britain also seemed willing to join such an avantgarde group that would help to push the eu ahead . such thoughts did n't sit well with ahern , however , who argued strongly against creating a " core europe " that would pursue unification at a faster pace .

while spain under conservative prime minister jose maria aznar had blocked adoption of the document because of voting rights , his successor , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , showed more willingness to compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.06.2004 siemens secures longer working hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adjusting working hours : siemens workers will now work more for the same pay .
with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany . everyone agrees that times are tough in germany .
the unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly above the 10 percent mark for months . an increasing number of companies are slashing jobs and relocating production facilities abroad , where labor costs less and corporate tax rates are lower .
it 's no wonder the average german worker is worried . siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , issued an announcement in march stating that it would cut some 2,000 jobs at plants in bocholt and kamp lintfort .
it threatened to move them to hungary if unions did not make concessions to help reduce personnel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens headquarters in munich .
in recent years , the industrial giant has shaved 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut personnel costs by $ 30 billion . the latest events in this long saga have been closely followed by workers throughout the country .
the situation at siemens is similar to that at many german companies and the outcome could have far-reaching implications . ig metall agrees to 40-hour week on thursday , ig metall , the trade union representing siemens workers , reached an agreement with the company 's management .
in exchange for a two-year guarantee not to relocate the jobs and a promise to invest an additional € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.4 million -rrb- in the factories , workers agreed to work an additional five hours a week at no extra pay .
this will bump their total number of hours per week up from 35 to 40 . the decision by ig metall workers to accept longer hours signals a significant reversal on a previously sacred issue , the 35-hour work week .
the limit was a hard-won victory for the powerful union , established after a seven-week strike in 1984 . companies have long loathed the 35-hour work week .
its abandonment is symbolic of the new realities in germany . companies , unions struggle with new realities german labor costs are the highest in the european union , a fact that has not escaped the attention of ceo 's .
companies need to cut costs , executives say , or they will have no choice but to relocate jobs elsewhere .
in march , even ludwig georg bauer , president of the german chamber of commerce and industry , recommended that german companies move production to low-wage eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , fewer german children will have the chance to work for volkswagen like their parents .
and despite german chancellor gerhard schröder 's protests that such a move would be " unpatriotic , " neither he nor anyone else has been able to stem the tide .
volkswagen produces numerous models at its slovak factory , which employs thousands , and is planning to cut 2,500 jobs at its german plant in wolfsburg . so when siemens managers threatened to do the same , they exercised significant leverage over ig metall , which knew the risk was all too real . the trend towards longer hours now that ig metall has given in , others are likely to follow suit and spark a trend towards longer hours throughout the country , say many experts .
employees at germany 's national railway deutsche bahn , daimler chrysler , and civil servants will negotiate new labor contracts this year .
the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

the precedent set in the siemens case will no doubt affect the outcome .
the experts are divided on whether that 's a good thing . " those who think they can improve the ability of german firms to compete internationally via salary reductions and the seemingly endless extension of the working day will only face the same problem in one or two years , " steffen lehndorff , a labor expert at the gelsenkirchen institute for work and technology , told the berliner zeitung daily .
" it 's an endless downward spiral , " he added , pointing out that siemens workers only won a two-year commitment . hagen lesch , a labor expert at the cologne institute for business research , sees the outcome in a more positive light .
" i hope it 's the start of a trend , " lesch told dw-world .
" of course , it 's a good thing if it secures jobs in germany .
extending the length of the working week is an excellent tool to sink the cost of production in germany - and ensure that german firms can compete internationally . " in contrast to lehndorff , lesch believes siemens workers will not find themselves in the same position in two years time , since the company has also agreed to invest substantial sums in the two german factories .
this makes it less likely they will leave it all behind to then have to invest in new facilities in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

but now berliners are standing up for their rights . it all began with a business-friendly proposal : berlin 's city leaders recently cut some red tape and allowed owners of small restaurants to provide a unisex restroom instead of separate ones for men and women . pubs and bistros below 50 square meters -lrb- 538 square feet -rrb- in size will only have to install one toilet from now on .
those that do n't offer alcohol and have less than 40 square meters do n't even have to offer a wc , or water closet , at all , as germans commonly refer to the place . that 's all great and dandy , the folks at berlin 's restaurateurs ' association thought .
but knowing how messy men get when they 're not forced to sit down , the group has called for a ban on stehpinkeln , or peeing while standing , in the new his and hers toilets . german tabloid bild did n't wait long to take up the issue and surveyed berlin men about the proposal .
not one of them supported the idea and arguments ranged from fears of contracting diseases to disgust to seeing it as a waste of time . " men have been peeing standing up for several centuries , " 43-year-old ali , a scaffolder , told the paper .
" i 'm not going to let anyone take that away from me . " bernd meyer , a 16-year-old student , kept his calm , however .

the czech republic face greece in a clash of the dark horses and the minnows . with their free-flowing football and even freer-flowing hair , the czech republic are the dark horses with luscious manes that are taking the european championships by storm .
the only team to get to the semi-finals with a perfect record of four wins so far , the czechs are looking to maintain their momentum all the way to the final on sunday . however , what looks increasingly like one man 's unlikely destiny seems to stand between them and the henri delauney trophy .
that man is the greek god they call " rehhacles . " neither the czech republic nor otto rehhagel 's greece were among the favourites at the start of the tournament .
while the greeks were rank outsiders , the czechs were at least spoken of in hushed tones as the possible usurpers of the french throne .
as fate would have it , it was the greek team that put an end to that particular dynasty and set themselves for a battle against the czech republic . no complacency against greece , warns cech despite their record in the championships to date , the czech 's are preparing for thursday 's semi-final with the greeks as if they were taking on one of the big guns .
goalkeeper petr cech , the man who will act as the last defense , has warned his team against complacency when they face the team formerly known as the minnows of euro 2004 . " they are well organised , good in defence and not easy to score against , " cech told the team press conference after the czech republic ousted denmark 3-0 in their quarter-final .
" greece are quick on the break .
they are a dangerous team but i think we can beat them . " " we have played well at euro 2004 and in our country everyone is very happy with our performances . " midfield maestros while the czechs have caught the eye with their attacking flair , the creative midfield have been the driving force behind the tournament 's leading scorer milan baros and fellow striker jan koller .
tomas rosicky , one of the integral cogs in the midfield machine , expects greece to pose different problems than the denmark team he helped eliminate on sunday night . " it will be a much different game , " he said .
" they are defensively very good and play on the counter attack so we must be very careful .
denmark combined very well .
i thought they played well against us .
greece stay behind and play on counter attacks . " attacking flair in spades the czech republic scored three times in a 16-minute spell in the second-half of their match with denmark to seal their place in thursday 's semi-final in porto .
liverpool striker milan baros scored a double in the space of two minutes after jan koller had opened the scoring after a dismal first half where the czechs failed to bounce . the 22-year-old baros has been a revelation in portugal with five goals in four games and has struck up an awesome partnership with the giant koller and flourished from some excellent service provided by a brilliant midfield which boasts rosicky , karel poborsky and the luminous pavel nedved . " we are very effective at scoring goals , " rosicky told reporters .
" but we know that we can play much better .
i have played with milan at various levels in the national team since i was 14 and i know him very well .
we have two very good strikers in milan and jan koller .
when you have strikers like these it is easier for the rest of the team . " in addition to the abundance of attacking talent , the flamboyant czechs are also very well drilled at the back .
cech is a remarkable young goalkeeper while defensive midfielder tomas galasek superbly shields the back four when his more attacking colleagues go marauding forward .
the belief is there for this czech side to emulate the one that won the european title in 1976 . but they must first beat the greeks . greek warriors fear no-one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas seals the fate of the fading champions angelos charisteas , the werder bremen striker who home the second-half winner against reigning champions france to book the greeks a place in the last four , believes his side can reach the final after their sensational 1-0 over zidane , henry and team mates .
" anything can happen now .
we must try and play as well as we can and hope for the best , " said the current hero in a team full of them .
" but certainly the conditions are there for us to go further .
i 'm pleased to have scored but it 's more important we have got into the semi-finals . "
model of play fits to perfection his team mate trianos dellas admitted the greek 's surprise success in portugal was down to teamwork and preparation .
" the beauty of football is that things like this can always happen , " said defender dellas .
" the team played the game to perfection and we can only hope that we can produce more performances like this . "
greece coach otto rehhagel added : " we do not have brazilian or english characteristics so my job has been to produce a model that the greek players are comfortable with . "
the greeks will have stelios giannakopoulos available for selection after the midfielder recovered from a niggling calf injury which forced him out of the shock elimination of favourites france .
giannakopoulos should be fit for the semi-final and trained on sunday for the first time since limping out of greece 's draw with spain . influential midfielder set to return one of the coaching staff told reporters that his recovery was going well .
" the doctor told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time . " " on monday i will start playing with the team for the whole training session and i will be ready for the game , " giannakopoulos said .
" i am again playing with the ball , not just jogging , and the leg feels much better so i hope i will be fit to play . " " every game is tough but at this stage our dream has come true .
so now we are dreaming of the final and lifting the cup .
all four teams in the semi-finals will have an equal chance .
anything can happen now . " probable czech republic team : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , koller , baros .
probable greece team : nikopolidis , seitaridis , dellas , kapsis , fyssas , giannakopoulos , karagounis , zagorakis , katsouranis , charisteas , vryzas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : czechs crush danes to make semis playing defensively for most of the match , the czech republic surgically used their chances to beat denmark 3-0 on sunday .

among the new measures were cuts to pension rights , salaries and bonuses .
as part of the first rescue package , mitsubishi agreed to the loss of some 11,000 jobs , or 22 % of its global workforce .
it also would close manufacturing plants in japan and australia , while us factories would be reorganised .
since then , however , the company has had to recall even more vehicles , increasing the need for money , analysts said .

the pcsos powers include issuing fixed penalty tickets for minor anti-social behaviour and seizing vehicles .
pcsos , who wear distinctive , predominantly blue , uniforms , are already operating in the wells and somerton sectors and in other areas of the avon and somerset constabulary .
mr emery said : " the fact i am able to build on the work i have achieved as a parish warden in the area is great .
" the majority of the rural communities covered are very positive about my new role as they did not want to lose this community . "
inspector paul cox said : " the two parish warden posts are both being converted into pcsos and they will be operating on a similar basis as before in villages based in the frome sector .
" i have made an application to the home office for funding additional pcsos and hopefully the people of frome will be seeing more pcsos on their streets . "

the bill - enabling tolls to rise in line with inflation to fund other transport schemes - is due to receive the royal assent before the weekend .
