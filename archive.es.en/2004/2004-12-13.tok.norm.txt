jay , 19 and sentenced for driving without a license while on probation , agreed .
“ the project is good because it ’ s a change of pace for us , ” he said .
“ they teach us what we can do and learn artistically - and that ’ s lots of fun . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the pieces of artwork jointly created by pupils and inmates .
karin precker , the prisoners ’ class teacher , said she is often amazed at the inmates ’ high motivation .
“ it ’ s nice to see what comes out of it artistically , here in prison , a place you perceive as being very bleak , ” she said .
but you can tell that the young men also enjoy the girls ’ company .
“ we have good contact to the girls , ” daniel said .
and jay added they can talk about anything .
“ we talk about how it is , what reality is like , just like we would outside . “ an encounter with reality kunst im knast has been a huge success .
but getting the project going wasn ’ t easy .
according to fischer , convincing the school board , the prison authorities and , of course , the parents were great obstacles to overcome .
“ these students come from families whose parents are also judges and attorneys , so there were many doubts to resolve , ” said maringer .
it is precisely because of the girls ’ backgrounds that this experience is so important for them , as well .
“ it really helps them further in their personal development , ” fischer said .
“ it is a very significant realization for them to see that there are socially disadvantaged groups , there are youth , who have problems - basically , it ’ s reality .
for them to have very close contact to this reality is a valuable starting point . ”
" they are normal " carolin said the project has helped her overcome any prejudices she may have had .
“ i definitely think some of the guys look very strange and if i had met them on the street , i would have turned around and walked away as fast as i can , " she said .
" but here in jail , it ’ s a little bit different because i know nothing can happen to me and i ’ m safe .
so i can talk to anyone .
it ’ s no problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many locked doors at the siegburg facility .
still , sonja said it ’ s hard to forget what they ’ ve done .
but they ’ re still just regular guys .
“ yes , they have different thoughts , but they are normal , " she said .
" they are just youngsters like us and i think it ’ s very important to show them that we like them instead of what they ’ ve done . ”
the two-hour class is over quickly .
everyone cordially shakes hands .
“ bye , see you next week , ” they call to each other .
for the prisoners , it ’ s back to their everyday lives in the cellblock - until next week . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : young and thwarted international youth day aims to put the spotlight on the problems of young people and involve them in political decision-making .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "

the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2004 german innovation stalled at home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunications is not what it used to be internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .
that would be some € 35 million . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outrage at nazi labor camp compensation survivors of the nazi forced labor camps , their relatives and campaigning groups have labeled the german government 's offer of individual compensation as " derisive .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .

" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud .

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .

" i believe we 've done a lot to meet the highest political criteria for membership in the eu and that european leaders who will decide our future status on dec.16 will have in mind all our good moves , " prime minister ivo sanader said . the balkan country is pressing for a starting date of march or april next year and hopes to join the 25-nation bloc in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria , making it only the second former yugoslav republic after slovenia to join the club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader " positive arguments for croatia are too strong to be neglected , " sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- said , dismissing the negative argument commonly thrown at zagreb that it is failing to cooperate with the un war crimes court at the hague . failure to arrest war criminal delaying croatia 's accession to the eu because of its failure to arrest retired general ante gotovina - wanted for war crimes against ethnic serbs during the country 's 1991-1995 independence war - is " completely unacceptable , " he said . brussels has repeatedly called on zagreb to arrest gotovina but the fugitive remains a hero to many croatians and the government denies any knowledge of his whereabouts . the government is also struggling to convince europe that it is genuinely committed to other difficult membership criteria , namely the return of some 200,000 ethnic serb refugees . nose-diving support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb as the government remains fixated on the prize of eu membership , a survey in november showed nose-diving croatian public support for integration .
less than 50 percent of croatians now want to be part of the bloc , a massive plunge from 72.4 percent in january . " the fact that croatia is constantly facing the same demands has had a negative impact , notably among the population who suffered during the war , " a political analyst radovan vukadinovic told afp . " although legitimate , the demands by the hague court have eventually had a counter-productive effect , " he said .
" the ' carrot ' of eu membership seems to be more distant than it actually is . " ruse to delay membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian war crimes suspect ante gotovina he said people had come to the conclusion that the gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- case was merely an eu ruse to delay croatia 's membership . " they believe that even if the gotovina case is solved , brussels will find new conditions that croatia will have to meet , " vukadinovic said . the government has also failed to explain why croatia should join , he said . " they failed to show what are the advantages , how to deal with difficulties and why would croatia actually benefit from joining the eu , " he said . eu leaders have to decide the first draft of conclusions for the summit welcomes the progress croatia has made in preparation to kick off accession talks , but also calls on zagreb to detain gotovina . this leaves the question of a starting date for croatian accession talks open for eu leaders to decide at the summit . foreign ministry state secretary hidajet biscevic complained recently that since all traces of gotovina had vanished , croatia had been given a " mission impossible " by the eu . but at the same time he said that in the light of the approaching eu summit zagreb was aware that gotovina 's case " remains its obligation .

" i believe we 've done a lot to meet the highest political criteria for membership in the eu and that european leaders who will decide our future status on dec.16 will have in mind all our good moves , " prime minister ivo sanader said . the balkan country is pressing for a starting date of march or april next year and hopes to join the 25-nation bloc in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria , making it only the second former yugoslav republic after slovenia to join the club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader " positive arguments for croatia are too strong to be neglected , " sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- said , dismissing the negative argument commonly thrown at zagreb that it is failing to cooperate with the un war crimes court at the hague . failure to arrest war criminal delaying croatia 's accession to the eu because of its failure to arrest retired general ante gotovina - wanted for war crimes against ethnic serbs during the country 's 1991-1995 independence war - is " completely unacceptable , " he said . brussels has repeatedly called on zagreb to arrest gotovina but the fugitive remains a hero to many croatians and the government denies any knowledge of his whereabouts . the government is also struggling to convince europe that it is genuinely committed to other difficult membership criteria , namely the return of some 200,000 ethnic serb refugees . nose-diving support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb as the government remains fixated on the prize of eu membership , a survey in november showed nose-diving croatian public support for integration .
less than 50 percent of croatians now want to be part of the bloc , a massive plunge from 72.4 percent in january . " the fact that croatia is constantly facing the same demands has had a negative impact , notably among the population who suffered during the war , " a political analyst radovan vukadinovic told afp . " although legitimate , the demands by the hague court have eventually had a counter-productive effect , " he said .
" the ' carrot ' of eu membership seems to be more distant than it actually is . " ruse to delay membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian war crimes suspect ante gotovina he said people had come to the conclusion that the gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- case was merely an eu ruse to delay croatia 's membership . " they believe that even if the gotovina case is solved , brussels will find new conditions that croatia will have to meet , " vukadinovic said . the government has also failed to explain why croatia should join , he said . " they failed to show what are the advantages , how to deal with difficulties and why would croatia actually benefit from joining the eu , " he said . eu leaders have to decide the first draft of conclusions for the summit welcomes the progress croatia has made in preparation to kick off accession talks , but also calls on zagreb to detain gotovina . this leaves the question of a starting date for croatian accession talks open for eu leaders to decide at the summit . foreign ministry state secretary hidajet biscevic complained recently that since all traces of gotovina had vanished , croatia had been given a " mission impossible " by the eu . but at the same time he said that in the light of the approaching eu summit zagreb was aware that gotovina 's case " remains its obligation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2004 opposition candidate wins romania vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu 's supporters started celebrating sunday night traian basescu is the projected winner of romania 's presidential election , the central election commission said monday .
he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”

the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .

mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”

but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”

once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .

mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .

for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”

the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .

lidl , currently active in 19 countries , generates more than half of its sales outside germany , gehrig told the business daily handelsblatt , adding that the chain ’ s aim was to open stores in two new countries every year .
lidl 's sales are expected to rise this year by 11 percent to € 36 billion -lrb- $ 47.5 billion -rrb- , thanks largely to its successful international activities .
responding to the allegations about poor working conditions , gehrig said : " i can not rule out that isolated errors have occurred .
but there is no system “ of pressuring employees . ”
last friday , the german services sector labor union verdi slammed working conditions at lidl , saying that insufficient breaks and constant video surveillance of employees were creating a permanent " climate of fear " among the workforce . dw-world.de trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , has spoken out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .

while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

but the country ’ s rail operator still has a ways to go to please commuters . on sunday germany ’ s national rail operator , deutsche bahn , inaugurated a high-speed rail line connecting berlin to the northern port city of hamburg .
reaching a top speed of 230 kilometers -lrb- 143 miles -rrb- per hour , the journey between the two cities has been reduced by more than half an hour . with only 90 minutes of travel time separating the two popular destinations , deutsche bahn ’ s chief executive hartmut mehdorn proclaimed that hamburg was now a suburb of berlin and berlin was now within commuting distance of hamburg . but the jubilation among train travelers is likely to be muted .
on the same day the new line was launched , deutsche bahn announced it would be introducing a new round of painful ticket price increases . updating a historic stretch deutsche bahn has invested € 650 million -lrb- $ 858 million -rrb- on the modernization of the berlin-hamburg route that dates back to 1846 .
in the 1930s , the legendary flying hamburger needed just two hours and 18 minutes to complete the journey to berlin .
during the cold war and the division of germany , the trip could take as long as six hours .
it was cut back to two and half hours once german reunification had removed border controls and the track had been improved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn operates a high-speed rail connection between cologne and frankfurt , linking the cities in just 75 minutes .
deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .
a ticket now costs € 55 as opposed to the previous € 49 . german transport minister manfred stolpe said the new northern line is just the beginning in a longer development of upgrading rail lines .
frequently traveled connections from berlin to leipzig and berlin to warsaw also need to be modernized , he said . more passengers needed in order to attract more passengers for other routes as well as the berlin-hamburg line , deutsche bahn is considering selling tickets in supermarkets as well at stations and in travel agencies .
the rail operator is currently in talks with retailers and customers are being surveyed about what they think of the idea . whether tickets for german trains are sold at their traditional sales points or at more convenient locations , train travelers are saying the same thing : tickets are expensive .
the cost for long distance routes increased by 3.1 percent on sunday for the second time this year , and the cost for shorter journeys rose by a bit more than that . berlin 's governing mayor klaus wowereit has described the new hamburg-berlin line as an absolute alternative to the car .
it remains to be seen whether motorists agree with him , but as long as the cost for gas continues to rise , it may only be a question of which is the more convenient mode of transport . mark caldwell -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2004 nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been trying to allay fears about its nuclear program iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany . " the permanent suspension of enrichment is not on our agenda , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on the eve of the negotiations set to take place in brussels .
" we have agreed to a voluntary suspension for a short period .
a short-term freeze is what we are stressing . " the brussels talks are aimed at building on iran 's agreement to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment activities that have sparked fears the clerical regime is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons . over the coming months , the two sides will be trying to hammer out a long-term accord that includes " objective guarantees " iran will not develop the bomb and a package of incentives in return . this is to include the eu supporting iran 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , an eventual trade and cooperation agreement with the eu , addressing iran 's regional security concerns and sharing peaceful nuclear technology . deadline for talks in three months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan rowhani iran has pledged to maintain its nuclear fuel cycle freeze for the duration of the talks , but iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- also warned sunday that the islamic republic would abandon the discussions if no progress was being made . " we will continue the negotiations for as long as they are progressing , " rowhani told the official news agency irna before leaving for brussels , where he is due to meet the british , french and german foreign ministers in a steering committee conference on the sidelines of an eu ministerial gathering . " if at any point that our negotiations are not progressing , we will stop them .
the end of these three months of negotiations will indicate to us which point we have reached , " added the cleric , who heads iran 's supreme national security council . last month the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , decided against referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions after tehran agreed with the three eu states to suspend its uranium enrichment program . iran accepted the deal amid us threats to send the matter to the security council in new york .
washington alleges that the islamic republic is secretly developing nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran . a european source has said the iranians requested the first meeting of the steering committee - overseeing the working groups and the agreement - to be held at the ministerial level to give it " better visibility .

but the country ’ s rail operator still has a ways to go to please commuters . on sunday germany ’ s national rail operator , deutsche bahn , inaugurated a high-speed rail line connecting berlin to the northern port city of hamburg .
reaching a top speed of 230 kilometers -lrb- 143 miles -rrb- per hour , the journey between the two cities has been reduced by more than half an hour . with only 90 minutes of travel time separating the two popular destinations , deutsche bahn ’ s chief executive hartmut mehdorn proclaimed that hamburg was now a suburb of berlin and berlin was now within commuting distance of hamburg . but the jubilation among train travelers is likely to be muted .
on the same day the new line was launched , deutsche bahn announced it would be introducing a new round of painful ticket price increases . updating a historic stretch deutsche bahn has invested € 650 million -lrb- $ 858 million -rrb- on the modernization of the berlin-hamburg route that dates back to 1846 .
in the 1930s , the legendary flying hamburger needed just two hours and 18 minutes to complete the journey to berlin .
during the cold war and the division of germany , the trip could take as long as six hours .
it was cut back to two and half hours once german reunification had removed border controls and the track had been improved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn operates a high-speed rail connection between cologne and frankfurt , linking the cities in just 75 minutes .
deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .
a ticket now costs € 55 as opposed to the previous € 49 . german transport minister manfred stolpe said the new northern line is just the beginning in a longer development of upgrading rail lines .
frequently traveled connections from berlin to leipzig and berlin to warsaw also need to be modernized , he said . more passengers needed in order to attract more passengers for other routes as well as the berlin-hamburg line , deutsche bahn is considering selling tickets in supermarkets as well at stations and in travel agencies .
the rail operator is currently in talks with retailers and customers are being surveyed about what they think of the idea . whether tickets for german trains are sold at their traditional sales points or at more convenient locations , train travelers are saying the same thing : tickets are expensive .
the cost for long distance routes increased by 3.1 percent on sunday for the second time this year , and the cost for shorter journeys rose by a bit more than that . berlin 's governing mayor klaus wowereit has described the new hamburg-berlin line as an absolute alternative to the car .
it remains to be seen whether motorists agree with him , but as long as the cost for gas continues to rise , it may only be a question of which is the more convenient mode of transport . mark caldwell -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”

after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .

for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”

the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2004 opposition candidate wins romania vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu 's supporters started celebrating sunday night traian basescu is the projected winner of romania 's presidential election , the central election commission said monday .
he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu .

" the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

it was a close shave , but after a lot of mud , sweat and tears , they emerged with the honorary title of winter champions . vfb stuttgart had what looked like an insurmountable 2-0 lead going into the game 's last 25 minutes , but bayern munich went on to tie the game 2-2 and claim its 13th lead going into the winter break - it 's gone on to win the german championship 11 of the past 12 times it held the half-season lead .
stuttgart opened the scoring in the 29th minute when silvio meissner put in the first half 's only goal , a fitting half-time result as stuttgart kept control during the first 45 minutes .
twenty minutes into the second half stuttgart struck again .
this time it was forward kevin kuranyi who tapped the ball home unopposed after german national team goalie oliver kahn fumbled and gave up an easy rebound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defender mathieu delpierre , right , goes for a header with munich 's striker roy makaay but whatever bayern coach felix magath told his players in the locker room had an effect .
even down by two goals , they were the more aggressive side in the second half .
not many scoring chances in a match that seldom moved out of midfield , there were few good chances on goal and no truly outstanding individual players for either side .
it was bayern 's claudio pizarro who brought munich back into the match when he scored in the 67th minute .
then with only two minutes left in the game , paulo guerrero tied the game for the bavarians , and put an end to stuttgart manager matthias sammer 's hope of winning in munich - something he has n't been able to do as a player or coach .
the tie keeps bayern three point ahead of third place stuttgart and ahead of second place schalke 04 on goal difference , both teams have 34 points going into the six-week winter hiatus .
vfl wolfsburg makes a comeback on sunday wolfsburg notched up a monumental 5-0 home win over arminia bielefeld , jumping back up to fourth place in the bundesliga as a result .
thomas rytter got the ball rolling when he scored the opening goal just 14 minutes into play .
by half-time diego klimowicz had netted a header and thomas brdaric had scored twice , putting them 4-0 ahead .
martin petrov got the fifth from the penalty spot in the 67th minute .
the win came as a massive boost for wolfsburg who had slipped down to seventh place after a run of three successive league defeats .
in the other sunday match , bayer leverkusen drew 1-1 away to borussia moenchengladbach .
freiburg holds schalke to a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's mike hanke knows his team 's 1-1 tie is n't enough to move into first place schalke could have nudged bayern from top spot but were left cursing a late lapse in concentration after a 1-1 home draw against bottom side sc freiburg .
schalke led for 86 minutes thanks to mladen krstajic 's 24th minute header , but lebanese international roda antar struck with four minutes remaining to grab a share of the spoils .
this time last season werder bremen was tops , before going on to lift the german crown , this winter break they remain in fourth place and six points adrift of leaders .
a 1-1 tie was the best werder could do at home against kaiserlautern .
ivan klasnic scored for last year 's champs and carsten jancker put the ball in for 9th place kaiserlautern .
in the middle of the table an early goal from markus schroth was enough for 12th place nuremberg to take a 1-0 win against mainz . one point is all that seperates nuremberg from their rivals this weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael -lrb- left -rrb- fights for the ball with hanover 's steve cherundolo hertha berlin won a tough 1-0 game against hanover 96 on a goal from nando rafael .
both teams are tied on points , but berlin 's better goal difference puts it in a fifth place and a comfortable spot in the table 's top third .
three goals come in hamburg hamburg took three points from bochum thanks to first half goals from sergej barbarez and colin benjamin .
bochum 's tommy bechmann scored in the game 's dying minutes , a goal that looked good on the scoreboard but does n't help bochum get out of 16th place .
in the fight against relegation , borussia dortmund failed to advance with a 1-1 draw at fellow strugglers hansa rostock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock player marcus allbaeck -lrb- rear -rrb- and borussia dortmund player sebastian kehl challenge for the ball dortmund 's sebastian kehl took advantage of a lucky deflection in the 40th minute to bring his team level with hansa , which took the lead after swedish international markus allback headed hansa ahead in the 32nd minute .

jay , 19 and sentenced for driving without a license while on probation , agreed .
“ the project is good because it ’ s a change of pace for us , ” he said .
“ they teach us what we can do and learn artistically - and that ’ s lots of fun . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the pieces of artwork jointly created by pupils and inmates .
karin precker , the prisoners ’ class teacher , said she is often amazed at the inmates ’ high motivation .
“ it ’ s nice to see what comes out of it artistically , here in prison , a place you perceive as being very bleak , ” she said .
but you can tell that the young men also enjoy the girls ’ company .
“ we have good contact to the girls , ” daniel said .
and jay added they can talk about anything .
“ we talk about how it is , what reality is like , just like we would outside . “ an encounter with reality kunst im knast has been a huge success .
but getting the project going wasn ’ t easy .
according to fischer , convincing the school board , the prison authorities and , of course , the parents were great obstacles to overcome .
“ these students come from families whose parents are also judges and attorneys , so there were many doubts to resolve , ” said maringer .
it is precisely because of the girls ’ backgrounds that this experience is so important for them , as well .
“ it really helps them further in their personal development , ” fischer said .
“ it is a very significant realization for them to see that there are socially disadvantaged groups , there are youth , who have problems - basically , it ’ s reality .
for them to have very close contact to this reality is a valuable starting point . ”
" they are normal " carolin said the project has helped her overcome any prejudices she may have had .
“ i definitely think some of the guys look very strange and if i had met them on the street , i would have turned around and walked away as fast as i can , " she said .
" but here in jail , it ’ s a little bit different because i know nothing can happen to me and i ’ m safe .
so i can talk to anyone .
it ’ s no problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many locked doors at the siegburg facility .
still , sonja said it ’ s hard to forget what they ’ ve done .
but they ’ re still just regular guys .
“ yes , they have different thoughts , but they are normal , " she said .
" they are just youngsters like us and i think it ’ s very important to show them that we like them instead of what they ’ ve done . ”
the two-hour class is over quickly .
everyone cordially shakes hands .
“ bye , see you next week , ” they call to each other .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .

it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

" i believe we 've done a lot to meet the highest political criteria for membership in the eu and that european leaders who will decide our future status on dec.16 will have in mind all our good moves , " prime minister ivo sanader said . the balkan country is pressing for a starting date of march or april next year and hopes to join the 25-nation bloc in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria , making it only the second former yugoslav republic after slovenia to join the club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivo sanader " positive arguments for croatia are too strong to be neglected , " sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- said , dismissing the negative argument commonly thrown at zagreb that it is failing to cooperate with the un war crimes court at the hague . failure to arrest war criminal delaying croatia 's accession to the eu because of its failure to arrest retired general ante gotovina - wanted for war crimes against ethnic serbs during the country 's 1991-1995 independence war - is " completely unacceptable , " he said . brussels has repeatedly called on zagreb to arrest gotovina but the fugitive remains a hero to many croatians and the government denies any knowledge of his whereabouts . the government is also struggling to convince europe that it is genuinely committed to other difficult membership criteria , namely the return of some 200,000 ethnic serb refugees . nose-diving support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral square in croatia 's capital , zagreb as the government remains fixated on the prize of eu membership , a survey in november showed nose-diving croatian public support for integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2004 opposition candidate wins romania vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu 's supporters started celebrating sunday night traian basescu is the projected winner of romania 's presidential election , the central election commission said monday .
he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .

the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .

" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .

but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud .

it was a close shave , but after a lot of mud , sweat and tears , they emerged with the honorary title of winter champions . vfb stuttgart had what looked like an insurmountable 2-0 lead going into the game 's last 25 minutes , but bayern munich went on to tie the game 2-2 and claim its 13th lead going into the winter break - it 's gone on to win the german championship 11 of the past 12 times it held the half-season lead .
stuttgart opened the scoring in the 29th minute when silvio meissner put in the first half 's only goal , a fitting half-time result as stuttgart kept control during the first 45 minutes .
twenty minutes into the second half stuttgart struck again .
this time it was forward kevin kuranyi who tapped the ball home unopposed after german national team goalie oliver kahn fumbled and gave up an easy rebound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defender mathieu delpierre , right , goes for a header with munich 's striker roy makaay but whatever bayern coach felix magath told his players in the locker room had an effect .
even down by two goals , they were the more aggressive side in the second half .
not many scoring chances in a match that seldom moved out of midfield , there were few good chances on goal and no truly outstanding individual players for either side .
it was bayern 's claudio pizarro who brought munich back into the match when he scored in the 67th minute .
then with only two minutes left in the game , paulo guerrero tied the game for the bavarians , and put an end to stuttgart manager matthias sammer 's hope of winning in munich - something he has n't been able to do as a player or coach .
the tie keeps bayern three point ahead of third place stuttgart and ahead of second place schalke 04 on goal difference , both teams have 34 points going into the six-week winter hiatus .
vfl wolfsburg makes a comeback on sunday wolfsburg notched up a monumental 5-0 home win over arminia bielefeld , jumping back up to fourth place in the bundesliga as a result .
thomas rytter got the ball rolling when he scored the opening goal just 14 minutes into play .
by half-time diego klimowicz had netted a header and thomas brdaric had scored twice , putting them 4-0 ahead .
martin petrov got the fifth from the penalty spot in the 67th minute .
the win came as a massive boost for wolfsburg who had slipped down to seventh place after a run of three successive league defeats .
in the other sunday match , bayer leverkusen drew 1-1 away to borussia moenchengladbach .
freiburg holds schalke to a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's mike hanke knows his team 's 1-1 tie is n't enough to move into first place schalke could have nudged bayern from top spot but were left cursing a late lapse in concentration after a 1-1 home draw against bottom side sc freiburg .
schalke led for 86 minutes thanks to mladen krstajic 's 24th minute header , but lebanese international roda antar struck with four minutes remaining to grab a share of the spoils .
this time last season werder bremen was tops , before going on to lift the german crown , this winter break they remain in fourth place and six points adrift of leaders .
a 1-1 tie was the best werder could do at home against kaiserlautern .
ivan klasnic scored for last year 's champs and carsten jancker put the ball in for 9th place kaiserlautern .
in the middle of the table an early goal from markus schroth was enough for 12th place nuremberg to take a 1-0 win against mainz . one point is all that seperates nuremberg from their rivals this weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael -lrb- left -rrb- fights for the ball with hanover 's steve cherundolo hertha berlin won a tough 1-0 game against hanover 96 on a goal from nando rafael .
both teams are tied on points , but berlin 's better goal difference puts it in a fifth place and a comfortable spot in the table 's top third .
three goals come in hamburg hamburg took three points from bochum thanks to first half goals from sergej barbarez and colin benjamin .
bochum 's tommy bechmann scored in the game 's dying minutes , a goal that looked good on the scoreboard but does n't help bochum get out of 16th place .
in the fight against relegation , borussia dortmund failed to advance with a 1-1 draw at fellow strugglers hansa rostock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock player marcus allbaeck -lrb- rear -rrb- and borussia dortmund player sebastian kehl challenge for the ball dortmund 's sebastian kehl took advantage of a lucky deflection in the 40th minute to bring his team level with hansa , which took the lead after swedish international markus allback headed hansa ahead in the 32nd minute .
hansa had lost all eight of their home matches in the league but broke that luckless sequence with a point against dortmund . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms , tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 'll head into the break on top ?

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2004 opposition candidate wins romania vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu 's supporters started celebrating sunday night traian basescu is the projected winner of romania 's presidential election , the central election commission said monday .
he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .

" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home .

it was cut back to two and half hours once german reunification had removed border controls and the track had been improved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn operates a high-speed rail connection between cologne and frankfurt , linking the cities in just 75 minutes .
deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .
a ticket now costs € 55 as opposed to the previous € 49 . german transport minister manfred stolpe said the new northern line is just the beginning in a longer development of upgrading rail lines .
frequently traveled connections from berlin to leipzig and berlin to warsaw also need to be modernized , he said . more passengers needed in order to attract more passengers for other routes as well as the berlin-hamburg line , deutsche bahn is considering selling tickets in supermarkets as well at stations and in travel agencies .
the rail operator is currently in talks with retailers and customers are being surveyed about what they think of the idea . whether tickets for german trains are sold at their traditional sales points or at more convenient locations , train travelers are saying the same thing : tickets are expensive .
the cost for long distance routes increased by 3.1 percent on sunday for the second time this year , and the cost for shorter journeys rose by a bit more than that . berlin 's governing mayor klaus wowereit has described the new hamburg-berlin line as an absolute alternative to the car .
it remains to be seen whether motorists agree with him , but as long as the cost for gas continues to rise , it may only be a question of which is the more convenient mode of transport . mark caldwell -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

tour buses deposit visitors at the toy museum , which traces the former miners ' gradual transformation of seiffen into a christmas kitsch mecca over the last four centuries . at the glässer studio , tourists watched a group of women dressed in flowered aprons put the finishing touches on nutcrackers donning traditional bavarian dress . " they love them in the united states - the americans think all germans run around like this , " hübsch told his guests . showing how lovingly the trinkets are made also helps sales , of course . " people understand better why we ask the prices we do , " hübsch said . astounding growth seiffen has come a long way since its miner town days .
in communist east germany , all the artisans were grouped in collectives from 1972 and essentially only produced decorations for export at a time when the east german regime was heavily dependent on foreign currency . since reunification in 1990 , six hotels have gone up , much of the village has been refurbished and tourists have been pouring in - albeit overwhelmingly during the christmas season . bildunterschrift : seiffen during the christmas season " we have seen astounding growth , " mayor schreiter said .
" there was a lot of ground to make up . " with the fall of the wall , the artisans reclaimed control of their businesses . " it has n't been easy , " said matthias schalling , who relaunched a firm founded in 1904 by his great-grandfather .
" we had to reinvent ourselves and find new clients . " no second las vegas one of the most pressing concerns of the artisans is to maintain the training program for " making wooden toys " - a specific apprenticeship offered by the local vocational college . this year , some 20 apprentices graduated from the three-year program .
but in the new germany , the program that enjoyed official recognition by the communist authorities is facing the axe .
there is also an encroaching commercialization on their centuries-old craft . schreiter said he aimed to ensure that seiffen did not turn into " a kind of las vegas . " " we are trying to put a stop to anything that goes too far , " said glässer 's hübsch - starting with garish colored garlands .

" the permanent suspension of enrichment is not on our agenda , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on the eve of the negotiations set to take place in brussels .
" we have agreed to a voluntary suspension for a short period .
a short-term freeze is what we are stressing . " the brussels talks are aimed at building on iran 's agreement to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment activities that have sparked fears the clerical regime is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons . over the coming months , the two sides will be trying to hammer out a long-term accord that includes " objective guarantees " iran will not develop the bomb and a package of incentives in return . this is to include the eu supporting iran 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , an eventual trade and cooperation agreement with the eu , addressing iran 's regional security concerns and sharing peaceful nuclear technology . deadline for talks in three months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan rowhani iran has pledged to maintain its nuclear fuel cycle freeze for the duration of the talks , but iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- also warned sunday that the islamic republic would abandon the discussions if no progress was being made . " we will continue the negotiations for as long as they are progressing , " rowhani told the official news agency irna before leaving for brussels , where he is due to meet the british , french and german foreign ministers in a steering committee conference on the sidelines of an eu ministerial gathering . " if at any point that our negotiations are not progressing , we will stop them .
the end of these three months of negotiations will indicate to us which point we have reached , " added the cleric , who heads iran 's supreme national security council . last month the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , decided against referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions after tehran agreed with the three eu states to suspend its uranium enrichment program . iran accepted the deal amid us threats to send the matter to the security council in new york .
washington alleges that the islamic republic is secretly developing nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran . a european source has said the iranians requested the first meeting of the steering committee - overseeing the working groups and the agreement - to be held at the ministerial level to give it " better visibility . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana is also likely to attend monday 's session . enrichment main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at iran 's isfahan nuclear facility enrichment has been and remains at the heart of the stand-off over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to produce fuel for a series of atomic power stations it has yet to build .
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- permits enrichment for peaceful purposes . but there are fears that once the nuclear fuel cycle has been mastered by iran , the country could choose to quit the npt and enrich uranium to weapons grade . the eu-3 have been seeking to engage iran in a bid to get the country to renounce its fuel cycle work altogether , something iran has so far refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran european diplomats also say that their diplomatic effort is only guaranteed of a success if the united states , which has no diplomatic relations with iran , joins the talks in some capacity and offers iran the security guarantees it is after . but according to a report in the new york times , us national security adviser and secretary of state designate condoleezza rice has not been convinced of a need to change us policy towards iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea adopts resolution on iran the un atomic agency adopted on monday a toned-down resolution on iran 's nuclear program after tehran agreed to a total freeze on all enrichment activities .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

jay , 19 and sentenced for driving without a license while on probation , agreed .
“ the project is good because it ’ s a change of pace for us , ” he said .
“ they teach us what we can do and learn artistically - and that ’ s lots of fun . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the pieces of artwork jointly created by pupils and inmates .
karin precker , the prisoners ’ class teacher , said she is often amazed at the inmates ’ high motivation .
“ it ’ s nice to see what comes out of it artistically , here in prison , a place you perceive as being very bleak , ” she said .
but you can tell that the young men also enjoy the girls ’ company .
“ we have good contact to the girls , ” daniel said .
and jay added they can talk about anything .
“ we talk about how it is , what reality is like , just like we would outside . “ an encounter with reality kunst im knast has been a huge success .
but getting the project going wasn ’ t easy .
according to fischer , convincing the school board , the prison authorities and , of course , the parents were great obstacles to overcome .
“ these students come from families whose parents are also judges and attorneys , so there were many doubts to resolve , ” said maringer .
it is precisely because of the girls ’ backgrounds that this experience is so important for them , as well .
“ it really helps them further in their personal development , ” fischer said .
“ it is a very significant realization for them to see that there are socially disadvantaged groups , there are youth , who have problems - basically , it ’ s reality .
for them to have very close contact to this reality is a valuable starting point . ”
" they are normal " carolin said the project has helped her overcome any prejudices she may have had .
“ i definitely think some of the guys look very strange and if i had met them on the street , i would have turned around and walked away as fast as i can , " she said .
" but here in jail , it ’ s a little bit different because i know nothing can happen to me and i ’ m safe .
so i can talk to anyone .
it ’ s no problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many locked doors at the siegburg facility .
still , sonja said it ’ s hard to forget what they ’ ve done .
but they ’ re still just regular guys .
“ yes , they have different thoughts , but they are normal , " she said .
" they are just youngsters like us and i think it ’ s very important to show them that we like them instead of what they ’ ve done . ”
the two-hour class is over quickly .
everyone cordially shakes hands .
“ bye , see you next week , ” they call to each other .

but the country ’ s rail operator still has a ways to go to please commuters . on sunday germany ’ s national rail operator , deutsche bahn , inaugurated a high-speed rail line connecting berlin to the northern port city of hamburg .
reaching a top speed of 230 kilometers -lrb- 143 miles -rrb- per hour , the journey between the two cities has been reduced by more than half an hour . with only 90 minutes of travel time separating the two popular destinations , deutsche bahn ’ s chief executive hartmut mehdorn proclaimed that hamburg was now a suburb of berlin and berlin was now within commuting distance of hamburg . but the jubilation among train travelers is likely to be muted .
on the same day the new line was launched , deutsche bahn announced it would be introducing a new round of painful ticket price increases . updating a historic stretch deutsche bahn has invested € 650 million -lrb- $ 858 million -rrb- on the modernization of the berlin-hamburg route that dates back to 1846 .
in the 1930s , the legendary flying hamburger needed just two hours and 18 minutes to complete the journey to berlin .
during the cold war and the division of germany , the trip could take as long as six hours .
it was cut back to two and half hours once german reunification had removed border controls and the track had been improved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn operates a high-speed rail connection between cologne and frankfurt , linking the cities in just 75 minutes .
deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .
a ticket now costs € 55 as opposed to the previous € 49 . german transport minister manfred stolpe said the new northern line is just the beginning in a longer development of upgrading rail lines .
frequently traveled connections from berlin to leipzig and berlin to warsaw also need to be modernized , he said . more passengers needed in order to attract more passengers for other routes as well as the berlin-hamburg line , deutsche bahn is considering selling tickets in supermarkets as well at stations and in travel agencies .
the rail operator is currently in talks with retailers and customers are being surveyed about what they think of the idea . whether tickets for german trains are sold at their traditional sales points or at more convenient locations , train travelers are saying the same thing : tickets are expensive .
the cost for long distance routes increased by 3.1 percent on sunday for the second time this year , and the cost for shorter journeys rose by a bit more than that . berlin 's governing mayor klaus wowereit has described the new hamburg-berlin line as an absolute alternative to the car .
it remains to be seen whether motorists agree with him , but as long as the cost for gas continues to rise , it may only be a question of which is the more convenient mode of transport . mark caldwell -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2004 german innovation stalled at home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunications is not what it used to be internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

" christmas keeps our town going , " mayor wolfgang schreiter said of seiffen , nestled in the erzgebirge -lrb- ore mountains -rrb- near the czech border .
" it 's our trump card . " with a jobless rate of just 5 percent , seiffen is an economic oasis in a region where 15 to 25 percent of the workforce is on the dole . in the heat of each summer , the yuletide operations in this town of 2,800 denizens grind into gear .
hundreds of small craft shops , most of them family-owned , begin production with male wood-turners shaping decorations and women adding the finishing details with tiny paintbrushes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant christmas figures and a typical christmas pyramid outside a seiffen store decorations from seiffen include wooden figurines which would grace any christmas tree , but there are also a dizzying array of candlesticks , nutcrackers and incense-holders bound for export to other european countries , the united states and japan . one of the biggest companies in town , glässer , has 130 employees and now posts 20 percent of its turnover abroad , said managing director klaus hübsch . tourism boom in the run-up to dec .
24 , some 200,000 tourists descend on the quaint open-air christmas market .
tour buses deposit visitors at the toy museum , which traces the former miners ' gradual transformation of seiffen into a christmas kitsch mecca over the last four centuries . at the glässer studio , tourists watched a group of women dressed in flowered aprons put the finishing touches on nutcrackers donning traditional bavarian dress . " they love them in the united states - the americans think all germans run around like this , " hübsch told his guests . showing how lovingly the trinkets are made also helps sales , of course . " people understand better why we ask the prices we do , " hübsch said . astounding growth seiffen has come a long way since its miner town days .
in communist east germany , all the artisans were grouped in collectives from 1972 and essentially only produced decorations for export at a time when the east german regime was heavily dependent on foreign currency . since reunification in 1990 , six hotels have gone up , much of the village has been refurbished and tourists have been pouring in - albeit overwhelmingly during the christmas season . bildunterschrift : seiffen during the christmas season " we have seen astounding growth , " mayor schreiter said .
" there was a lot of ground to make up . " with the fall of the wall , the artisans reclaimed control of their businesses . " it has n't been easy , " said matthias schalling , who relaunched a firm founded in 1904 by his great-grandfather .
" we had to reinvent ourselves and find new clients . " no second las vegas one of the most pressing concerns of the artisans is to maintain the training program for " making wooden toys " - a specific apprenticeship offered by the local vocational college . this year , some 20 apprentices graduated from the three-year program .
but in the new germany , the program that enjoyed official recognition by the communist authorities is facing the axe .
there is also an encroaching commercialization on their centuries-old craft . schreiter said he aimed to ensure that seiffen did not turn into " a kind of las vegas . " " we are trying to put a stop to anything that goes too far , " said glässer 's hübsch - starting with garish colored garlands .
white lights - and wooden handmade decorations - are more faithful to the true spirit of christmas , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six centuries of sweet success steeped in tradition and dusted with icing sugar , the stollen is the king of german christmas cakes .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .
romania 's main civil rights group , pro democratia , lamented the move saying " thousands of people had begun queueing in front of the voting stations opened for people who were far from home . " to avoid people voting more than once , the central electoral bureau decided to limit to 70 the number of voting stations for those who found themselves away from home . the turnout in sunday 's election stood at around 53 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de round two in romanian presidential ballot these are important days for the future of romania .

these planned reforms , which have to be approved by parliament , would see germany 's states pay a part of any fines received under the stability pact .
a fine is the ultimate punishment meted out under the pact for failure to adhere to its rules of maintaining a budget deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany has violated the pact three years in a row .
according to the financial times deutschland newspaper , the federal government would have to pay 65 percent of the fines , while the 16 states would have to pay the remaining 35 percent .
the agreement came after several months of cross-party negotiation which finally allowed the federalism commission on sunday to announce a deal .
the proposals concerning the stability pact are part of wider constitutional reform in germany .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

but the country ’ s rail operator still has a ways to go to please commuters . on sunday germany ’ s national rail operator , deutsche bahn , inaugurated a high-speed rail line connecting berlin to the northern port city of hamburg .
reaching a top speed of 230 kilometers -lrb- 143 miles -rrb- per hour , the journey between the two cities has been reduced by more than half an hour . with only 90 minutes of travel time separating the two popular destinations , deutsche bahn ’ s chief executive hartmut mehdorn proclaimed that hamburg was now a suburb of berlin and berlin was now within commuting distance of hamburg . but the jubilation among train travelers is likely to be muted .
on the same day the new line was launched , deutsche bahn announced it would be introducing a new round of painful ticket price increases . updating a historic stretch deutsche bahn has invested € 650 million -lrb- $ 858 million -rrb- on the modernization of the berlin-hamburg route that dates back to 1846 .
in the 1930s , the legendary flying hamburger needed just two hours and 18 minutes to complete the journey to berlin .

deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .
a ticket now costs € 55 as opposed to the previous € 49 . german transport minister manfred stolpe said the new northern line is just the beginning in a longer development of upgrading rail lines .
frequently traveled connections from berlin to leipzig and berlin to warsaw also need to be modernized , he said . more passengers needed in order to attract more passengers for other routes as well as the berlin-hamburg line , deutsche bahn is considering selling tickets in supermarkets as well at stations and in travel agencies .
the rail operator is currently in talks with retailers and customers are being surveyed about what they think of the idea . whether tickets for german trains are sold at their traditional sales points or at more convenient locations , train travelers are saying the same thing : tickets are expensive .
the cost for long distance routes increased by 3.1 percent on sunday for the second time this year , and the cost for shorter journeys rose by a bit more than that . berlin 's governing mayor klaus wowereit has described the new hamburg-berlin line as an absolute alternative to the car .

deutsche börse , the company which operates the frankfurt stock exchange , announced that it had offered to buy the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- for around € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- .
the lse rejected the offer as too low , but indicated that it was prepared to continue negotiations with frankfurt with a view to securing a " significantly " higher offering price .
analysts suggested that euronext , which comprises the paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon stock exchanges , was waiting in the sidelines and might launch a counter bid for the lse , which would thwart frankfurt and london 's dreams of a tie-up . more briefs 12.12.2004 -pipe- germans unmask online pirates 11.12.2004 -pipe- commerzbank eyes postbank 11.12.2004 -pipe- report : eu drops charges against germany 11.12.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler probed over illegal sales 10.12.2004 -pipe- airbus to launch a350 to rival boeing 7e7 10.12.2004 -pipe- continental to leave russia , cut 1,000 jobs 10.12.2004 -pipe- german carmakers see rising sales in 2005 10.12.2004 -pipe- eads employees suspected of bribe-taking radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2004 nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been trying to allay fears about its nuclear program iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany . " the permanent suspension of enrichment is not on our agenda , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on the eve of the negotiations set to take place in brussels .
" we have agreed to a voluntary suspension for a short period .
a short-term freeze is what we are stressing . " the brussels talks are aimed at building on iran 's agreement to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment activities that have sparked fears the clerical regime is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons . over the coming months , the two sides will be trying to hammer out a long-term accord that includes " objective guarantees " iran will not develop the bomb and a package of incentives in return . this is to include the eu supporting iran 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , an eventual trade and cooperation agreement with the eu , addressing iran 's regional security concerns and sharing peaceful nuclear technology . deadline for talks in three months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan rowhani iran has pledged to maintain its nuclear fuel cycle freeze for the duration of the talks , but iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- also warned sunday that the islamic republic would abandon the discussions if no progress was being made . " we will continue the negotiations for as long as they are progressing , " rowhani told the official news agency irna before leaving for brussels , where he is due to meet the british , french and german foreign ministers in a steering committee conference on the sidelines of an eu ministerial gathering . " if at any point that our negotiations are not progressing , we will stop them .
the end of these three months of negotiations will indicate to us which point we have reached , " added the cleric , who heads iran 's supreme national security council . last month the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , decided against referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions after tehran agreed with the three eu states to suspend its uranium enrichment program . iran accepted the deal amid us threats to send the matter to the security council in new york .
washington alleges that the islamic republic is secretly developing nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran . a european source has said the iranians requested the first meeting of the steering committee - overseeing the working groups and the agreement - to be held at the ministerial level to give it " better visibility . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana is also likely to attend monday 's session . enrichment main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at iran 's isfahan nuclear facility enrichment has been and remains at the heart of the stand-off over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to produce fuel for a series of atomic power stations it has yet to build .
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- permits enrichment for peaceful purposes . but there are fears that once the nuclear fuel cycle has been mastered by iran , the country could choose to quit the npt and enrich uranium to weapons grade . the eu-3 have been seeking to engage iran in a bid to get the country to renounce its fuel cycle work altogether , something iran has so far refused to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran european diplomats also say that their diplomatic effort is only guaranteed of a success if the united states , which has no diplomatic relations with iran , joins the talks in some capacity and offers iran the security guarantees it is after . but according to a report in the new york times , us national security adviser and secretary of state designate condoleezza rice has not been convinced of a need to change us policy towards iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea adopts resolution on iran the un atomic agency adopted on monday a toned-down resolution on iran 's nuclear program after tehran agreed to a total freeze on all enrichment activities .

it was a close shave , but after a lot of mud , sweat and tears , they emerged with the honorary title of winter champions . vfb stuttgart had what looked like an insurmountable 2-0 lead going into the game 's last 25 minutes , but bayern munich went on to tie the game 2-2 and claim its 13th lead going into the winter break - it 's gone on to win the german championship 11 of the past 12 times it held the half-season lead .
stuttgart opened the scoring in the 29th minute when silvio meissner put in the first half 's only goal , a fitting half-time result as stuttgart kept control during the first 45 minutes .
twenty minutes into the second half stuttgart struck again .
this time it was forward kevin kuranyi who tapped the ball home unopposed after german national team goalie oliver kahn fumbled and gave up an easy rebound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defender mathieu delpierre , right , goes for a header with munich 's striker roy makaay but whatever bayern coach felix magath told his players in the locker room had an effect .
even down by two goals , they were the more aggressive side in the second half .
not many scoring chances in a match that seldom moved out of midfield , there were few good chances on goal and no truly outstanding individual players for either side .
it was bayern 's claudio pizarro who brought munich back into the match when he scored in the 67th minute .
then with only two minutes left in the game , paulo guerrero tied the game for the bavarians , and put an end to stuttgart manager matthias sammer 's hope of winning in munich - something he has n't been able to do as a player or coach .
the tie keeps bayern three point ahead of third place stuttgart and ahead of second place schalke 04 on goal difference , both teams have 34 points going into the six-week winter hiatus .
vfl wolfsburg makes a comeback on sunday wolfsburg notched up a monumental 5-0 home win over arminia bielefeld , jumping back up to fourth place in the bundesliga as a result .
thomas rytter got the ball rolling when he scored the opening goal just 14 minutes into play .
by half-time diego klimowicz had netted a header and thomas brdaric had scored twice , putting them 4-0 ahead .
martin petrov got the fifth from the penalty spot in the 67th minute .
the win came as a massive boost for wolfsburg who had slipped down to seventh place after a run of three successive league defeats .
in the other sunday match , bayer leverkusen drew 1-1 away to borussia moenchengladbach .
freiburg holds schalke to a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's mike hanke knows his team 's 1-1 tie is n't enough to move into first place schalke could have nudged bayern from top spot but were left cursing a late lapse in concentration after a 1-1 home draw against bottom side sc freiburg .
schalke led for 86 minutes thanks to mladen krstajic 's 24th minute header , but lebanese international roda antar struck with four minutes remaining to grab a share of the spoils .
this time last season werder bremen was tops , before going on to lift the german crown , this winter break they remain in fourth place and six points adrift of leaders .
a 1-1 tie was the best werder could do at home against kaiserlautern .
ivan klasnic scored for last year 's champs and carsten jancker put the ball in for 9th place kaiserlautern .
in the middle of the table an early goal from markus schroth was enough for 12th place nuremberg to take a 1-0 win against mainz . one point is all that seperates nuremberg from their rivals this weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael -lrb- left -rrb- fights for the ball with hanover 's steve cherundolo hertha berlin won a tough 1-0 game against hanover 96 on a goal from nando rafael .
both teams are tied on points , but berlin 's better goal difference puts it in a fifth place and a comfortable spot in the table 's top third .
three goals come in hamburg hamburg took three points from bochum thanks to first half goals from sergej barbarez and colin benjamin .
bochum 's tommy bechmann scored in the game 's dying minutes , a goal that looked good on the scoreboard but does n't help bochum get out of 16th place .
in the fight against relegation , borussia dortmund failed to advance with a 1-1 draw at fellow strugglers hansa rostock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock player marcus allbaeck -lrb- rear -rrb- and borussia dortmund player sebastian kehl challenge for the ball dortmund 's sebastian kehl took advantage of a lucky deflection in the 40th minute to bring his team level with hansa , which took the lead after swedish international markus allback headed hansa ahead in the 32nd minute .
hansa had lost all eight of their home matches in the league but broke that luckless sequence with a point against dortmund . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms , tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 'll head into the break on top ?

lidl , currently active in 19 countries , generates more than half of its sales outside germany , gehrig told the business daily handelsblatt , adding that the chain ’ s aim was to open stores in two new countries every year .
lidl 's sales are expected to rise this year by 11 percent to € 36 billion -lrb- $ 47.5 billion -rrb- , thanks largely to its successful international activities .
responding to the allegations about poor working conditions , gehrig said : " i can not rule out that isolated errors have occurred .
but there is no system “ of pressuring employees . ”
last friday , the german services sector labor union verdi slammed working conditions at lidl , saying that insufficient breaks and constant video surveillance of employees were creating a permanent " climate of fear " among the workforce . dw-world.de trade union boss reproaches " oppressive " discount stores frank bsirske , the chairman of german trade union verdi , has spoken out publicly against three of germany 's biggest discount retailers and criticized their working conditions and perceived lack of employee rights .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .

but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu .

he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .

but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2004 opposition candidate wins romania vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu 's supporters started celebrating sunday night traian basescu is the projected winner of romania 's presidential election , the central election commission said monday .
he hopes to lead his country into the eu . with 51.23 percent the vote on monday , the romanian election commission projected opposition candidate traian basescu the winner of romania 's cliffhanger presidential election .
voters were kept waiting though the night for the results , as exit polls on sunday , the day of the election , proved too close to call . but on monday morning , the election commission made it official : basescu trimphed over his opponent , prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- psd -rrb- , after 92 percent of ballots were counted .
basescu has thus been charged with the task of pushing through the democratic reforms needed to make romania 's dream of joining the european union in 2007 a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu : from the bucharest mayorship to the romanian presidency the presidential race ended in a tie sunday , exit polls showed a few hours after voting ended .
the curs institute initially gave nastase a narrow lead over basescu with 50.7 percent of the votes when polls closed in the former communist state at 8:00 p.m. it then revised its tally , saying it concurred with another poll , carried out by the insomar institute , which gave each candidate 50 percent of vote .
the suspense continued through the night as romania 's central electoral bureau said the first official results from the presidential race would only be published on monday morning . cries of foul-play nastase had been the clear favorite to succeed long-serving president ion iliescu , but analysts said that a flurry of last-minute voting in bucharest could hand basescu , who is the mayor of the capital , an upset victory . basescu cried foul after losing the first round on nov .
28 to nastase , but on sunday night he told supporters he was confident that vote counting would proceed in a proper fashion .
" i am confident that the state 's institutions will do their job properly and that each vote will be counted .
i assure romanians that their vote will be respected , " he said at his party 's headquarters . nastase , who heads the ruling social democrat party , had come out ahead in the first round after taking 41 percent of the vote compared to basescu 's 34 percent . hopes for eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing prime minister adrian nastase the outgoing prime minister , a rather aloof and authoritarian figure , projected himself as iliescu 's natural successor and the man who would assure romania 's smooth accession to the eu in 2007 basescu , a sailor-turned-politician , also presented himself as pro-european but built his campaign on promises to rid romania of rampant corruption , which he laid at the door of nastase 's government . nastase was given a big boost on wednesday when bucharest signed a deal sealing the end of romania 's eu accession talks .
but basescu 's justice and truth alliance said the closure of accession talks was " premature , " as " romania could not objectively fulfil the conditions laid down by the eu . " under the deal , romania 's membership , scheduled for january 2007 , could be put off for a year if it does not fulfill its obligations to reduce state aid to the steel sector , clamp down on corruption and bolster controls at what will be the eu 's eastern border . preventing fraud sunday 's vote took place with some 3,300 independent observers in place after the opposition and several non-governmental organizations said the first round was marred by " massive fraud . " the electoral commission rapidly shut down 10 additional voting stations that were opened by the bucharest municipality , saying they were illegal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2004 train speeds up hamburg-berlin commute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg to berlin in 90 minutes at 230 km / h the launch of a high-speed rail connection between berlin and hamburg reduces the journey between germany ’ s two biggest cities to 90 minutes .
but the country ’ s rail operator still has a ways to go to please commuters . on sunday germany ’ s national rail operator , deutsche bahn , inaugurated a high-speed rail line connecting berlin to the northern port city of hamburg .
reaching a top speed of 230 kilometers -lrb- 143 miles -rrb- per hour , the journey between the two cities has been reduced by more than half an hour . with only 90 minutes of travel time separating the two popular destinations , deutsche bahn ’ s chief executive hartmut mehdorn proclaimed that hamburg was now a suburb of berlin and berlin was now within commuting distance of hamburg . but the jubilation among train travelers is likely to be muted .
on the same day the new line was launched , deutsche bahn announced it would be introducing a new round of painful ticket price increases . updating a historic stretch deutsche bahn has invested € 650 million -lrb- $ 858 million -rrb- on the modernization of the berlin-hamburg route that dates back to 1846 .
in the 1930s , the legendary flying hamburger needed just two hours and 18 minutes to complete the journey to berlin .
during the cold war and the division of germany , the trip could take as long as six hours .
it was cut back to two and half hours once german reunification had removed border controls and the track had been improved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn operates a high-speed rail connection between cologne and frankfurt , linking the cities in just 75 minutes .
deutsche bahn has said it hopes its new , faster line will attract a further 400,000 passengers a year , luring them away from their cars and air travel .
but a faster hamburg berlin train route is also a more expensive one .

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .
that would be some € 35 million . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outrage at nazi labor camp compensation survivors of the nazi forced labor camps , their relatives and campaigning groups have labeled the german government 's offer of individual compensation as " derisive .

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

"
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .

meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .

it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”

the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .

mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

jay , 19 and sentenced for driving without a license while on probation , agreed .
“ the project is good because it ’ s a change of pace for us , ” he said .
“ they teach us what we can do and learn artistically - and that ’ s lots of fun . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the pieces of artwork jointly created by pupils and inmates .
karin precker , the prisoners ’ class teacher , said she is often amazed at the inmates ’ high motivation .
“ it ’ s nice to see what comes out of it artistically , here in prison , a place you perceive as being very bleak , ” she said .
but you can tell that the young men also enjoy the girls ’ company .
“ we have good contact to the girls , ” daniel said .
and jay added they can talk about anything .
“ we talk about how it is , what reality is like , just like we would outside . “ an encounter with reality kunst im knast has been a huge success .
but getting the project going wasn ’ t easy .
according to fischer , convincing the school board , the prison authorities and , of course , the parents were great obstacles to overcome .
“ these students come from families whose parents are also judges and attorneys , so there were many doubts to resolve , ” said maringer .
it is precisely because of the girls ’ backgrounds that this experience is so important for them , as well .
“ it really helps them further in their personal development , ” fischer said .
“ it is a very significant realization for them to see that there are socially disadvantaged groups , there are youth , who have problems - basically , it ’ s reality .
for them to have very close contact to this reality is a valuable starting point . ”
" they are normal " carolin said the project has helped her overcome any prejudices she may have had .
“ i definitely think some of the guys look very strange and if i had met them on the street , i would have turned around and walked away as fast as i can , " she said .
" but here in jail , it ’ s a little bit different because i know nothing can happen to me and i ’ m safe .
so i can talk to anyone .
it ’ s no problem . ”

“ yes , they have different thoughts , but they are normal , " she said .
" they are just youngsters like us and i think it ’ s very important to show them that we like them instead of what they ’ ve done . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

both sides profit from the meetings . teenagers hover around various works of art , discussing whether to add a touch of color here or what title to give the piece .
another group takes a hammer , breaking their painting in half to insert a second level to the work .
it could be any classroom .
except this one has bars on the windows .
for over a decade , students from the paul-klee-gymnasium in overath have been coming to the correctional facility in siegburg each school year for joint art class with young male prisoners .
carolin , an 11th grader and one of the dozen girls participating in the voluntary project , admitted she was somewhat nervous the first time they came to the prison .
“ i didn ’ t know what would happen here , ” she said .
but now , this had changed .
“ i think it ’ s a great experience to be here in jail . ”
for the young men , the project kunst im knast or “ art in the slammer ” means a lot .
they anxiously await the two-hour lesson every week .
“ the consumption of aftershave is very high prior to these visits , ” said the prison ’ s recreation coordinator , walter maringer .
“ everyone wants to make a good impression .
but the young women have understood to behave in such a way that the prisoners do not have all-too high expectations . ”
prison politeness those prisoners not participating in the program , however , behave in a more stereotypical manner .
after crossing through several locked doors , the girls from the paul-klee-gymnasium enter a courtyard with their two teachers .
here , they are greeted with catcalls from these other young men , standing at the barred windows of their cells .
for sonja , this reception threw her off the first time .
she said she actually had n't been nervous about participating in the program .
her sister had also taken part two years earlier and told her that she needn ’ t be afraid .
“ but when they yelled at us when we came into the courtyard , i thought , oh , should i really go in there ? ”
sonja said .
“ but now it ’ s normal .
you go there and it ’ s just , yeah , they ’ re screaming - whatever . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each prisoner has his own cell .
once you enter the school wing , the prison feeling dissipates .
the inmates have painted colorful murals on the walls , brightening up the space between the individual cells .
the young men stand at the door to the classroom , well-groomed and very polite , offering the girls a handshake in welcome .
with all this civility , you would think this was a church gathering .
the journey is the reward georg fischer , the teacher who heads the project , said the prisoners are quite withdrawn at the beginning of the school year .
but then they slowly opened up to the girls , as carolin recalled .
“ when we first came here , they didn ’ t want to talk to us , ” she said .
“ now , it has changed .
when we arrive here , they ’ re very friendly and happy to see us .
it ’ s great ! ”
the young men are making up their intermediate school education .
mehdi , a 21-year-old in prison for theft , said the project is interesting and exciting for him .
“ for me , it ’ s a social exchange and can maybe help me for my life after jail , “ he said .
the contact to the girls , who mainly come from good families , is important for the inmates in this respect . “ here , they can have close contact to integrated youth without them being presented to them as role models , ” fischer said .
“ they can see that there are other possibilities in our society to come to grips with something , not just with violence .
or when they deal with their girlfriends the next time , maybe they won ’ t be the big machos any longer . ”
for maringer , this is an important step .
“ many prisoners have learned that you don ’ t only have to talk about girls using vulgar language .
in many cases , the journey is the reward , efforts are made to encounter each other without bias and that has actually succeeded . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2004 german innovation stalled at home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunications is not what it used to be internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance . until recently , the invention of the cell phone was the biggest advance in personal communications since alexander graham bell invented the analog telephone .
twenty years ago , it seemed almost impossible to imagine that mobile phones , which would soon be available in ever shrinking varieties , would make most people reachable almost anywhere in the world - at a cost . but new technology , so-called internet calling services , or voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- as it is called in the business , is set to challenge both traditional analog and cellular services .
the reason is simple : it 's cheap , cutting the cost of a call to next to nothing per minute .
experts estimate voip phones will soon make traditional phones a relic of the past . but while this forward-thinking technology was " made in germany , " it has been slow to catch on at home .
in this particular case , germany has both lived up to its reputation as a country committed to developing cutting-edge technology and a place where innovation is hampered by excessive amounts of regulation and the fear of change . berlin birthplace of internet calling voice over internat protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- allows people to make telephone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular or analog phone line .
voip converts the voice signal from a telephone into a digital signal that travels over the internet before it is converted back at the other end so people can speak to anyone who has a regular phone number . the technology was the brainchild of german-born henning schulzrinne , who first thought of it while on an exchange to columbia university in 1992 .
as they say , necessity was the mother of invention , and the cash-strapped schulzrinne was looking for a cheap way to stay in touch with his family in germany . upon returning home , he further experimented with internet calling at berlin 's fokus institut , eventually developing a protocol known as sip , which has become the basis for most internet calling services around the world . news of schulzrinne 's discovery was soon picked up by large american communication giants like at & t , lucent and mci .
in britain , bt expressed an interest in adopting internet calling . germany sits out tech revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice over internet protocol changes the way telefoning takes place .
meanwhile , henning 's advance was widely greeted with suspicion in germany .
communications companies like telekom feared losing out on long distance profits to start-up internet service providers .
while foreign phone companies were looking for ways to develop void services to their own benefit , german companies took a more obstructionist approach . the german government and its communication regulatory agency have done little to smooth the way .
for one , they have not taken action to force service providers like telekom to " de-bundle " telephone and internet services .
until now , those who want to have a high-speed dsl internet line , which is needed for voip calling , are forced to have it bundled - i.e. part of a package of services - with a traditional phone line . experts fear a repeat of the mp3 fiasco , the technology for which was also developed in germany , although german firms did not develop lucrative business applications for it .
similar resistance to digital music means that most germans who buy and download music online use foreign services , like itunes , with german online music platforms struggling to catch up . internet calling could prove to be another missed opportunity . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .

" christmas keeps our town going , " mayor wolfgang schreiter said of seiffen , nestled in the erzgebirge -lrb- ore mountains -rrb- near the czech border .
" it 's our trump card . " with a jobless rate of just 5 percent , seiffen is an economic oasis in a region where 15 to 25 percent of the workforce is on the dole . in the heat of each summer , the yuletide operations in this town of 2,800 denizens grind into gear .
hundreds of small craft shops , most of them family-owned , begin production with male wood-turners shaping decorations and women adding the finishing details with tiny paintbrushes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant christmas figures and a typical christmas pyramid outside a seiffen store decorations from seiffen include wooden figurines which would grace any christmas tree , but there are also a dizzying array of candlesticks , nutcrackers and incense-holders bound for export to other european countries , the united states and japan . one of the biggest companies in town , glässer , has 130 employees and now posts 20 percent of its turnover abroad , said managing director klaus hübsch . tourism boom in the run-up to dec .
24 , some 200,000 tourists descend on the quaint open-air christmas market .
tour buses deposit visitors at the toy museum , which traces the former miners ' gradual transformation of seiffen into a christmas kitsch mecca over the last four centuries . at the glässer studio , tourists watched a group of women dressed in flowered aprons put the finishing touches on nutcrackers donning traditional bavarian dress . " they love them in the united states - the americans think all germans run around like this , " hübsch told his guests . showing how lovingly the trinkets are made also helps sales , of course . " people understand better why we ask the prices we do , " hübsch said . astounding growth seiffen has come a long way since its miner town days .
in communist east germany , all the artisans were grouped in collectives from 1972 and essentially only produced decorations for export at a time when the east german regime was heavily dependent on foreign currency . since reunification in 1990 , six hotels have gone up , much of the village has been refurbished and tourists have been pouring in - albeit overwhelmingly during the christmas season . bildunterschrift : seiffen during the christmas season " we have seen astounding growth , " mayor schreiter said .
" there was a lot of ground to make up . " with the fall of the wall , the artisans reclaimed control of their businesses . " it has n't been easy , " said matthias schalling , who relaunched a firm founded in 1904 by his great-grandfather .
" we had to reinvent ourselves and find new clients . " no second las vegas one of the most pressing concerns of the artisans is to maintain the training program for " making wooden toys " - a specific apprenticeship offered by the local vocational college . this year , some 20 apprentices graduated from the three-year program .
but in the new germany , the program that enjoyed official recognition by the communist authorities is facing the axe .
there is also an encroaching commercialization on their centuries-old craft . schreiter said he aimed to ensure that seiffen did not turn into " a kind of las vegas . " " we are trying to put a stop to anything that goes too far , " said glässer 's hübsch - starting with garish colored garlands .

the first is a triangle of land , called the lenné dreieck , with an estimated value of some € 145 million -lrb- $ 192 million -rrb- , which is now the site of an exclusive center housing luxury offices and hotels .
on thursday , an administrative court ruled that heirs with a claim to former property at the site , could legally file for compensation .
lawyer matthias druba , who represents the heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains , told the berliner zeitung daily that compensation could n't " come fast enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive hotels contribute to the new face of the disputed site but exactly who any such financial reparation would come from is not yet clear .
the history of the site is as manifold as the buildings which now sit upon it . whilst berlin sold much of the land at the start of the 1990s , it returned the largest single plot to hertie , the legal successor to the former owners , the wertheim family , in the hope that hertie would erect a central office there . but hertie , which was subsequently taken over by karstadtquelle later sold the land . druba said it is now up to the state of berlin and the karstadtquelle department store chain , to agree on compensation payments .
he told reporters that as the successor to hertie , the karstadtquelle concern could be accountable to meet claims of former land owners . karstadtquelle has so far failed to comment . the wertheim legacy the wertheim family owned large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , including a second site which is now home to the marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-elisabeth-lueders-haus is home to the new library the building accommodates the new german parliamentary library and is as such something of a contentious issue .
when it was opened last year , bundestag president wolfgang thierse told the wertheim heirs that justified reparation claims would be recognized and treated fairly . but matthias druba told the berliner zeitung newspaper that thus far , his clients have only been offered 15 percent of the value of the plot . however , the berliner zeitung has written that the federal office for the settlement of open property issues is planning to recognize the wertheim claim for the waterside site . druba described it as " disgusting " that the process is taking so long and said the federal government should pay out compensation to the value of the site at the time that building began there .

the royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- found that 28 % did not take a break because they were too busy at work .
the 2003 new earnings survey from the national office of statistics appeared to support the claim .
it showed that britons worked some of the longest hours in europe - about 40 hours a week .

according to the survey , the picture was even bleaker uk-wide , with a third of britons not taking their full amount of annual leave this year and three quarters -lrb- 78 % -rrb- blaming long working hours .
allan hardie , from the rbs 's royalties premier account , said : " it is a sad state of affairs that simple lack of planning is resulting in so much unused annual leave , especially around this time of year when families want to spend time with their loved ones .
" of course our lives are so busy and we live in a 24-hour society , but this means it 's all the more important to make sure we use our holiday wisely . "

authorities say the checks are the first of their kind and aim to cut the number of drug-affected motorists dying on the roads .
around 9,000 drivers are expected to be screened during the year-long trial .
a third of drivers killed on the state 's roads last year tested positive to drugs other than alcohol , according to victoria 's police minister .
victoria 's police minister , andre haermeyer , said the roadside checks were a world first .
they will target people who have used cannabis and methamphetamines at nightclubs and dance parties .
truck drivers who take drugs - usually methamphetamines - to stay awake will also face scrutiny .
a media officer at victoria police , sheree argento , said these two drugs were being focused on because " obviously , they are the two most accessible drugs , and the two that people are most likely to take and then drive " .
test process the test involves asking drivers to place a small absorbent pad on their tongues for a few seconds .
the screening of saliva will not detect prescription drugs or medication such as cold or flu tablets .
drivers testing positive will then be required to give a second sample , which will be sent to a laboratory .
those found to have used illegal substances will be fined and could lose their licence .
ms argento said that 32 drivers were tested on the first day of the screening on monday .
twenty-two of these were truck drivers .
one man tested positive , although it is not known which drug this was for .
he was given a fine of a $ 300 and three demerit points .
ms argento said the tested drivers all complied with the procedure .
she said they knew what to expect because of publicity about the scheme ahead of its launch .
an australian survey recently revealed that one in four men under the age of 25 said they had driven a car after taking an illegal drug .
the tests could soon be extended to other parts of australia .
police in new south wales are expected to begin a 12-month trial next year , along with similar roadside checks in tasmania .

authorities say the checks are the first of their kind and aim to cut the number of drug-affected motorists dying on the roads .
around 9,000 drivers are expected to be screened during the year-long trial .
a third of drivers killed on the state 's roads last year tested positive to drugs other than alcohol , according to victoria 's police minister .
victoria 's police minister , andre haermeyer , said the roadside checks were a world first .
they will target people who have used cannabis and methamphetamines at nightclubs and dance parties .
truck drivers who take drugs - usually methamphetamines - to stay awake will also face scrutiny .
a media officer at victoria police , sheree argento , said these two drugs were being focused on because " obviously , they are the two most accessible drugs , and the two that people are most likely to take and then drive " .
test process the test involves asking drivers to place a small absorbent pad on their tongues for a few seconds .
the screening of saliva will not detect prescription drugs or medication such as cold or flu tablets .
drivers testing positive will then be required to give a second sample , which will be sent to a laboratory .
those found to have used illegal substances will be fined and could lose their licence .
ms argento said that 32 drivers were tested on the first day of the screening on monday .
twenty-two of these were truck drivers .

"
in a series where we talk to leading health experts , bbc news online meets dr beverly malone .
as general secretary , royal college of nursing she is responsible for the leadership of the largest professional association and trade union for over 375,000 nurses in the uk .
dr malone explains how her training as a nurse and a clinical psychologist have armed her for a career in health politics .
dr malone 's cv at school , what did you want to be when you grew up ?
favourite film anything with bette davis in , and the film cabin in the sky i joined the future nurses club and then became an assistant , like a health care assistant , in the local hospital .
it was voluntary work .
from there i went on to do a university programme for nursing .
it 's always been a passion .
i really could n't imagine being anything else other than a nurse .
being a nurse totally consumed me .
i am also a clinical psychologist so i actually am more than a nurse .
what first got you interested in what you do now ?
my great-grandmother was a healer in the community .
we lived in a very rural area of kentucky in the segregated deep south .
it was a black community .
idol my great-grandmother she was such a strong woman and yet at the same time very compassionate and caring .
she just took care of people .
she was sort of the healthcare resident , so i grew up knowing about different herbs and medicines that could heal .
i was her scout .
she would take me into the woods and she would say ' pick this ' and ' pick that ' .
i would n't know what i was picking , and then she would make it into a medicines .
what are the major issues or challenges in your field of interest at the moment ?
to make sure that patients get what they need in this changing community .
everything is in such a state of flux , patients are more expert than they have every been and the system is more disparate .
person who changed your life my faith in jesus christ , in the lord .
i think i would be horrible if i was n't religious .
getting the right staff with the right patients and giving the right service is a really important piece of the challenges that are ahead .
i think the whole issue is around public health - people managing not only their own illnesses but their health and actually how to stay out of hospital .
my thought is that eventually , when babies are born , those little name tags round their wrists will have a dna map and it 's going to say that x and y and z is likely to happen and the whole goal will be to keep those things from happening .
nurses will be translators to help patients and families understand how to manage their health .
what worries keep you awake at night ?
if i 'm awake it means i 'm sick .
pet hates torture , to see children harmed , sexual abuse , physical abuse and war .
i have never been one to worry .
i just do n't do that .
there are things that are very sad like the war in iraq .
but i do n't tend to take those things to bed with me .
what do you regret ?
i did not have enough children .
i only had two .
annoying habit opinionated and self-satisfied .
it 's not that i 'm perfect , it 's really about feeling that i have got enough .
i would have liked to have had four or five because they are so delightful .
they are so incredibly wonderful .
i just feel they are the best part of me .
they are the best thing i have ever done with my life .
what would you have done if you had n't gone in to this ?
the other thing is politics .
i do have a taste for it .
but for me , it sits with my career as a nurse so it 's not changing my role it 's just extending it .
ca n't live without faith if i 've got my faith i can accomplish anything i need to accomplish .
i was an intern for a senator for hawaii and just fell in love with politics .
i had a knack for it .
all of my wonderful psychiatric skills , they just were so transferable it was great .
and being a nurse we are taught how to complete things .
we are used to managing more than 15 things at a time and when you are working in politics all of those skills come in handy .

now he is a familiar figure across the area - and many see him as a potential future palestinian leader , despite his sentence of five life terms he is currently serving in an israeli jail .
for the moment , he has been forced to change his mind and withdraw his candidacy to succeed yasser arafat - supporting mahmoud abbas as the choice of their mainstream fatah movement .
when the palestinian uprising broke out in 2000 , he led marches to israeli checkpoints , where riots broke out against israeli soldiers .
he spurred on palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations , condoning the use of force to expel israel from the west bank and gaza strip .
he gained the increasing support of the palestinian " street " while the more established leaders - close arafat allies mahmoud abbas and ahmed qurei - were seen as part of the old guard .
fate sealed marwan barghouti was arrested in april 2002 and first appeared in court the following august - charged with the killing of 26 people and belonging to a terrorist organisation .
the leader of arafat 's fatah movement in the west bank , he has been closely identified with one of its militant offshoots , the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade .
the brigade possibly sealed his fate when it issued a statement in 2002 claiming him as its leader . "
marwan barghouti has always identified with the grass-roots rather than the leadership " abdel bari atwan al-quds newspaper editor the group has carried out numerous operations against israeli soldiers and settlers in the west bank and gaza , and suicide attacks on civilians inside israel .
but marwan barghouti has denied founding al-aqsa but has hailed some operations by the group , which has also attacked israeli military targets .
throughout his trial , he refused to recognise the legitimacy of the israeli court .
insisting he was an elected member of the palestinian legislative council , his lawyers tried to turn his trial into a trial of israel and its occupation of the palestinian territories .
ultimately he was convicted for murder over the deaths of four israelis and a greek monk , as there was insufficient evidence connecting him to the other 21 .
record of resistance he has been jailed before , and was deported to jordan , for his role in organising the 1987-92 uprising , while arafat and his coterie were exiled in tunisia .
he returned during the oslo peace process , gaining respect among palestinians for his scepticism about israel 's commitment to successive land-for-peace deals .
few members of the first intifada leadership were prominent in arafat 's administration but marwan barghouti , who first became politically active at bir zeit university , is one of a handful to have moved ahead .
in 1996 , he was elected to the palestinian legislative council with overwhelming support .
he launched a campaign against human rights abuses by arafat 's own security services and corruption among his officials .
" marwan barghouti has always identified with the grass-roots rather than the leadership , " says abdel bari atwan , editor of the influential pan-arabic newspaper al-quds .
suited to negotiations " his star really came into its ascendancy after he spoke out against the palestinian authority leadership . "
while rejecting the oslo peace process , he has spoken against attacks on civilians inside israel , and after his conviction he insisted that suicide attacks were " not correct " .
even from his prison cell , he has continued to play an important role as a political figure .
he helped negotiate a unilateral truce declared by the main palestinian militant groups in june 2003 - temporarily easing attacks against israelis .
that truce collapsed two months later , following a palestinian suicide bombing and an israeli air strike that killed a hamas political leader .
if israel ever agreed to negotiate with marwan barghouti he could make use of his hebrew , which he mastered during a previous prison term .
he also speaks fluent english .
he also reportedly counts left-wing israelis among his friends .

he gained the increasing support of the palestinian " street " while the more established leaders - close arafat allies mahmoud abbas and ahmed qurei - were seen as part of the old guard .
fate sealed marwan barghouti was arrested in april 2002 and first appeared in court the following august - charged with the killing of 26 people and belonging to a terrorist organisation .
the leader of arafat 's fatah movement in the west bank , he has been closely identified with one of its militant offshoots , the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade .
the brigade possibly sealed his fate when it issued a statement in 2002 claiming him as its leader .
marwan barghouti has always identified with the grass-roots rather than the leadership abdel bari atwan al-quds newspaper editor the group has carried out numerous operations against israeli soldiers and settlers in the west bank and gaza , and suicide attacks on civilians inside israel .
but marwan barghouti has denied founding al-aqsa but has hailed some operations by the group , which has also attacked israeli military targets .
throughout his trial , he refused to recognise the legitimacy of the israeli court .
insisting he was an elected member of the palestinian legislative council , his lawyers tried to turn his trial into a trial of israel and its occupation of the palestinian territories .
ultimately he was convicted for murder over the deaths of four israelis and a greek monk , as there was insufficient evidence connecting him to the other 21 .
record of resistance he has been jailed before , and was deported to jordan , for his role in organising the 1987-92 uprising , while arafat and his coterie were exiled in tunisia .
he returned during the oslo peace process , gaining respect among palestinians for his scepticism about israel 's commitment to successive land-for-peace deals .
barghouti says israel tried to assassinate him few members of the first intifada leadership were prominent in arafat 's administration but marwan barghouti , who first became politically active at bir zeit university , is one of a handful to have moved ahead .
in 1996 , he was elected to the palestinian legislative council with overwhelming support .
he launched a campaign against human rights abuses by arafat 's own security services and corruption among his officials .
" marwan barghouti has always identified with the grass-roots rather than the leadership , " says abdel bari atwan , editor of the influential pan-arabic newspaper al-quds .
suited to negotiations " his star really came into its ascendancy after he spoke out against the palestinian authority leadership . "
while rejecting the oslo peace process , he has spoken against attacks on civilians inside israel , and after his conviction he insisted that suicide attacks were " not correct " .
even from his prison cell , he has continued to play an important role as a political figure .
he helped negotiate a unilateral truce declared by the main palestinian militant groups in june 2003 - temporarily easing attacks against israelis .
that truce collapsed two months later , following a palestinian suicide bombing and an israeli air strike that killed a hamas political leader .
if israel ever agreed to negotiate with marwan barghouti he could make use of his hebrew , which he mastered during a previous prison term .
he also speaks fluent english .
he also reportedly counts left-wing israelis among his friends .

the scheme entitled otar , overseas trade re-skilling , has been developed to help refugees gain the necessary qualifications to work .
one estimate suggests that 27,000 skilled workers are needed to help meet current demand .
it is the idea of an umbrella group , new roots scotland .
the group is made up of glasgow city council , unions , colleges , construction companies and the institute of contemporary scotland .
industry leaders are hoping to employ refugees to ease a skills shortage brought about by scotland 's falling population .
the building industry is being hit by scotland 's falling population however , problems are caused because although many refugees have professional skills , they do not correspond to uk qualifications .
council director of building services william docherty said : " the people have skills that the city is crying out for , we 'll take them up to a certain level and put them back into the city to work .
" the participants in this scheme are all skilled craftspersons in their own countries , we 'll take them up to the required level within scottish building regulations and the legislative standards in terms of health and safety to put them back into the industry . "
the recruitment drive has also been developed to allow refugees to improve their english , particularly technical language , and translate their overseas qualifications into the uk equivalents .
new roots ' boss maggie lennon said a pilot scheme proved so successful , it could be adapted to offer new skills to scots with little experience of the construction industry .
she told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " although at the moment it is aimed at refugees , there is potential to take the same approach to retraining and re-skilling available to all sorts of people .
" and that might include people in the uk who have , for whatever reason , left the construction industry and want back in . "

sir elton was told by a throat specialist he would be " foolish " to go ahead with the concert , the fourth scheduled date of his british tour .
the singer said he was " sorry to disappoint " his fans , who have been promised refunds for their tickets .
he added that he looked forward to seeing his glasgow fans next june , when another concert is scheduled at the city 's scottish exhibition and conference centre -lrb- secc -rrb- .
fans have also been told that their tickets from sunday night 's concert will be valid at the summer date . '
no voice ' sir elton is due to perform four dates at london 's hammersmith apollo this week , and organisers are still hopeful that he will be well enough to sing .
the pop star explained ahead of friday 's shelved concert in nottingham that his voice was suffering .
" i seem to have caught this infection only yesterday , and my voice started to go during last night 's show .
" i woke up this morning with virtually no voice , " he said .
sir elton has a hectic schedule of concerts planned for the first half of next year , including a us tour .
he will play 10 dates in las vegas , as part of the 75-show deal with the colosseum at caesar 's palace he signed last year .
the chart-topper is scheduled for his next appearances there in february .

with only one in three uk restaurants surviving beyond two years , getting the menu right is only one part of the battle for would-be restaurateurs .
add the rent or mortgage , business and water rates , wages for staff , vat , and refurbishment costs , and whether or not the sauce goes well with the fish could be the least of your worries .
but the public remains undeterred : opening a cafe or restaurant is among the most cherished ambitions of jaded mid-career wage slaves .
so what advice do successful restaurateurs have for would-be gordon ramseys ?
no free lunch " research everything as thoroughly as possible , " says robin couling , co-owner and chef at the falcon inn , an award-winning pub and restaurant in the gloucestershire village of poulton .
is your menu priced correctly ?
" a lot of people have a romantic idea of running a pub or restaurant .
they expect it to be a nice lifestyle change from a 9 to 5 job , but in reality , it is a lot of hard work . "
for mr couling , the most important thing to realise is that you have to commit your complete life to it .
" you are not going to succeed if you do n't give it your all .
i know that sounds a bit obvious , but to be successful it will take up all your time . "
food for thought this opinion is completely shared by huw fowler , founder and owner of hamburger union , an upmarket hamburger diner which has two outlets in central london .
" if you think you can be an absentee owner and the business will survive , you are completely mistaken , " he says .
" when we opened the first restaurant i was on the till myself and doing 16-hour days for the first three months .
" you have to be completely hands-on . "
paying the bill but even if you have the commitment and drive , the next hurdle to face is finding start-up cash .
even the best restaurant can fail if it is in the wrong location huw fowler as a general rule , think carefully about how much money you will need - and then double it .
" you need to be much more capitalised than you think , as cash flow can be tight to start with , " said mr couling .
" owning a restaurant is not an easy way to make money .
" you only have to look at the failure rate to see that . "
for mr fowler , cash flow is particularly pertinent because with one restaurant in soho and another in covent garden , he is paying among the highest rents in the uk .
" rent is a huge problem ... we 've got to make £ 200,000 a year before we can even open the doors . "
seating plan to make money , hamburger union needs a lot of bums on seats .
burgers can be upmarket these days but as mr fowler says , any restaurant 's business plan must never be over-ambitious about the projected " plate count " or number of diners .
" you need to be very conservative with your projections , " he says .
" and if you beat them , then that 's great . "
cafe society one crucial factor here is where you locate .
" even the best restaurant can fail if it is in the wrong location , " says mr fowler .
central london obviously offers a great many potential customers ; the outer hebrides , for example , rather fewer .
on the other hand , the rents are far lower in rural scotland .
ingredients of success the next factor is which suppliers to choose .
" having a good long term relationship with your supplier is vital , " says mr fowler .
" a lot of businesses make the mistake of going with the cheapest , but someone more expensive may not only provide better ingredients , but also a better service .
" and always , always pay on time .
" you need to look after your supplier , so that if - heaven forbid - you ever find yourself in a tight squeeze , they will be much more willing to help out . "
service charge so , you have the cash , you have the menu , you have the perfect location , the next factor is staffing .
how many staff do you need and how much will you pay them ?
" you can fall down if you skimp on staff training , " says mr fowler .
" they are your customer 's first impression , and bad staff is a real turn-off . "
with so many hurdles to jump , it makes you wonder why anyone wants to go into the restaurant market .
the reason it remains so popular is simple , says mr couling , " get it right and it is very rewarding . "
" the sense of personal satisfaction is very high . "

reports of the absolute monarch 's latest purchase contrast with accounts of suffering in swaziland , which has the highest aids rate in the world .
the maybach car has a television , dvd player , 21-speaker surround-sound system , fridge , cordless telephone and sterling silver champagne flutes .
the 36-year-old king frequently hits the headlines with stories about his lavish lifestyle .
in april this year , 10,000 guests celebrated his 36th birthday at an event estimated to have cost $ 600,000 , prompting widespread criticism from those who said the country could ill-afford to host such an event .
swaziland 's unemployment rate stands at 40 % while almost 70 % of the country 's one-million population live on an average daily income of $ 1 or less .
about one third of all swaziland 's people rely on food aid for survival .
elite group " we feel great that the king of swaziland has chosen our product , this shows that our product has arrived .
this kind of car is the super high end of the luxury segment , " daimlerchrysler south africa 's spokesperson fanyana shiburi told the times of swaziland .
" our customers are exclusive people , the super-rich , the kings and queens , oil-rich countries , north africans and massive lottery winners , " he added .
just three other people in southern africa are reported to own daimlerchrysler 's flagship maybach 62 .
" it is unfortunate the king 's government is unable to prioritize and do things that will save the nation , as opposed to the interests of the monarch and his family , " said nomthetho simelane from the university of swaziland .
in a country where nearly 40 % of adults are hiv positive , the king is also criticised for having 11 wives and two fiancees .
in recent years , he has asked parliament for $ 15m to build a palace for each of his spouses and $ 45m to buy a royal jet .
street protests led to him abandoning the plans to buy a luxury jet .
since this story was published , daimlerchrysler sa settled a lawsuit with cyril ramaphosa confirming that he does not own a maybach 62 , as previously reported .

in a country where nearly 40 % of adults are hiv positive , the king is also criticised for having 11 wives and two fiancees .
in recent years , he has asked parliament for $ 15m to build a palace for each of his spouses and $ 45m to buy a royal jet .
street protests led to him abandoning the plans to buy a luxury jet .
since this story was published , daimlerchrysler sa settled a lawsuit with cyril ramaphosa confirming that he does not own a maybach 62 , as previously reported .

it discovered that although crime had fallen over the past decade , the prison population has continued to rise .
jacqueline tombs , of glasgow caledonian university , carried out the research and analysed sentencing trends since 1993 .
she found that scotland 's prison population had increased by almost 1,000 inmates over the past decade .
the study claimed there was an increasingly harsh climate of political and media debate about crime and punishment .
the courts and the government are being responsive to the view that the public have , that prison works tory msp bill aitken prof tombs found courts were imposing longer prison sentences for serious crimes and were more likely to jail people than they were 10 years ago .
she claimed the rapid rise in prison numbers was not linked to the level of crime , but was a result of courts sending more people to jail for longer .
the professor argued that a clear government strategy for reduced reliance on imprisonment would influence sentencing .
' tough rhetoric ' the prison population could increase by about 4,000 in the next decade to nearly 10,000 - according to figures published last month .
officials from the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- suggest the population is expected to rise to 8,100 - although they said the total could range from 7,000 to 9,500 .
scottish conservative msp bill aitken said he believed the courts were being influenced by government and public opinion .
speaking on bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , he said : " the public are seriously concerned about what they perceive as a rise in crime .
" there 's a great deal of cynicism about the figures indicating that crime is falling .
slopping out has been ended at barlinnie jail " the courts and the government are being responsive to the view that the public have , that prison works . "
the msp said that people in jail could not commit further offences .
susan matheson , director of the community safety charity sacro , said that courts had been influenced by " tough rhetoric " in the media .
she added : " interestingly , the rethinking crime and punishment initiative which funded this research also funded research into public opinion .
" we find that when the public are informed about crime and punishment , they 're definitely not as punitive as presented .
rehabilitation hope " we find that in sacro too .
when the public find out who the offender is , they very often want to help them get back on the straight and narrow . "
justice minister cathy jamieson said serious crimes like murder , rape and drug dealing should receive adequate punishment .
she added : " but we also know that prison is n't working for more minor offenders who might only spend a few weeks or months in jail .
" it 's not changing their behaviour and it 's contributing to crime .
" we can often deal more effectively with these kinds of offenders through tough interventions that also involve the offenders giving something back - visible community sentences that punish , but also rehabilitate . "
