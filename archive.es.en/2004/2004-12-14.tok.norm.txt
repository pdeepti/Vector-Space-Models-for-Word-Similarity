program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.12.2004 global tv shakes up industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your shows from your country , wherever you are what napster and kazaa did for music and movies , cybersky hopes to do for live television programming .
the online sharing software , developed by a feisty german company , aims to globalize television - but is it legal ? in 2002 , guido ciburski and a couple of his friends gathered around a computer screen and logged on to a live internet stream of the olympic games opening ceremony in salt lake city .
a few minutes later , they gave up .
“ it kept saying ‘ server busy ’ and you quickly arrive at the question : how can i expect to watch this when so many people are downloading it at the same time ? ” he said .
“ and that is where the thought ends 99 percent of the time . ”
but the 40-year-old technology engineer just couldn ’ t let it go .
he teamed up with petra bauersachs , his partner at their small tv technology company in southern germany , and began developing software to tackle the problem .
almost three years later , cybersky claims to not only allow millions of users to watch a live stream at the same time , but it lets them share live television programming on a platform similar to the peer-to-peer file sharing of grokster and kazaa .
if all goes according to plan , by the end of january , the software will allow csi fans in kuala lumpur to get the popular american show live-streamed into their apartment by someone watching it in new york , with only a five to ten second delay .
new front line in copyright battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa has been able to escape legal prosecution in providing live-streaming to the masses , cybersky could shake up the television industry in the same way kazaa and grokster shook up the music and film industry .
the legal departments of german broadcasters are already monitoring the software ’ s progress and legal analysts say cybersky ’ s potential for trading licensed programming could open up another front line in the court battles that have dogged file-sharing software since the days of napster .
but ciburski doesn ’ t seem bothered .
“ what , are we going to say ‘ we ’ re scared of how people will react ’ and put it back in our drawer so that someone else can come along and do it ? ” he said .
after downloading cybersky software , users , with the help of a tv card or webcam , a dsl connection and a connector between their television and computer , will be able to upload the programming they are watching onto a sharing platform .
after flipping through a world database of programming on offer , viewers will then be able to receive the live stream of that selected show , watching it at the same time the uploader is , with only a slight delay and at no cost .
free television , no more bugs ciburski said they have been able to solve the overload problems that plagued live streaming when too many people logged on .
the patented software eliminates the need for a server by using the peer-to-peer network .
everyone who logs on - be it 10,000 or 10 million - will be able to download at 400 to 600 kb , enough for the full transmission of television .
but the it engineer won ’ t say how exactly it all works .
“ this answer to this question is the one we sell investors on , ” he said .
how much of what cybersky does is legal is perhaps the bigger question .
in an attempt to address the potential that users will stream copyrighted television shows and movies across its platform , a disclaimer on the cybersky web site says that pay tv will be swapped only with the permission of broadcasters and touts the legal uses of the software , like the ability for people and companies to set up their own channels using webcams .
it has so far done little to assuage companies like premiere , germany ’ s only national pay tv broadcaster .
broadcasters sharpen legal challenges “ the disclaimer is not enough , ” said michael jachan , a premiere spokesman .
“ they write that and then , two paragraphs later , write that each user is responsible for what they put in there .
that ’ s a contradiction . ”
he said premiere ’ s legal department is already examining what steps can be taken against cybersky .
media rights experts say cybersky will face just as big a legal problem swapping regular non-pay television shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expats , says ciburski , want to consume both their native food and television during long stints abroad in order to live stream shows , the approval of the license holder is needed .
cybersky is side-stepping those re-transmission rights , say analysts , by essentially allowing each provider on the cybersky network to become a mini broadcaster without the legal rights to broadcast .
“ there ’ s no doubt about it that it ’ s definitely illegal , ” said oliver castendyk , a media rights specialist and co-director of potsdam university ’ s erich pommer institute for media and television .
but castendyk and others are convinced it will be hard to successfully sue cybersky .
recent cases seem to bolster their arguments .
in a legal loophole a suit by mgm seeking to dismantle the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform grokster failed in august when the us ninth circuit court of appeals said that the dutch company didn ’ t contribute to copyright infringement by providing the software to trade copyright-protected films and music online .
like other file-sharing networks , ciburski said that cybersky is not able to trace who is providing programming , and who is downloading it , making it impossible to provide such lists to broadcasters .
most broadcasters have not wanted to comment on cybersky .
but legal experts say it is only a matter of time before they will .
by the beginning of the cebit technology trade fair in march , cybersky should be fully operational - and the first suits already filed . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

the online sharing software , developed by a feisty german company , aims to globalize television - but is it legal ? in 2002 , guido ciburski and a couple of his friends gathered around a computer screen and logged on to a live internet stream of the olympic games opening ceremony in salt lake city .
a few minutes later , they gave up .
“ it kept saying ‘ server busy ’ and you quickly arrive at the question : how can i expect to watch this when so many people are downloading it at the same time ? ” he said .
“ and that is where the thought ends 99 percent of the time . ”
but the 40-year-old technology engineer just couldn ’ t let it go .
he teamed up with petra bauersachs , his partner at their small tv technology company in southern germany , and began developing software to tackle the problem .
almost three years later , cybersky claims to not only allow millions of users to watch a live stream at the same time , but it lets them share live television programming on a platform similar to the peer-to-peer file sharing of grokster and kazaa .
if all goes according to plan , by the end of january , the software will allow csi fans in kuala lumpur to get the popular american show live-streamed into their apartment by someone watching it in new york , with only a five to ten second delay .
new front line in copyright battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa has been able to escape legal prosecution in providing live-streaming to the masses , cybersky could shake up the television industry in the same way kazaa and grokster shook up the music and film industry .
the legal departments of german broadcasters are already monitoring the software ’ s progress and legal analysts say cybersky ’ s potential for trading licensed programming could open up another front line in the court battles that have dogged file-sharing software since the days of napster .
but ciburski doesn ’ t seem bothered .
“ what , are we going to say ‘ we ’ re scared of how people will react ’ and put it back in our drawer so that someone else can come along and do it ? ” he said .
after downloading cybersky software , users , with the help of a tv card or webcam , a dsl connection and a connector between their television and computer , will be able to upload the programming they are watching onto a sharing platform .
after flipping through a world database of programming on offer , viewers will then be able to receive the live stream of that selected show , watching it at the same time the uploader is , with only a slight delay and at no cost .
free television , no more bugs ciburski said they have been able to solve the overload problems that plagued live streaming when too many people logged on .
the patented software eliminates the need for a server by using the peer-to-peer network .
everyone who logs on - be it 10,000 or 10 million - will be able to download at 400 to 600 kb , enough for the full transmission of television .
but the it engineer won ’ t say how exactly it all works .
“ this answer to this question is the one we sell investors on , ” he said .
how much of what cybersky does is legal is perhaps the bigger question .
in an attempt to address the potential that users will stream copyrighted television shows and movies across its platform , a disclaimer on the cybersky web site says that pay tv will be swapped only with the permission of broadcasters and touts the legal uses of the software , like the ability for people and companies to set up their own channels using webcams .
it has so far done little to assuage companies like premiere , germany ’ s only national pay tv broadcaster .
broadcasters sharpen legal challenges “ the disclaimer is not enough , ” said michael jachan , a premiere spokesman .
“ they write that and then , two paragraphs later , write that each user is responsible for what they put in there .
that ’ s a contradiction . ”
he said premiere ’ s legal department is already examining what steps can be taken against cybersky .
media rights experts say cybersky will face just as big a legal problem swapping regular non-pay television shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expats , says ciburski , want to consume both their native food and television during long stints abroad in order to live stream shows , the approval of the license holder is needed .
cybersky is side-stepping those re-transmission rights , say analysts , by essentially allowing each provider on the cybersky network to become a mini broadcaster without the legal rights to broadcast .
“ there ’ s no doubt about it that it ’ s definitely illegal , ” said oliver castendyk , a media rights specialist and co-director of potsdam university ’ s erich pommer institute for media and television .
but castendyk and others are convinced it will be hard to successfully sue cybersky .
recent cases seem to bolster their arguments .
in a legal loophole a suit by mgm seeking to dismantle the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform grokster failed in august when the us ninth circuit court of appeals said that the dutch company didn ’ t contribute to copyright infringement by providing the software to trade copyright-protected films and music online .
like other file-sharing networks , ciburski said that cybersky is not able to trace who is providing programming , and who is downloading it , making it impossible to provide such lists to broadcasters .
most broadcasters have not wanted to comment on cybersky .
but legal experts say it is only a matter of time before they will .

the online sharing software , developed by a feisty german company , aims to globalize television - but is it legal ? in 2002 , guido ciburski and a couple of his friends gathered around a computer screen and logged on to a live internet stream of the olympic games opening ceremony in salt lake city .
a few minutes later , they gave up .
“ it kept saying ‘ server busy ’ and you quickly arrive at the question : how can i expect to watch this when so many people are downloading it at the same time ? ” he said .
“ and that is where the thought ends 99 percent of the time . ”
but the 40-year-old technology engineer just couldn ’ t let it go .
he teamed up with petra bauersachs , his partner at their small tv technology company in southern germany , and began developing software to tackle the problem .
almost three years later , cybersky claims to not only allow millions of users to watch a live stream at the same time , but it lets them share live television programming on a platform similar to the peer-to-peer file sharing of grokster and kazaa .
if all goes according to plan , by the end of january , the software will allow csi fans in kuala lumpur to get the popular american show live-streamed into their apartment by someone watching it in new york , with only a five to ten second delay .
new front line in copyright battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa has been able to escape legal prosecution in providing live-streaming to the masses , cybersky could shake up the television industry in the same way kazaa and grokster shook up the music and film industry .
the legal departments of german broadcasters are already monitoring the software ’ s progress and legal analysts say cybersky ’ s potential for trading licensed programming could open up another front line in the court battles that have dogged file-sharing software since the days of napster .
but ciburski doesn ’ t seem bothered .
“ what , are we going to say ‘ we ’ re scared of how people will react ’ and put it back in our drawer so that someone else can come along and do it ? ” he said .
after downloading cybersky software , users , with the help of a tv card or webcam , a dsl connection and a connector between their television and computer , will be able to upload the programming they are watching onto a sharing platform .
after flipping through a world database of programming on offer , viewers will then be able to receive the live stream of that selected show , watching it at the same time the uploader is , with only a slight delay and at no cost .
free television , no more bugs ciburski said they have been able to solve the overload problems that plagued live streaming when too many people logged on .
the patented software eliminates the need for a server by using the peer-to-peer network .
everyone who logs on - be it 10,000 or 10 million - will be able to download at 400 to 600 kb , enough for the full transmission of television .
but the it engineer won ’ t say how exactly it all works .
“ this answer to this question is the one we sell investors on , ” he said .
how much of what cybersky does is legal is perhaps the bigger question .
in an attempt to address the potential that users will stream copyrighted television shows and movies across its platform , a disclaimer on the cybersky web site says that pay tv will be swapped only with the permission of broadcasters and touts the legal uses of the software , like the ability for people and companies to set up their own channels using webcams .
it has so far done little to assuage companies like premiere , germany ’ s only national pay tv broadcaster .
broadcasters sharpen legal challenges “ the disclaimer is not enough , ” said michael jachan , a premiere spokesman .
“ they write that and then , two paragraphs later , write that each user is responsible for what they put in there .
that ’ s a contradiction . ”
he said premiere ’ s legal department is already examining what steps can be taken against cybersky .
media rights experts say cybersky will face just as big a legal problem swapping regular non-pay television shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expats , says ciburski , want to consume both their native food and television during long stints abroad in order to live stream shows , the approval of the license holder is needed .
cybersky is side-stepping those re-transmission rights , say analysts , by essentially allowing each provider on the cybersky network to become a mini broadcaster without the legal rights to broadcast .
“ there ’ s no doubt about it that it ’ s definitely illegal , ” said oliver castendyk , a media rights specialist and co-director of potsdam university ’ s erich pommer institute for media and television .
but castendyk and others are convinced it will be hard to successfully sue cybersky .
recent cases seem to bolster their arguments .
in a legal loophole a suit by mgm seeking to dismantle the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform grokster failed in august when the us ninth circuit court of appeals said that the dutch company didn ’ t contribute to copyright infringement by providing the software to trade copyright-protected films and music online .
like other file-sharing networks , ciburski said that cybersky is not able to trace who is providing programming , and who is downloading it , making it impossible to provide such lists to broadcasters .

not all reader comments will be automatically published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do not think that english will ever become the first language of all of europe .
however , i do fear that other languages will , in a sense , become debased further if the trend is allowed to continue .
there is simply no excuse to use english expressions where perfectly good words exist in the native tongue .
a great deal of blame for the current state of affairs must be placed on the print media , who have shown a total lack of responsibility in this respect .
it is really appalling to read the faz -lrb- frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , for example , or der spiegel , and i would imagine that the ' popular ' press is even worse . - dr. jack bremer no language is static .
english appears to have formed as a german " creole " or " pidgin " spoken with a lisp .
over the years it has been very successful at borrowing from other languages .
now if we could just simplify the spelling . … - janaburg the beauty of english is that it accepts new words from many languages for example sushi , jodhpurs and pajamas .
i guess we could say " raw fish " but then is n't fish a german word .
or how about sleeping clothes ?
i find the european complaints fairly amusing .
i was born in austria and german is my first language .
i visit relatives in graz and speak german in shops , and on the street , but everyone wants to speak english .
as an american it is very difficult to practice a language you are trying to learn when everywhere we go people want to speak english .
my daughter is spending the year in prague teaching in a pre-school .
the parents pay more than the average salary earned in the country so that their children can be taught by a native english speaker .
a language is a living organism , it needs to grow and evolve or it will disappear altogether . - tanja scarborough english will not become the first language in europe but it will become the second language to most .
for example , look at india : it has so many languages , so many scripts .
the only way one can get around at most places is english -lrb- and hindi as well -rrb- .
however , the regional languages do survive , so does english .
it would appear that europeans will have to become bilingual -lrb- except the english themselves -rrb- : their native language and english . - alok patnaik , canada the increasing use of english is all but an inevitability .
instead of complaining endlessly , why do n't speakers of foreign languages seek to add to the list of foreign words / phrases we all use , e.g. cul-de-sac , yacht , bungalow , amok , rendezvous , ante-post , quid pro quo , vox pop and zeitgeist .
i particularly like schadenfreude and ' ear worm ' for when you ca n't get a song out of your head , both of which are german in origin ! - matthew r. illsley in my opinion english will be the language of europeans during the following decades .
it will be a fact that stronger commercial and social relationships will encourage the usage of english , specifically within the new members .
although italians , germans and the french are worried as a consequence of the expansion of english language , we have to acknowledge that this phenomenon is almost inevitable .
for example , if i analyze my situation as an argentine citizen interested in other languages , i should recognize that english is the only alternative taking into consideration different situations : a -rrb- commercial influence of the language ; b -rrb- importance of the language in business issues ; c -rrb- number of possibilities that i will have to use the foreign language .
german is only spoken in germany ; french in france and other colonies of africa , portuguese in portugal and brazil and so on .
it is clear that english is a world wide language , not only considering people who manage it as a mother language but also who use it as a second one .
the case of the majority of south african people is an excellent example .
in conclusion , i firmly believe that english will gain more influence in the following decades , especially in emerging markets , such as countries who have recently joined the european union . - carlos a. ferretti i live in both europe and the us , but i have spent most of the past few years in europe .
i 'm now back in the us .
i do n't understand the problem .
this whole argument was moot from the beginning .
it is clear that all the languages of the european continent remain important to those people who speak them .
after the mother tongue everything else is forever doomed to being a second language .
how can english therefore take over an entire continent , which has traditionally been very much multi-lingual ?
i do not believe that governments should try to legislate over in what language people choose to communicate .
a language on its own can not speak .
german is the mother tongue of germany , and whatever language a german child learns next is , as has been known for many generations now , the second language .
finally , i bow to you multi-linguals of the world , particularly those people that can speak 4 or 5 different tongues . - don lilly dw staff -lrb- ncy / gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe battles english invasion fast becoming europe 's lingua franca , english has invaded other national languages .
the trend has some on the continent worried that languages might in the future take second place even within their countries of origin .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : desperately ditching denglish after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue .
-lrb- nov .
15 , 2004 -rrb- german news auf englisch costly and complicated , running a foreign language editorial operation is not an easy thing to do .
but that 's not stopping a growing number of german publications from experimenting with english-language news products .

what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .

what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .
they hear about their cousins and friends who are already there .
in that way , hasan keyf is n't so far away from us at all .
it 's just that we 're only now beginning to notice . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants accession talks in 2005 turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said wednesday he hopes accession talks with the european union begin next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.12.2004 german carmakers catch hybrid fever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruising with a -lrb- cleaner -rrb- conscience caught off guard by the success of toyota 's hybrid prius model , german carmakers are racing to catch-up .
daimlerchrysler and gm announced plans on monday to jointly produce hybrid technology for their cars and trucks . when toyota introduced the hybrid prius model in 1997 , which is powered by an electric motor for short city distances and a traditional gasoline-powered motor for longer , high-speed hauls , company executives had relatively moderate expectations .
but driven by a 153 percent rise in us sales of the flashier , improved 2004 version , toyota has been forced to boost production - from 43,000 to 130,000 cars - in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio has a toyota prius what 's more , the prius has also received car of the year awards in both the united states and europe and the unofficial endorsement of countless green-minded celebrities , including leonardo dicaprio , who like to tool around hollywood in their prius cars . caught off guard by the prius ' success , competitors , including german carmakers who have long banked on the rise of diesel-powered motors as a greener alternative to traditional gasoline powered cars , are struggling to catch up . on monday , daimlerchrysler and gm announced plans to jointly develop new hybrid technology .
other german carmakers , including volkswagen and porsche , may follow . the next big thing ? the runaway success of a hybrid car that was initially intended to exploit a green niche in the market has caused some industry analysts to wonder if the technology is sparking a revolution in the car industry .
some have even likened it to the biggest thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine .
" in 20 or 40 years " all the automotive group 's cars will be hybrids , the man in charge of toyota 's research and development , design and product development , kazuo okatmoto , told the car industry magazine automotive news europe .
" and it wo n't just be toyota .
all makers will have hybrids , " he said .
hybrid models planned for 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxious hybrid mercedes models may be unveiled in 2007 okatmoto 's predictions may well come true .
in a press statement released on monday , gm and daimlerchrysler announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding , which confirmed their intention to develop new hybrid technology together .

the decision could pave the way for the rolling back of the controversial system that critics say disadvantages foreign drink companies .
germany introduced compulsory deposits on non-reusable drink containers in 2003 because quotas for refillable bottles were not being met .
but the eu commission argued the system discriminates against the import of foreign products .
the european court concurred in part , saying germany failed to give mineral water producers enough time to adjust to the new rules and called for a reform of the recycling infrastructure .
" the deposit and return obligations introduced in germany for non-reusable drinks packaging hinder the free movement of goods if producers do not have a reasonable transitional period and a guarantee that the new system will be operational when the old system ceases to exist , " a court statement said . dw-world.de eu takes aim at germany the european union has ordered germany to improve competition in the country 's can deposit system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.12.2004 eu still at odds over turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way is the wind blowing for turkey and the eu ?
foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .
while dutch foreign minister bernard bot sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached , a new europe-wide poll has shown that many in europe still reject the idea of turkey joining the european club . " i have read about these polls , but i think what counts in the end is what the prime ministers and heads of state will decide on thursday and friday , " bot told reporters in brussels . according to the ifop institute poll of the five big west european countries , support for admitting turkey was strongest in spain -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- 49 percent -rrb- , with 41 percent in favor and 30 percent against in britain .
an opinion poll in the french daily le figaro showed 67 percent of french voters and 55 percent of germans oppose turkey joining the eu . the cyprus problem the question of cyprus has become a possible sticking point .
turkey does not accept cyprus as a sovereign state , although cyprus is now a member of the eu and could veto any decision about accession . cypriot foreign minister george iacovou has linked the start of talks with turkey to normal relations between ankara and nicosia .
" we do hope that the summit conclusions will reflect turkey 's obligations towards cyprus , " he said . croatia et al . eu foreign ministers did agree on inviting croatia to the negotiating table , likely in march of next year .
there are several prerequisites , however .
one of the most important is that croatia cooperate fully with the un tribunal in the hague regarding war crimes in the former yugoslavia . as expected , a successful conclusion to romania and bulgaria 's entry talks was acknowledged and the two eastern european countries are expected to join the eu in early 2007 .
the ministers did note that romania has several reforms it has to put into place before officially becoming a member . diplomats predict that the high-stake haggling will continue to the last minute of the summit , which is expected to end at noon on friday , although the meeting could be extended if necessary . bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike .

foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .
while dutch foreign minister bernard bot sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached , a new europe-wide poll has shown that many in europe still reject the idea of turkey joining the european club . " i have read about these polls , but i think what counts in the end is what the prime ministers and heads of state will decide on thursday and friday , " bot told reporters in brussels . according to the ifop institute poll of the five big west european countries , support for admitting turkey was strongest in spain -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- 49 percent -rrb- , with 41 percent in favor and 30 percent against in britain .
an opinion poll in the french daily le figaro showed 67 percent of french voters and 55 percent of germans oppose turkey joining the eu . the cyprus problem the question of cyprus has become a possible sticking point .
turkey does not accept cyprus as a sovereign state , although cyprus is now a member of the eu and could veto any decision about accession . cypriot foreign minister george iacovou has linked the start of talks with turkey to normal relations between ankara and nicosia .
" we do hope that the summit conclusions will reflect turkey 's obligations towards cyprus , " he said . croatia et al . eu foreign ministers did agree on inviting croatia to the negotiating table , likely in march of next year .
there are several prerequisites , however .
one of the most important is that croatia cooperate fully with the un tribunal in the hague regarding war crimes in the former yugoslavia . as expected , a successful conclusion to romania and bulgaria 's entry talks was acknowledged and the two eastern european countries are expected to join the eu in early 2007 .

foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .

what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .
they hear about their cousins and friends who are already there .
in that way , hasan keyf is n't so far away from us at all .
it 's just that we 're only now beginning to notice . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants accession talks in 2005 turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said wednesday he hopes accession talks with the european union begin next year .

what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .

but after wrestling power away from one of europe 's most notorious tyrants , the group did not fade into history . instead , they pulled their resources and founded the center for non-violent resistance in belgrade , dedicated to training protestors and grass roots activists around the world .
last year the group was involved in toppling georgian autocrat eduard shevardnadze . their most recent battleground in ukraine , however , brought them the most attention when they targeted hardliners and provided crucial assistance to protestors in the weeks following the election crisis . dress rehearsal for kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands filled kiev 's streets long before the thousands of protestors camped out in kiev 's independence square started forming human chains and blocking off government buildings in response to the fraudulent election of viktor yanukovych , organizers from otpor were already active in ukraine . a lesser known mayoral election in the small western city of mukatschewe in april provided the activists with an opportunity for a dress rehersal . volunteers from otpor travelled to the ukrainian town to train protestors and help organize the group " pora , " which means " it is time " in serbian .
applying non-violent protest techniques , the activists managed to overturn the mayorial election results , which they said were marked by voter intimidation and widespread fraud .
a group subsequently organized by pora then went on to play a crucial role during the national election , when they employed many of the same otpor techniques in downtown kiev . a " degree " in protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights 101 for ukrainians " they taught us everything we know , " olga , a leading member of pora told deutsche welle . instructors from otpor arrived in ukraine well ahead of the elections to serve as observers and help get the vote out .
they then stayed on to help organize the protests in the tumultuous weeks that followed , teaching dozens of courses in the hopes that successful " graduates " would go on to share their new know-how with others . however , sinisa sikman , one of the otpor instructors who worked in ukraine , says her organization does not export one- size-fits-all protest techniques - the group makes an effort to adapt their practices to the unique circumstances of each country it operates in .
she says the goal of otpor is to help similar grass roots groups who do n't have the knowledge or means to organize a massive protest .
it 's the enthusiasm and commitment of the protestors that provides the common thread . " i have to say , the young ukrainians are every bit as creative , educated and humorous as the serbian youth who protested against milosevic , " she told deutsche welle . otpor trainers are now looking towards belarus , where despite a recent ban on their activities , they 're still hoping to motivate young people to push for reforms .
but they are n't just active in instigating civil revolutions .
in western democracies , the serbian organization has gained a reputation for instructing various environmental protest groups . and it 's not just pure idealism that drives them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 14.12.2004 personal views of turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bridging east and west ?
what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .
they hear about their cousins and friends who are already there .
in that way , hasan keyf is n't so far away from us at all .

what do you think of , when you think about turkey ?
dw-world asked several germans with links to the country to offer their own views of the country . in germany , turkey 's possible membership in the european union is a topic of sometimes heated discussion , especially ahead of the landmark decision to be made this week by eu foreign ministers on whether or not to open accession talks with turkey . the images many germans have of turkey are often those supplied by the media , which sometimes fail to give a nuanced view of this largely muslim country on the bosporus .
public discussion on the subject in germany is often marked by clichés and fears . dw-world therefore asked several germans with special links to turkey to paint for their own pictures of the country .
what kind of experiences and associations come to mind when they think of turkey ?
a few of them are presented below . new freedoms cem özdemir , european parliamentarian for the green party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciwan haco " i do n't know which of the two of us was moved more , my friend ciwan haco or me ?
when i told ciwan , a syrian-kurdish rock musician , that some of his songs were being played at the opening of a school in southeast turkey , he was already getting ready to go on tour in turkey . once , the two of us had a conversation in berlin in which we wondered when his fans in turkey would be legally allowed to listen to his music .
that was one year ago .
since then , turkey has embarked on one of the most comprehensive democratization projects in the republic 's history . even leyla zana -lrb- kurdish politician and human rights activist . - eds . -rrb- and several of her fellow parliamentarians are free after having ten years of their lives stolen from them in a turkish prison .
finally , kurdish courses are being offered in turkey and media outlets are again publishing and broadcasting legally in the language , something that just a short while ago was not possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir i often ask myself how turkish history would be different if the military coup of 1971 had not taken place .
what would have happened to turkey if in 1980 kenan evren and his generals had n't thrown the nation 's brightest minds in prison , or sowed the seeds for future terrorism in the torture chambers of diyarbakir ? maybe it ’ s history 's revenge that the evrens and karakullukcus , the cölasans and the inces -lrb- nationalistic journalists -rrb- have to sit back and watch while ciwan haco performs in front of 100,000 enthusiastic fans .
thanks to the eu , backwards-looking forces in turkey can no longer prevent my turkish-armenian friend hrant dink from getting a passport .
thanks to the recent progress , the great novelist orhan pamuk can write his bestsellers without first having to consult a lawyer . the door to democracy is open and no military officer , no agitator with pen in hand and no bureaucrat will be able to shut it again . " between honor , family and modernity frank spengler , konrad adenauer foundation in ankara " how can you live in turkey , an islamic country ? " was the spontaneous reaction of a friend of mine when i told her i was being transferred to turkey .
others , however , were full of congratulations , since for them turkey is a kind of european " sun city " - all blue sea and sunny skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to talk about the turkey .
how does one go about describing a country which presents itself in so many varied and often contradictory ways ? for those of us in germany , the image of this country on the bosporus is characterized by our first experiences with immigrants from turkey who came to germany , mostly for work .
although members of this group set up house in berlin or cologne , they often lived out their culture just as they did before they left their rural villages in anatolia . even today , matters like tradition , faith and a particular understanding of honor and the family define the lives of many people there .
but there is also another turkey - one in which modernity and western cultural values are firmly anchored . turkey is an endearing and even intimate country , where hospitality is held in high esteem and lived out daily .
just recently , my friend who had reacted so strongly about my moving to turkey called me again .
this time i had an answer to her question . how could i live in turkey ?
just fine . " the old orient , newly awake herbert hoffmann-loss , former consul-general in istanbul beside every european image of turkey there is another - an anatolian one .
that fact reminds me , a former resident of istanbul myself , of a picture i took of the beautiful , old city of hasan keyf , which lies in the far eastern part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan keyf this picturesque place , with both anatolian and arabic roots , developed at an important crossing point of the tigris , not far from the border to syria and iraq .
with its proud ruins of the byzantine fortress of cepha and the fantastic remains of the medieval muslim city , hasan keyf seems to belong squarely in mesopotamia . europe seems so far removed from this place !
but , in fact , even the old ottoman sultans turned their gazes westward , toward vienna and the balkans .
to them , europe was a magnet that exerted a powerful pull .
it was n't until kemal atatürk and the 20th century that turkey let itself be actually drawn to the west .
but even then , quiet places like hasan keyf remained stuck in a kind of old orient slumber . but the silence here is misleading .
the innumerable caves in the ruins and on the bluff over the tigris are alive , mostly due to the droves of ragged children , agile and alert with their black , wide-awake eyes .
they 're looking at europe as well .
they hear about their cousins and friends who are already there .
in that way , hasan keyf is n't so far away from us at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.12.2004 global tv shakes up industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your shows from your country , wherever you are what napster and kazaa did for music and movies , cybersky hopes to do for live television programming .
the online sharing software , developed by a feisty german company , aims to globalize television - but is it legal ? in 2002 , guido ciburski and a couple of his friends gathered around a computer screen and logged on to a live internet stream of the olympic games opening ceremony in salt lake city .
a few minutes later , they gave up .
“ it kept saying ‘ server busy ’ and you quickly arrive at the question : how can i expect to watch this when so many people are downloading it at the same time ? ” he said .
“ and that is where the thought ends 99 percent of the time . ”
but the 40-year-old technology engineer just couldn ’ t let it go .
he teamed up with petra bauersachs , his partner at their small tv technology company in southern germany , and began developing software to tackle the problem .
almost three years later , cybersky claims to not only allow millions of users to watch a live stream at the same time , but it lets them share live television programming on a platform similar to the peer-to-peer file sharing of grokster and kazaa .
if all goes according to plan , by the end of january , the software will allow csi fans in kuala lumpur to get the popular american show live-streamed into their apartment by someone watching it in new york , with only a five to ten second delay .
new front line in copyright battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa has been able to escape legal prosecution in providing live-streaming to the masses , cybersky could shake up the television industry in the same way kazaa and grokster shook up the music and film industry .
the legal departments of german broadcasters are already monitoring the software ’ s progress and legal analysts say cybersky ’ s potential for trading licensed programming could open up another front line in the court battles that have dogged file-sharing software since the days of napster .
but ciburski doesn ’ t seem bothered .
“ what , are we going to say ‘ we ’ re scared of how people will react ’ and put it back in our drawer so that someone else can come along and do it ? ” he said .
after downloading cybersky software , users , with the help of a tv card or webcam , a dsl connection and a connector between their television and computer , will be able to upload the programming they are watching onto a sharing platform .
after flipping through a world database of programming on offer , viewers will then be able to receive the live stream of that selected show , watching it at the same time the uploader is , with only a slight delay and at no cost .
free television , no more bugs ciburski said they have been able to solve the overload problems that plagued live streaming when too many people logged on .
the patented software eliminates the need for a server by using the peer-to-peer network .
everyone who logs on - be it 10,000 or 10 million - will be able to download at 400 to 600 kb , enough for the full transmission of television .
but the it engineer won ’ t say how exactly it all works .
“ this answer to this question is the one we sell investors on , ” he said .
how much of what cybersky does is legal is perhaps the bigger question .
in an attempt to address the potential that users will stream copyrighted television shows and movies across its platform , a disclaimer on the cybersky web site says that pay tv will be swapped only with the permission of broadcasters and touts the legal uses of the software , like the ability for people and companies to set up their own channels using webcams .
it has so far done little to assuage companies like premiere , germany ’ s only national pay tv broadcaster .
broadcasters sharpen legal challenges “ the disclaimer is not enough , ” said michael jachan , a premiere spokesman .
“ they write that and then , two paragraphs later , write that each user is responsible for what they put in there .
that ’ s a contradiction . ”
he said premiere ’ s legal department is already examining what steps can be taken against cybersky .
media rights experts say cybersky will face just as big a legal problem swapping regular non-pay television shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expats , says ciburski , want to consume both their native food and television during long stints abroad in order to live stream shows , the approval of the license holder is needed .
cybersky is side-stepping those re-transmission rights , say analysts , by essentially allowing each provider on the cybersky network to become a mini broadcaster without the legal rights to broadcast .
“ there ’ s no doubt about it that it ’ s definitely illegal , ” said oliver castendyk , a media rights specialist and co-director of potsdam university ’ s erich pommer institute for media and television .
but castendyk and others are convinced it will be hard to successfully sue cybersky .
recent cases seem to bolster their arguments .
in a legal loophole a suit by mgm seeking to dismantle the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform grokster failed in august when the us ninth circuit court of appeals said that the dutch company didn ’ t contribute to copyright infringement by providing the software to trade copyright-protected films and music online .
like other file-sharing networks , ciburski said that cybersky is not able to trace who is providing programming , and who is downloading it , making it impossible to provide such lists to broadcasters .
most broadcasters have not wanted to comment on cybersky .
but legal experts say it is only a matter of time before they will .
by the beginning of the cebit technology trade fair in march , cybersky should be fully operational - and the first suits already filed . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.12.2004 global tv shakes up industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your shows from your country , wherever you are what napster and kazaa did for music and movies , cybersky hopes to do for live television programming .
the online sharing software , developed by a feisty german company , aims to globalize television - but is it legal ? in 2002 , guido ciburski and a couple of his friends gathered around a computer screen and logged on to a live internet stream of the olympic games opening ceremony in salt lake city .
a few minutes later , they gave up .
“ it kept saying ‘ server busy ’ and you quickly arrive at the question : how can i expect to watch this when so many people are downloading it at the same time ? ” he said .
“ and that is where the thought ends 99 percent of the time . ”
but the 40-year-old technology engineer just couldn ’ t let it go .
he teamed up with petra bauersachs , his partner at their small tv technology company in southern germany , and began developing software to tackle the problem .
almost three years later , cybersky claims to not only allow millions of users to watch a live stream at the same time , but it lets them share live television programming on a platform similar to the peer-to-peer file sharing of grokster and kazaa .
if all goes according to plan , by the end of january , the software will allow csi fans in kuala lumpur to get the popular american show live-streamed into their apartment by someone watching it in new york , with only a five to ten second delay .
new front line in copyright battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa has been able to escape legal prosecution in providing live-streaming to the masses , cybersky could shake up the television industry in the same way kazaa and grokster shook up the music and film industry .
the legal departments of german broadcasters are already monitoring the software ’ s progress and legal analysts say cybersky ’ s potential for trading licensed programming could open up another front line in the court battles that have dogged file-sharing software since the days of napster .
but ciburski doesn ’ t seem bothered .
“ what , are we going to say ‘ we ’ re scared of how people will react ’ and put it back in our drawer so that someone else can come along and do it ? ” he said .
after downloading cybersky software , users , with the help of a tv card or webcam , a dsl connection and a connector between their television and computer , will be able to upload the programming they are watching onto a sharing platform .
after flipping through a world database of programming on offer , viewers will then be able to receive the live stream of that selected show , watching it at the same time the uploader is , with only a slight delay and at no cost .
free television , no more bugs ciburski said they have been able to solve the overload problems that plagued live streaming when too many people logged on .
the patented software eliminates the need for a server by using the peer-to-peer network .
everyone who logs on - be it 10,000 or 10 million - will be able to download at 400 to 600 kb , enough for the full transmission of television .
but the it engineer won ’ t say how exactly it all works .
“ this answer to this question is the one we sell investors on , ” he said .
how much of what cybersky does is legal is perhaps the bigger question .
in an attempt to address the potential that users will stream copyrighted television shows and movies across its platform , a disclaimer on the cybersky web site says that pay tv will be swapped only with the permission of broadcasters and touts the legal uses of the software , like the ability for people and companies to set up their own channels using webcams .
it has so far done little to assuage companies like premiere , germany ’ s only national pay tv broadcaster .
broadcasters sharpen legal challenges “ the disclaimer is not enough , ” said michael jachan , a premiere spokesman .
“ they write that and then , two paragraphs later , write that each user is responsible for what they put in there .
that ’ s a contradiction . ”
he said premiere ’ s legal department is already examining what steps can be taken against cybersky .
media rights experts say cybersky will face just as big a legal problem swapping regular non-pay television shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expats , says ciburski , want to consume both their native food and television during long stints abroad in order to live stream shows , the approval of the license holder is needed .
cybersky is side-stepping those re-transmission rights , say analysts , by essentially allowing each provider on the cybersky network to become a mini broadcaster without the legal rights to broadcast .
“ there ’ s no doubt about it that it ’ s definitely illegal , ” said oliver castendyk , a media rights specialist and co-director of potsdam university ’ s erich pommer institute for media and television .
but castendyk and others are convinced it will be hard to successfully sue cybersky .
recent cases seem to bolster their arguments .
in a legal loophole a suit by mgm seeking to dismantle the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform grokster failed in august when the us ninth circuit court of appeals said that the dutch company didn ’ t contribute to copyright infringement by providing the software to trade copyright-protected films and music online .
like other file-sharing networks , ciburski said that cybersky is not able to trace who is providing programming , and who is downloading it , making it impossible to provide such lists to broadcasters .
most broadcasters have not wanted to comment on cybersky .
but legal experts say it is only a matter of time before they will .
by the beginning of the cebit technology trade fair in march , cybersky should be fully operational - and the first suits already filed . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

i do not think that english will ever become the first language of all of europe .
however , i do fear that other languages will , in a sense , become debased further if the trend is allowed to continue .
there is simply no excuse to use english expressions where perfectly good words exist in the native tongue .

although italians , germans and the french are worried as a consequence of the expansion of english language , we have to acknowledge that this phenomenon is almost inevitable .

daimlerchrysler and gm announced plans on monday to jointly produce hybrid technology for their cars and trucks . when toyota introduced the hybrid prius model in 1997 , which is powered by an electric motor for short city distances and a traditional gasoline-powered motor for longer , high-speed hauls , company executives had relatively moderate expectations .
but driven by a 153 percent rise in us sales of the flashier , improved 2004 version , toyota has been forced to boost production - from 43,000 to 130,000 cars - in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio has a toyota prius what 's more , the prius has also received car of the year awards in both the united states and europe and the unofficial endorsement of countless green-minded celebrities , including leonardo dicaprio , who like to tool around hollywood in their prius cars . caught off guard by the prius ' success , competitors , including german carmakers who have long banked on the rise of diesel-powered motors as a greener alternative to traditional gasoline powered cars , are struggling to catch up . on monday , daimlerchrysler and gm announced plans to jointly develop new hybrid technology .
other german carmakers , including volkswagen and porsche , may follow . the next big thing ? the runaway success of a hybrid car that was initially intended to exploit a green niche in the market has caused some industry analysts to wonder if the technology is sparking a revolution in the car industry .
some have even likened it to the biggest thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine .
" in 20 or 40 years " all the automotive group 's cars will be hybrids , the man in charge of toyota 's research and development , design and product development , kazuo okatmoto , told the car industry magazine automotive news europe .
" and it wo n't just be toyota .
all makers will have hybrids , " he said .
hybrid models planned for 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxious hybrid mercedes models may be unveiled in 2007 okatmoto 's predictions may well come true .
in a press statement released on monday , gm and daimlerchrysler announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding , which confirmed their intention to develop new hybrid technology together .
a more formal contract will be signed in 2005 . according to the statement , a few hundred million dollars - no specific figures were given - will be devoted to developing the technology , with the goal of rolling-out the first vehicles by 2007 .
among the first to hit the market will be a hybrid version of the dodge durango with a luxurious mercedes hybrid planned for later that year . next generation of hybrid cars planned but executives at gm and daimlerchrysler indicated they were n't content to ride on the coattails of their japanese competitors and promised to develop a new generation of hybrid cars incorporating the so-called " two-mode system , " which they claim will boost fuel economy in some models by 25 percent . eric ridenhour , executive vice president of product development at daimler 's chrysler division , likened current hybrid technology to videocassettes .
" we like to think of this as the dvd or streaming video , the whole next way of doing it , " told reporters in detroit monday . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars drop in reliability ratings already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable .

but after wrestling power away from one of europe 's most notorious tyrants , the group did not fade into history . instead , they pulled their resources and founded the center for non-violent resistance in belgrade , dedicated to training protestors and grass roots activists around the world .
last year the group was involved in toppling georgian autocrat eduard shevardnadze . their most recent battleground in ukraine , however , brought them the most attention when they targeted hardliners and provided crucial assistance to protestors in the weeks following the election crisis . dress rehearsal for kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands filled kiev 's streets long before the thousands of protestors camped out in kiev 's independence square started forming human chains and blocking off government buildings in response to the fraudulent election of viktor yanukovych , organizers from otpor were already active in ukraine . a lesser known mayoral election in the small western city of mukatschewe in april provided the activists with an opportunity for a dress rehersal . volunteers from otpor travelled to the ukrainian town to train protestors and help organize the group " pora , " which means " it is time " in serbian .
applying non-violent protest techniques , the activists managed to overturn the mayorial election results , which they said were marked by voter intimidation and widespread fraud .
a group subsequently organized by pora then went on to play a crucial role during the national election , when they employed many of the same otpor techniques in downtown kiev . a " degree " in protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights 101 for ukrainians " they taught us everything we know , " olga , a leading member of pora told deutsche welle . instructors from otpor arrived in ukraine well ahead of the elections to serve as observers and help get the vote out .
they then stayed on to help organize the protests in the tumultuous weeks that followed , teaching dozens of courses in the hopes that successful " graduates " would go on to share their new know-how with others . however , sinisa sikman , one of the otpor instructors who worked in ukraine , says her organization does not export one- size-fits-all protest techniques - the group makes an effort to adapt their practices to the unique circumstances of each country it operates in .
she says the goal of otpor is to help similar grass roots groups who do n't have the knowledge or means to organize a massive protest .
it 's the enthusiasm and commitment of the protestors that provides the common thread . " i have to say , the young ukrainians are every bit as creative , educated and humorous as the serbian youth who protested against milosevic , " she told deutsche welle . otpor trainers are now looking towards belarus , where despite a recent ban on their activities , they 're still hoping to motivate young people to push for reforms .
but they are n't just active in instigating civil revolutions .
in western democracies , the serbian organization has gained a reputation for instructing various environmental protest groups . and it 's not just pure idealism that drives them .
the trainers and advisors in civil protest are hired out and paid as professionals . sasa bojic -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

with state funding off the agenda , it will be financed by a high-profile ebay art sale . the show , which has been in the planning stages since summer 2002 , quickly became the subject of some seriously heated debate , with politicians yelping that the exhibition with the working title " raf myth " would glorify germany 's now disbanded raf group . such was the furor , that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of kunst-werke , the berlin institute of contemporary art , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . dogged determination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach , former director of berlin 's " kunst-werke " biesenbach vowed at the time that he would find another way to generate the € 350,000 he needed to stage the show , and although he flew the kunst-werke nest a short time ago to continue feathering his career at the museum of modern art in new york , he has remained true to his word . before his departure , he and his team worked through a new concept for the show , gave up the idea of an interdisciplinary artistic-cultural-historical approach in favor of pure art , and returned € 45,000 to berlin 's city fund from the first grant they received for the exhibition . it was a clear stance to take , but did n't exactly free the financial impasse .
but now the solution has been found in the ether .
fourteen renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman are to auction pieces of work on ebay and donate the proceeds to the artistic cause . going once , going twice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas gursky will participate in the auction .
the online sale kicked off on sunday and will be open for bids until dec .
22 .
the collective reserve price is set at € 150,000 , but the hope is , of course , that the wealthy world of art buyers will dig much deeper than that . the baton has now been passed to curator ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , and the show , under the new name of " regarding terror : the raf .
exhibition , " is due to open its doors on jan .

foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .
while dutch foreign minister bernard bot sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached , a new europe-wide poll has shown that many in europe still reject the idea of turkey joining the european club . " i have read about these polls , but i think what counts in the end is what the prime ministers and heads of state will decide on thursday and friday , " bot told reporters in brussels . according to the ifop institute poll of the five big west european countries , support for admitting turkey was strongest in spain -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- 49 percent -rrb- , with 41 percent in favor and 30 percent against in britain .
an opinion poll in the french daily le figaro showed 67 percent of french voters and 55 percent of germans oppose turkey joining the eu . the cyprus problem the question of cyprus has become a possible sticking point .
turkey does not accept cyprus as a sovereign state , although cyprus is now a member of the eu and could veto any decision about accession . cypriot foreign minister george iacovou has linked the start of talks with turkey to normal relations between ankara and nicosia .
" we do hope that the summit conclusions will reflect turkey 's obligations towards cyprus , " he said . croatia et al . eu foreign ministers did agree on inviting croatia to the negotiating table , likely in march of next year .
there are several prerequisites , however .
one of the most important is that croatia cooperate fully with the un tribunal in the hague regarding war crimes in the former yugoslavia . as expected , a successful conclusion to romania and bulgaria 's entry talks was acknowledged and the two eastern european countries are expected to join the eu in early 2007 .
the ministers did note that romania has several reforms it has to put into place before officially becoming a member . diplomats predict that the high-stake haggling will continue to the last minute of the summit , which is expected to end at noon on friday , although the meeting could be extended if necessary . bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike .

foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .
while dutch foreign minister bernard bot sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached , a new europe-wide poll has shown that many in europe still reject the idea of turkey joining the european club . " i have read about these polls , but i think what counts in the end is what the prime ministers and heads of state will decide on thursday and friday , " bot told reporters in brussels . according to the ifop institute poll of the five big west european countries , support for admitting turkey was strongest in spain -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- 49 percent -rrb- , with 41 percent in favor and 30 percent against in britain .
an opinion poll in the french daily le figaro showed 67 percent of french voters and 55 percent of germans oppose turkey joining the eu . the cyprus problem the question of cyprus has become a possible sticking point .
turkey does not accept cyprus as a sovereign state , although cyprus is now a member of the eu and could veto any decision about accession . cypriot foreign minister george iacovou has linked the start of talks with turkey to normal relations between ankara and nicosia .
" we do hope that the summit conclusions will reflect turkey 's obligations towards cyprus , " he said . croatia et al . eu foreign ministers did agree on inviting croatia to the negotiating table , likely in march of next year .
there are several prerequisites , however .
one of the most important is that croatia cooperate fully with the un tribunal in the hague regarding war crimes in the former yugoslavia . as expected , a successful conclusion to romania and bulgaria 's entry talks was acknowledged and the two eastern european countries are expected to join the eu in early 2007 .
the ministers did note that romania has several reforms it has to put into place before officially becoming a member . diplomats predict that the high-stake haggling will continue to the last minute of the summit , which is expected to end at noon on friday , although the meeting could be extended if necessary . bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike .

the complaint was filed in berlin on nov .
30 by the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association on behalf of four iraqis who were alleged to have been mistreated by us soldiers . besides rumsfeld , former cia director george tenet , undersecretary of defense for intelligence steven cambone , lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , brigadier general janis karpinski and five other military officers who served in iraq were named in the complaint , which seeks an investigation into their role in the prisoner abuses at abu ghraib . us-german relations at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photos indicating abuse at abu ghraib prompted the lawsuit " generally speaking , as is true anywhere , if these kinds of lawsuits take place with american servicemen in the cross-hairs , you bet it 's something we take seriously , " said lawrence dirita , the pentagon 's spokesman .
" if you get an adventurous prosecutor who might want to seize onto one of these frivolous lawsuits , it could affect the broader relationship .
i think that 's probably safe to say , " he told afp . germany is home to some 70,000 us troops , many of which have rotated into and out of iraq from german bases .

foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .
but even at the last minute , they are not all of one mind . britain and germany have shown strong support for turkey 's eu bid .
but their enthusiasm is not shared by all of the 25 foreign ministers meeting in brussels .
some are still arguing for an alternative to full membership , although they call it by different names .
france describes it as a " third way , " austria prefers the term " privileged partnership . " " we are of the opinion , that we should consider another option that the negotiation partners can accept as reasonable and appropriate , " said ursula plassnik , austria 's foreign minister . but germany and the uk have rejected such an option .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said that talks are being considered , precisely because turkey has fulfilled the requirements for eu membership .
he stressed that the actual entry would not be decided for some 10 or even 15 years , since negotiations are expected to last that long . " there is no automatic accession .
it is an open-ended process but with a clear goal , not aiming at alternatives , " fischer said . a final formulation must be found over the next few days .
eu heads of state are meeting on thursday and friday , when they will have to negotiate a date for the accession talks to begin .
france wants to push back that date until the end of 2005 , so it will not collide with a referendum on the eu constitution . austria has voiced concern that the integration of turkey into the eu will be a financial headache , costing as much as € 30 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- a year , according to austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . polls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister bernard bot , right , gestures while speaking with european commission president jose manuel barroso , left the dutch , who currently hold the rotating eu presidency , are trying to work out a compromise that could be accepted by all 25 states .
while dutch foreign minister bernard bot sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached , a new europe-wide poll has shown that many in europe still reject the idea of turkey joining the european club . " i have read about these polls , but i think what counts in the end is what the prime ministers and heads of state will decide on thursday and friday , " bot told reporters in brussels . according to the ifop institute poll of the five big west european countries , support for admitting turkey was strongest in spain -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- 49 percent -rrb- , with 41 percent in favor and 30 percent against in britain .
an opinion poll in the french daily le figaro showed 67 percent of french voters and 55 percent of germans oppose turkey joining the eu . the cyprus problem the question of cyprus has become a possible sticking point .
turkey does not accept cyprus as a sovereign state , although cyprus is now a member of the eu and could veto any decision about accession . cypriot foreign minister george iacovou has linked the start of talks with turkey to normal relations between ankara and nicosia .
" we do hope that the summit conclusions will reflect turkey 's obligations towards cyprus , " he said . croatia et al . eu foreign ministers did agree on inviting croatia to the negotiating table , likely in march of next year .
there are several prerequisites , however .
one of the most important is that croatia cooperate fully with the un tribunal in the hague regarding war crimes in the former yugoslavia . as expected , a successful conclusion to romania and bulgaria 's entry talks was acknowledged and the two eastern european countries are expected to join the eu in early 2007 .
the ministers did note that romania has several reforms it has to put into place before officially becoming a member . diplomats predict that the high-stake haggling will continue to the last minute of the summit , which is expected to end at noon on friday , although the meeting could be extended if necessary . bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike .

the king harry ferry at feock takes 23 cars and their passengers on a 450yd -lrb- 412m -rrb- trip across the river fal .
the owners of the king harry say the present ferry is 30 years old and nearing the end of its useful life .
the new king harry will begin working in 2006 when its capacity will have increased by a third .
tourism improvements the owners of the king harry said it was designed to carry 28 cars on every crossing , but modern cars were longer and wider so 23 is now the maximum .
the new ferry will take 34 cars on every journey and the company says it will be more environmentally-friendly as it will be quieter and use less fuel .
carleen keleman from the objective one fund said about £ 1m of european union cash will be donated towards the project , with the ferry company finding the rest .
ms keleman said the investment in a new ferry would bring improvements for both tourism and business as queues should be cut in the summer .
the first steam ferry service across the fal from feock to philleigh on the roseland peninsula started in 1888 .
the current ferry has been in service from 1974 .
it carried 300,000 cars and a million people last year .
in a report compiled by independent travel writer ryan levitt , the ferry was described as amongst the most picturesque in the world because of its view of the river , rivalling lake titicaca in bolivia and the grand canal in venice .

the age at which people can legally buy cigarettes was increased from 16 to 18 after plans approved by the states in november were introduced this month .
the youth council said it was not against the change .
but it added that its members felt there was not enough discussion between young people and states members before the decision was made .

oversight commissioner al hutchinson said it was " most important " that all community and political groups back policing institutions .
in his latest report , he said the lack of acceptance was in danger of affecting the whole reform process .
mr hutchinson also noted the " slow and seemingly painful " pace of de-fortifying police stations .
' significant progress ' the independent commission on policing for northern ireland , also known as the patten commission , was set up after the good friday agreement in 1998 to develop a framework for a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the whole community .
the patten commission said an independent person should be selected to oversee the implementation of its 175 recommendations .
mr hutchinson , an officer with the royal canadian mounted police for 34 years , took over from tom constantine who held the position from may 2000 until his retirement at the end of 2003 .
in his 12th report on the pace of change published on tuesday , mr hutchinson said real and significant progress had been made .
he said : " a remarkable transformation in policing has taken place in a relatively short period since autumn 2001 , and most structural , organisational and functional changes are firmly established . "
there is a sense that it has lost momentum , and that there is a need to refresh the effort al hutchinson oversight commissioner however , the commissioner pointed to a lack of progress in some areas .
he said : " the day-to-day reality that people are faced with in terms of their community 's police station is not so different from the past : armoured gates and guard posts , high blast walls , bleak and dingy reception areas .
" if the community is ever to view its police service in a different light , then everything that the psni can do to put more police officers on the streets , and make its buildings as normal and inviting as possible , can only accelerate the shift in its relationship with the community . "
with parts of the public still to back the psni , including republicans , he called for a " big new push " .
longer term attempts to bring in more catholic officers have been replicated among civilian staff .
but the commissioner insisted : " they -lrb- the attempts -rrb- are not working as intended , and likely can not work in the longer term .
" our last statistics indicate that the percentage of catholics among civilian staff had risen from only 12.3 % in 1999 to 14.4 % in 2004 . "
so to change the representation and bring more roman catholics into the civilian support staff side of the business , we would really need a severance programme acc roy toner psni any delays in recruiting qualified civilians is also hindering efforts to get more police on patrol , he said .
" this simply means that there are fewer police officers on the street today than there might have been , " according to mr hutchinson .
assistant chief constable roy toner said more police officers were being put out onto the streets .
" on the civilisation aspect i think al has got it wrong here , " he said .
" the difficulty is that we have 3,500 civilian support staff , who do a tremendous job in supporting our frontline policing .
" the difficulty is that there is no money for any more civilian support staff - we have reached our ceiling - that 's it .
" there is no severance programme for civilian support staff , there is no early retirement programme for them , as there is for police officers .
he said it was unfortunate that " not all sections of the community are totally on board " in relation to police reform .

in his latest report , he said the lack of acceptance was in danger of affecting the whole reform process .
mr hutchinson also noted the " slow and seemingly painful " pace of de-fortifying police stations .
' significant progress ' the independent commission on policing for northern ireland , also known as the patten commission , was set up after the good friday agreement in 1998 to develop a framework for a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the whole community .
the patten commission said an independent person should be selected to oversee the implementation of its 175 recommendations .
mr hutchinson , an officer with the royal canadian mounted police for 34 years , took over from tom constantine who held the position from may 2000 until his retirement at the end of 2003 .
in his 12th report on the pace of change published on tuesday , mr hutchinson said real and significant progress had been made .
he said : " a remarkable transformation in policing has taken place in a relatively short period since autumn 2001 , and most structural , organisational and functional changes are firmly established . "
there is a sense that it has lost momentum , and that there is a need to refresh the effort al hutchinson oversight commissioner however , the commissioner pointed to a lack of progress in some areas .
he said : " the day-to-day reality that people are faced with in terms of their community 's police station is not so different from the past : armoured gates and guard posts , high blast walls , bleak and dingy reception areas .
" if the community is ever to view its police service in a different light , then everything that the psni can do to put more police officers on the streets , and make its buildings as normal and inviting as possible , can only accelerate the shift in its relationship with the community . "
with parts of the public still to back the psni , including republicans , he called for a " big new push " .
longer term attempts to bring in more catholic officers have been replicated among civilian staff .
but the commissioner insisted : " they -lrb- the attempts -rrb- are not working as intended , and likely can not work in the longer term .
" our last statistics indicate that the percentage of catholics among civilian staff had risen from only 12.3 % in 1999 to 14.4 % in 2004 . "
so to change the representation and bring more roman catholics into the civilian support staff side of the business , we would really need a severance programme acc roy toner psni any delays in recruiting qualified civilians is also hindering efforts to get more police on patrol , he said .
" this simply means that there are fewer police officers on the street today than there might have been , " according to mr hutchinson .
assistant chief constable roy toner said more police officers were being put out onto the streets .
" on the civilisation aspect i think al has got it wrong here , " he said .
" the difficulty is that we have 3,500 civilian support staff , who do a tremendous job in supporting our frontline policing .
" the difficulty is that there is no money for any more civilian support staff - we have reached our ceiling - that 's it .
" there is no severance programme for civilian support staff , there is no early retirement programme for them , as there is for police officers .
he said it was unfortunate that " not all sections of the community are totally on board " in relation to police reform .

forecasts predict that british people will spend £ 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season , an increase of 64 % on 2003 .
surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising , as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online .
savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in high street stores .
top shoppers almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers .
about 85 % of this group , 18m people , expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year , reports the industry group .
on average each shopper will spend £ 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping .
almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 % from german shoppers and only 4 % from italian gift buyers .
james roper , director of the imrg , said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras .
mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas .
he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular .
a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents , such as lingerie , for wives and girlfriends .
much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time , according to research carried out by security firm st bernard software .
the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer .
worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket , suggests the research , who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops .
big money iggy fanlo , chief revenue officer at shopping.com , said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping .
" when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher , " he said .
higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster , he said , which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy .
the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing , he said .
" the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price , " he said .
" the number one reason now is convenience . "
" very few consumers click on the lowest price , " he said .
" they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability . "
consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service .
data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site .
according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site .
the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores .
similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2 , which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle .
the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up .
in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for £ 104.99 .
in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure .
many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country .
the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans .

mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas .
he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular .
a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents , such as lingerie , for wives and girlfriends .
much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time , according to research carried out by security firm st bernard software .
the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer .
worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket , suggests the research , who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops .
big money iggy fanlo , chief revenue officer at shopping.com , said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping .
" when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher , " he said .
higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster , he said , which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy .
some shoppers are after the latest gadgets such as the psp the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing , he said .
" the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price , " he said .
" the number one reason now is convenience . "
" very few consumers click on the lowest price , " he said .
" they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability . "
consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service .
data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site .
according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site .
the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores .
similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2 , which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle .
the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up .
in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for £ 104.99 .
in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure .
many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country .
the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans .

about 85 % of this group , 18m people , expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year , reports the industry group .
on average each shopper will spend £ 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping .
some are turning to ebay to get presents hard to find elsewhere almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 % from german shoppers and only 4 % from italian gift buyers .
james roper , director of the imrg , said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras .
mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas .
he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular .
a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents , such as lingerie , for wives and girlfriends .
much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time , according to research carried out by security firm st bernard software .
the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer .
worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket , suggests the research , who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops .
big money iggy fanlo , chief revenue officer at shopping.com , said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping .
" when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher , " he said .
higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster , he said , which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy .
some shoppers are after the latest gadgets such as the psp the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing , he said .
" the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price , " he said .
" the number one reason now is convenience . "
" very few consumers click on the lowest price , " he said .
" they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability . "
consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service .
data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site .
according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site .
the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores .
similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2 , which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle .
the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up .
in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for £ 104.99 .
in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure .
many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country .
the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans .
