an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .

" the center , situated in central paris , was gutted by the fire set around 3 a.m. on sunday . police found swastikas daubed in red ink on two fridges inside and poorly spelled anti-semitic slogans . " without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .
if the firemen had not intervened , the lives of the people living in the building would have been in danger . " the jewish center sits on the ground floor of five-storey building of which the upper floors are apartments .

" the center , situated in central paris , was gutted by the fire set around 3 a.m. on sunday . police found swastikas daubed in red ink on two fridges inside and poorly spelled anti-semitic slogans . " without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .

firemen extinguished the blaze within an hour of being called out and there were no casualties . the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , who also visited the scene , expressed his " shock and horror , " adding that the " nazi and anti-semitic inscriptions daubed around the center are revolting .

two other jewish cemeteries , a world war ii monument to jewish soldiers and a synagogue have also been targeted for anti-semitic graffiti in separate attacks earlier this year . there have been a few serious assaults .
in october last year , a rabbi was knocked to the ground by assailants as he went to a synagogue ; in july last year , students at a jewish school in paris were beaten with sticks and bars ; and in april 2002 , 14 jewish footballers were set upon by a masked gang wielding bars and sticks . french-israeli tensions diplomatic tensions linked to the acts have colored relations between france and israel . a row that broke out in july this year when israeli prime minister ariel sharon urged french jews to move to israel to escape what he called " the wildest anti-semitism " in france only calmed when sharon modified his call to say jews should move to israel " because it is their homeland , not to flee anti-semitism . " sharon also praised france 's crackdown on anti-semitism , saying he hoped it would set an example for other countries . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu passport gets popular in israel more israelis with european ancestry are applying for eu passports since the union 's enlargement in may .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .

" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .

" the center , situated in central paris , was gutted by the fire set around 3 a.m. on sunday . police found swastikas daubed in red ink on two fridges inside and poorly spelled anti-semitic slogans . " without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .
if the firemen had not intervened , the lives of the people living in the building would have been in danger . " the jewish center sits on the ground floor of five-storey building of which the upper floors are apartments .
firemen extinguished the blaze within an hour of being called out and there were no casualties . the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , who also visited the scene , expressed his " shock and horror , " adding that the " nazi and anti-semitic inscriptions daubed around the center are revolting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- said that " france will be extremely severe with those who perpetrate anti-semitism , " noting they risked maximum prison sentences of up to 20 years . " it 's an insult to see swastikas at a time when we are celebrating the liberation -lrb- in world war ii -rrb- of our country , " he said . anti-semitism surges in france france has had its image abroad tarnished by anti-semitic acts that have surged over the past four years , a phenomenon that has paralleled with the rise in violence between israelis and palestinians . the country is home to europe 's biggest jewish and muslim communities , estimated at 650,000 and five million respectively , out of an overall population of 60 million . the number of anti-semitic acts committed in the first half of 2004 has soared , according to interior ministry statistics , with 135 acts of physical violence against jews and 95 against north african and other ethnic groups . incidents this month included a swastika painted on the ground in front of the notre-dame cathedral in paris , and swastikas and anti-semitic messages painted on 60 jewish graves in lyon allegedly by a neo-nazi frenchman who turned himself into police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swastikas and other nazi symbols are seen on headstones at a jewish cemetery in herrlisheim , eastern france , on april 30 , 2004 .
two other jewish cemeteries , a world war ii monument to jewish soldiers and a synagogue have also been targeted for anti-semitic graffiti in separate attacks earlier this year . there have been a few serious assaults .
in october last year , a rabbi was knocked to the ground by assailants as he went to a synagogue ; in july last year , students at a jewish school in paris were beaten with sticks and bars ; and in april 2002 , 14 jewish footballers were set upon by a masked gang wielding bars and sticks . french-israeli tensions diplomatic tensions linked to the acts have colored relations between france and israel . a row that broke out in july this year when israeli prime minister ariel sharon urged french jews to move to israel to escape what he called " the wildest anti-semitism " in france only calmed when sharon modified his call to say jews should move to israel " because it is their homeland , not to flee anti-semitism .

" without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .
if the firemen had not intervened , the lives of the people living in the building would have been in danger . " the jewish center sits on the ground floor of five-storey building of which the upper floors are apartments .
firemen extinguished the blaze within an hour of being called out and there were no casualties . the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , who also visited the scene , expressed his " shock and horror , " adding that the " nazi and anti-semitic inscriptions daubed around the center are revolting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- said that " france will be extremely severe with those who perpetrate anti-semitism , " noting they risked maximum prison sentences of up to 20 years . " it 's an insult to see swastikas at a time when we are celebrating the liberation -lrb- in world war ii -rrb- of our country , " he said . anti-semitism surges in france france has had its image abroad tarnished by anti-semitic acts that have surged over the past four years , a phenomenon that has paralleled with the rise in violence between israelis and palestinians . the country is home to europe 's biggest jewish and muslim communities , estimated at 650,000 and five million respectively , out of an overall population of 60 million . the number of anti-semitic acts committed in the first half of 2004 has soared , according to interior ministry statistics , with 135 acts of physical violence against jews and 95 against north african and other ethnic groups . incidents this month included a swastika painted on the ground in front of the notre-dame cathedral in paris , and swastikas and anti-semitic messages painted on 60 jewish graves in lyon allegedly by a neo-nazi frenchman who turned himself into police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swastikas and other nazi symbols are seen on headstones at a jewish cemetery in herrlisheim , eastern france , on april 30 , 2004 .
two other jewish cemeteries , a world war ii monument to jewish soldiers and a synagogue have also been targeted for anti-semitic graffiti in separate attacks earlier this year . there have been a few serious assaults .
in october last year , a rabbi was knocked to the ground by assailants as he went to a synagogue ; in july last year , students at a jewish school in paris were beaten with sticks and bars ; and in april 2002 , 14 jewish footballers were set upon by a masked gang wielding bars and sticks . french-israeli tensions diplomatic tensions linked to the acts have colored relations between france and israel . a row that broke out in july this year when israeli prime minister ariel sharon urged french jews to move to israel to escape what he called " the wildest anti-semitism " in france only calmed when sharon modified his call to say jews should move to israel " because it is their homeland , not to flee anti-semitism . " sharon also praised france 's crackdown on anti-semitism , saying he hoped it would set an example for other countries . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu passport gets popular in israel more israelis with european ancestry are applying for eu passports since the union 's enlargement in may .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .

" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .

" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .

" the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .

it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .
she said she had always dreamed about being able to walk out her door and jump in the water . " now that dream has come true , " she said .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .

" the center , situated in central paris , was gutted by the fire set around 3 a.m. on sunday . police found swastikas daubed in red ink on two fridges inside and poorly spelled anti-semitic slogans . " without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .
if the firemen had not intervened , the lives of the people living in the building would have been in danger . " the jewish center sits on the ground floor of five-storey building of which the upper floors are apartments .
firemen extinguished the blaze within an hour of being called out and there were no casualties . the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , who also visited the scene , expressed his " shock and horror , " adding that the " nazi and anti-semitic inscriptions daubed around the center are revolting .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .
i 'll definitely come back . " regular pool visitor lisette , 39 , who was sitting beside her , said she did n't mind the dark clouds that were gathering overhead .
in fact , this urban oasis has become so popular , she said she preferred it when the weather was a little uncertain . " it 's not so crowded now as it can get when it 's sunny and hot , " she said .
" you can just sit back and relax here better than you can in any other place in berlin . " a few raindrops did n't prevent 49-year-old ingrid from donning her swim cap and jumping in for a few laps .
an enthusiastic water fan , she moved to her apartment right around the corner 20 years ago to be close to the river .

an art project on berlin 's spree river is also one of this summer 's biggest hits - a swimming pool anchored out in the river .
it 's proven an irresistible draw for water-loving residents of this land-locked capital . last year , berliners went wild over the " beach bars " on berlin 's spree river .
tons of sand were trucked in creating faux seashores in middle of the capital where hipsters could hang out sunning themselves in deck chairs while sipping cocktails . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrance to the " swimming ship " this year , the concept has gone one step further and a little water has been added to the mix in the form of a low-slung swimming pool right in the river .
the badeschiff , or swimming ship , is a magnet for surf-starved residents in search of a near-beach experience . its neighbourhood , a somewhat gritty section of the eastern berlin district of treptow , seems an unlikely candidate for sand-and-surf frolicking .
indeed , the badeschiff lies tucked squarely in the urban landscape , behind the dark brick buildings of a former bus depot . but once visitors pass through the entrance gate , they encounter cool bright sand , hammocks , folding beach chairs and the cool blue water of the pool itself , where they can swim from 8 a.m. to midnight . designed by berlin artist susanne lorenz , the spree swimming pool was fashioned out of a shallow river cargo container .
it 's a rectangle , 32.5 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- long by 8.2 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- wide and just over two meters -lrb- six feet -rrb- deep . the ship 's filled with 400,000 liters -lrb- 105,668 gallons -rrb- of fresh water that 's been slightly chlorinated .
the water is heated to a comfortable 24 degrees celsius -lrb- 75.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the pool has been filled so that its water level is almost even with the pool 's edge , which itself is 70 centimeters -lrb- 28 inches -rrb- above the surface of the river . " we wanted swimmers to be as close to the spree as possible , " laurenz told dw-world .
" it allows swimmers to have views of the surrounding city while they swim . " connection to the past lorenz took her idea of the spree pool from the past , when berlin 's river was home to many swimming facilities . in 1906 , there were eleven swimming areas for men and seven for women .
but over the years , pollution turned swimming in the spree into a health hazard and bathers had to abandon it for the region 's lakes or municipal swimming pools . the pool project itself is part of a larger exhibition sponsored by the city art project association that examines different kinds of connections people have with their urban environment .
lorenz and her partners on the project , the architecture firm amp , wanted the pool to reintroduce berliners to an aspect of their river that has been lost . " it 's designed to be kind of a mix between a lake and a swimming pool , " lorenz said .
" it has a connection to the past , but is a modern place as well . " bar with swimming near the entrance , there 's a large area covered with sand and a few folding chairs , a long bar and a covered pavilion where dj 's spin their records on the many event nights .
those tired of swimming can work off a few more calories on the sandy dance floor . bildunterschrift : nighttime at the ship " we envisioned the whole area as a kind of bar where one can go swimming as well , " lone bech of the event production company arena told dw-world .
" at night , the pool is lit and you have berlin 's night sky .
the mood is really great . " the company , which manages the neighboring glass house theater and several other berlin entertainment venues , covered 80 percent of the badeschiff 's costs , which bech would only say have run well over € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . but the expense has been worth it , she said .
in fact , the popularity of the facility has been such that what was built as a temporary installation could become permanent .
the company is considering keeping the badeschiff open throughout the year and installing saunas to help stave off winter 's chill . pure relaxation as one approaches the river from the bar area , the sand gives way to a large wooden deck that leads out to the pool itself .
posts rising above the deck surface double as supports for hammocks .
more deck chairs are scattered about as well as cushion-covered platforms and even a king-sized metal bed frame .
there is almost no traffic noise to be heard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swimming on the spree on a recent day , the weather was overcast and the slight breeze was cool .
even so , at 10:30 a.m. two people were swimming laps in the pool while a few others were sitting on a ledge at one end , enjoying the views across the river . " it 's a nice mix here of the artistic and the practical , " said sandra , 31 , who was there for the first time .
" you can swim right in the middle of this completely urban setting .

" the center , situated in central paris , was gutted by the fire set around 3 a.m. on sunday . police found swastikas daubed in red ink on two fridges inside and poorly spelled anti-semitic slogans . " without jews , we would be happy , " one of the inscriptions read , according to police . " the world would be pure if there were no more jews , " read another , the deputy president of the neighbouring synagogue , serge benhamou , told afp news service . " it was a place full of spirit and life for our community , " said claire romi , a member of a judeo-spanish association that used the center .
" to see it like this breaks my heart - it 's a whole piece of our history that has collapsed . " " a totally unacceptable criminal act " paris police chief jean-paul proust , who visited the scene , vowed that officials would find those responsible and take them before the courts . he said the arson attack was " a totally unacceptable criminal act .
if the firemen had not intervened , the lives of the people living in the building would have been in danger . " the jewish center sits on the ground floor of five-storey building of which the upper floors are apartments .
firemen extinguished the blaze within an hour of being called out and there were no casualties . the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , who also visited the scene , expressed his " shock and horror , " adding that the " nazi and anti-semitic inscriptions daubed around the center are revolting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- said that " france will be extremely severe with those who perpetrate anti-semitism , " noting they risked maximum prison sentences of up to 20 years . " it 's an insult to see swastikas at a time when we are celebrating the liberation -lrb- in world war ii -rrb- of our country , " he said . anti-semitism surges in france france has had its image abroad tarnished by anti-semitic acts that have surged over the past four years , a phenomenon that has paralleled with the rise in violence between israelis and palestinians . the country is home to europe 's biggest jewish and muslim communities , estimated at 650,000 and five million respectively , out of an overall population of 60 million . the number of anti-semitic acts committed in the first half of 2004 has soared , according to interior ministry statistics , with 135 acts of physical violence against jews and 95 against north african and other ethnic groups . incidents this month included a swastika painted on the ground in front of the notre-dame cathedral in paris , and swastikas and anti-semitic messages painted on 60 jewish graves in lyon allegedly by a neo-nazi frenchman who turned himself into police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swastikas and other nazi symbols are seen on headstones at a jewish cemetery in herrlisheim , eastern france , on april 30 , 2004 .
two other jewish cemeteries , a world war ii monument to jewish soldiers and a synagogue have also been targeted for anti-semitic graffiti in separate attacks earlier this year . there have been a few serious assaults .
in october last year , a rabbi was knocked to the ground by assailants as he went to a synagogue ; in july last year , students at a jewish school in paris were beaten with sticks and bars ; and in april 2002 , 14 jewish footballers were set upon by a masked gang wielding bars and sticks . french-israeli tensions diplomatic tensions linked to the acts have colored relations between france and israel . a row that broke out in july this year when israeli prime minister ariel sharon urged french jews to move to israel to escape what he called " the wildest anti-semitism " in france only calmed when sharon modified his call to say jews should move to israel " because it is their homeland , not to flee anti-semitism . " sharon also praised france 's crackdown on anti-semitism , saying he hoped it would set an example for other countries . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu passport gets popular in israel more israelis with european ancestry are applying for eu passports since the union 's enlargement in may .

hundreds of people are said to have gathered at a makeshift camp near the site of the sangatte refugee centre , which was closed in 2002 .
shadow home secretary david davis said it signalled the government had not got a grip on illegal immigration .
the home office rejected any comparison between the new camp and sangatte .
it said in a statement : " this is not a second sangatte , which was an official camp providing shelter , food and facilities to up to 1,500 people while they attempted to gain illegal entry into the uk .
shanty town " since the closure of sangatte there have frequently been small numbers of people who have slept rough while trying to jump on the back of lorries bound for the uk .
the home office said it was working with french authorities to enforce controls and asylum claims had fallen by 60 % .
mr davis had said evidence a shanty town near the former camp was being used as a base by people trying to get into the uk showed the deal to shut sangatte had failed .
the sangatte refugee camp in northern france closed in december 2002 after a deal was struck between the british and french governments .
the controversial camp was attacked by british politicians as a haven for people-smugglers and a base for illegal entry into the uk .
illegal immigrants regularly made the short walk from sangatte to the nearby channel tunnel entrance in a bid to jump on to slow-moving trains bound for the uk .

in an interview with radio five live 's up all night he played down the threat of spam via im .
" it 's not really as dangerous as spam , " he said .
" with spim , it tends to be more of an annoyance . "
this , he says is because im protects you from the immediacy of , for instance , a pornographic e-mail which could portray an offensive image immediately upon being opened .
" with instant messaging , if i wanted to send you a piece of pornography , i 'd have to send it as an attachment for you to download and open . "
