horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .
new models must fit the bmw brand and increase the company 's profitability , he said . opel , one of vw 's toughest competitors , is showing the new astra , which is significantly cheaper than the golf , as well as its convertible tigra top twin , a sporty two-seater .
opel heralds the beginning of a battle with smart by introducing its new " trixx " ultra-compact car . but the introduction of new models in geneva ca n't cover up the fact that the world economy remains in a slump .
" a cloud of insecurity hangs over this salon , " german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- president bernd gottschalk lamented . the 74th annual motor show runs from march 4-14 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .
the role of german president carries considerable moral authority although the role is mainly ceremonial . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , hörst köhler will become germany 's 9th post-war president .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "

team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .

such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .

at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .

we want to become world champions .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .
his rivals , however , have everything to race for . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

11 terrorists gets retrial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq will get another chance .
a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .
11 attacks last month .
the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "

both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .

we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .

at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "

insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .
new models must fit the bmw brand and increase the company 's profitability , he said . opel , one of vw 's toughest competitors , is showing the new astra , which is significantly cheaper than the golf , as well as its convertible tigra top twin , a sporty two-seater .
opel heralds the beginning of a battle with smart by introducing its new " trixx " ultra-compact car . but the introduction of new models in geneva ca n't cover up the fact that the world economy remains in a slump .
" a cloud of insecurity hangs over this salon , " german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- president bernd gottschalk lamented . the 74th annual motor show runs from march 4-14 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .
new models must fit the bmw brand and increase the company 's profitability , he said . opel , one of vw 's toughest competitors , is showing the new astra , which is significantly cheaper than the golf , as well as its convertible tigra top twin , a sporty two-seater .
opel heralds the beginning of a battle with smart by introducing its new " trixx " ultra-compact car . but the introduction of new models in geneva ca n't cover up the fact that the world economy remains in a slump .
" a cloud of insecurity hangs over this salon , " german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- president bernd gottschalk lamented . the 74th annual motor show runs from march 4-14 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .
his rivals , however , have everything to race for . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .
his rivals , however , have everything to race for . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2004 geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry starts its year in geneva : audi a6 the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry . the geneva motor show is traditionally considered both the start of the auto industry 's year and an omen of how the season will go .
insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .
new models must fit the bmw brand and increase the company 's profitability , he said . opel , one of vw 's toughest competitors , is showing the new astra , which is significantly cheaper than the golf , as well as its convertible tigra top twin , a sporty two-seater .
opel heralds the beginning of a battle with smart by introducing its new " trixx " ultra-compact car . but the introduction of new models in geneva ca n't cover up the fact that the world economy remains in a slump .
" a cloud of insecurity hangs over this salon , " german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- president bernd gottschalk lamented . the 74th annual motor show runs from march 4-14 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch .

the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .

he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

" following the alleged death of a number of goldfish .
the show sends celebrity contestants into the australian jungle to perform various tasks to win daily food rations .
one viewer submitted a complaint relating to an episode in which goldfish were killed in a challenge where pop star daniel küblböck had to put his head in an aquarium .
" he was so disgusted and shocked that the aquarium tipped over , and the person alleges the fish fell out and died .
by law we have to follow up the complaint , " chief prosecutor regine appenroth told reuters news agency , adding " the stars themselves have n't made any complaints , but a private individual said they were mistreated . "
prosecutors will now be examining whether the show featured cruelty to animals .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .

oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .

the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .

such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .
11 attacks last month .
the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "

such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .

observers have been expecting the u.s. to move up to one-third of its 115,000 troops out of western europe and into former eastern-bloc territory .
german bases make up 84 percent of u.s. troop presence in europe , largely due to cold war policy .
germans have been concerned that the need for more rapid-reaction forces , the u.s. war on terrorism and berlin 's opposition to the iraq war would lead to a withdrawal of u.s. troops .
wald conceded that the u.s. military would reduce its numbers in europe , but he stressed , " we belong in germany with our forces .

11 terrorists gets retrial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq will get another chance .
a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .
the role of german president carries considerable moral authority although the role is mainly ceremonial . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , hörst köhler will become germany 's 9th post-war president .

the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .

merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .
the role of german president carries considerable moral authority although the role is mainly ceremonial . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , hörst köhler will become germany 's 9th post-war president .

likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .

we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .

at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .

11 terrorists gets retrial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq will get another chance .
a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .
11 attacks last month .
the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .
the role of german president carries considerable moral authority although the role is mainly ceremonial . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , hörst köhler will become germany 's 9th post-war president .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .

insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .
new models must fit the bmw brand and increase the company 's profitability , he said . opel , one of vw 's toughest competitors , is showing the new astra , which is significantly cheaper than the golf , as well as its convertible tigra top twin , a sporty two-seater .
opel heralds the beginning of a battle with smart by introducing its new " trixx " ultra-compact car . but the introduction of new models in geneva ca n't cover up the fact that the world economy remains in a slump .
" a cloud of insecurity hangs over this salon , " german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- president bernd gottschalk lamented . the 74th annual motor show runs from march 4-14 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .

montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .
his rivals , however , have everything to race for . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2004 geneva motor show hopes to rev up car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry starts its year in geneva : audi a6 the first signs of spring may be slow in coming to europe this year , but german auto makers are hoping the geneva motor show will help spark new life into the beleaguered industry . the geneva motor show is traditionally considered both the start of the auto industry 's year and an omen of how the season will go .
insiders agree that neither pessimism nor exuberance is apparent amongst german carmakers as the car show gets rolling on march 4 . " with the temperatures here in geneva today , you still have your mind on hibernation .
i just hope that does n't apply to the economy too .
perhaps there is stimulus on the market , though i do n't think it will be a big bang , " volkswagen chief bernd pischetsrieder said . on the defensive volkswagen , in particular , will be under close scrutiny in geneva where it will show new models in each of its six brands , from skoda to bentley .
the firm is hoping to impress with a new vw convertible coupe , the " polo fun , " and the luxury limousine " phaeton . "
the car manufacturer announced extensive cost cutting measures friday in response to weak sales and a sharp drop in profits in 2003 .
pischetsrieder dispelled rumors tuesday that factories were due to be closed and denied that his own position was in jeopardy . vw aimed to sell 600,000 golfs in 2004 , pischetsrieder announced , despite initial sluggishness since the new model 's introduction .
" whether we manage that we will see at the end of the year , " he said .
volkswagen plans to increase sales from 5 million to 5.5 million vehicles .
" selling more cars is easy ; earning money with it is the difficult question , " pischentsrieder commented .
vw subsidiary audi hopes to increase its sales with the new a6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the atmosphere is reserved at daimlerchrysler too .
mercedes saw its sales drop slightly in february compared to the previous year .
boss jürgen hubbert does n't expect an increase until the second half of 2004 , thanks to the introduction of new models .
both the new luxury cls-class coupe and the slk roadster will be on show in geneva . confidence at bmw , opel after a poor showing in january , bmw saw a 4 percent increase in sales in february , selling 77,000 vehicles .
bmw is perhaps the most optimistic german car manufacturer at the motor show , where the firm is introducing its 5 series touring station wagon , its m5 sports car series and a convertible mini . " the expansion of our product line is n't an end in itself , " chairman helmut panke explained .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .
11 attacks last month .
the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

the schumacher brothers are not the only german rivals in formula 1 .
bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory . the new cars have been well and truly put through their paces , the tires have been warmed up and everyone associated with formula 1 is raring to speed off the starting grid when the new season gets the green light this weekend in melbourne , australia .
every indication suggests that the competition and the rivalries will be as fierce as ever but as the teams and drivers count the days to the opening grand prix of the 2004 season , complex relationships away from the track are causing even more friction .
members of the bmw williams and mercedes mclaren teams will grudgingly accept that in the past few seasons , they have led the chasing pack but have never gotten close enough to stop ferrari from taking both the drivers ' and constructors ' world titles .
" the year that counts " although bmw has tasted world championship success three times in f1 , team chief mario theissen sees 2004 as a new beginning : " this is the year that counts . "
in the other camp , mercedes chief norbert haug took a stronger line , saying the talking was over and it was time for the mclaren to take action : " we do n't want to be the pr winner , but the racing winner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher .
both of the south german rivals face rising costs in their attempts to keep up with ferrari and as a result have to make loud and vocal assurances to secure that level of finance .
the pressure to deliver is palpable .
" the time of excuses is over , " said williams driver ralf schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , who himself has been at odds with his employers of late over contract wrangles .
team boss frank williams has said that the team would be disappointed " if we do not get both titles . "
bmw have , however , remained consistent in their title challenges , which should go some way to offering assurances to the investors that a title can not be too far away .
mclaren mercedes started strongly last season but eventually succumbed to a myriad of problems .
the german manufacturers have already developed a new grudge before the start of the season .
juan-pablo montoya revealed in the close-season that he will quit bmw to drive the mercedes of mclaren in 2005 .
williams staff desert for mclaren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya .
montoya , who is one of the main contenders for ferrari driver michael schumacher 's crown , has complained of a lack of motivation and ambition , something mario theissen refutes : " juan wants to become a world champion .
we want to become world champions .
we want the same thing . "
such words wo n't heal the rift which has been made even larger by the news that top bmw engineers have also already moved to mercedes .
in a bid to find the right mix to break ferrari 's grip on formula 1 , bmw and mercedes are , it seems , undermining each other 's campaigns .
with ferrari 's two nearest rivals desperately trying to find the right recipe for success , michael schumacher , the italians ' number one driver , seemed happy to concentrate purely on those in rival cockpits who will attempt to stop him notching a further record breaking championship this year , his seventh overall .
schumacher looking forward to challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher .
oozing confidence just days before the first race in melbourne , schumacher looked far from the supposedly-fallible driver some are saying is considering hanging his helmet up for good when he appeared for the world 's press this week .
at a press conference in the australian city on thursday , " schumi " described the prospect of taking to the track once more as a feeling of " pure pleasure . "
the 35-year-old german star told reporters he felt no apprehension towards the coming season and paid tribute to his engineers at ferrari for creating the 2004 version of the car that has brought him such success .
" i 'm absolutely thrilled to get behind the wheel of the new car , " he said .
champion has nothing more to prove schumacher has every right to feel at ease in the melbourne sunshine .
the six-time world champion has won three of his last four grand prix crowns on australian asphalt and has a host of other records behind him , including those for most race wins , fastest laps and points scored .
with the competing teams seemingly blind to possible self-destruction in the pursuit of both schumacher 's and ferrari 's crowns , the world champion can take to the track in melbourne this weekend knowing he has nothing left to prove .
his rivals , however , have everything to race for . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .

the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .
referring to information from the u.s. congress and german intelligence , he said the attacks had been planned in afghanistan and that al qaeda had recruited pilots . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .
this could be seen as an advantage in the role of head of state , which is largely apolitical .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president choosing germany 's next president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 04.03.2004 imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler seems set to leave the imf .
the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties . after discussions which lasted into the early hours of thursday morning , germany 's main opposition parties finally agreed to put forward horst köhler , the chairman of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington , as their joint candidate to become the country 's ninth post-war president .
the decision to nominate 61-year-od köhler for the presidency was taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives and liberals together have a majority in the federal convention , a collection of federal and regional parliamentarians , who have the power to elect germany 's largely symbolic head of state .
the vote will take place on may 23 .
the current president , johannes rau , is a social democrat .
likely knowing he had little chance for a second term with the opposition controlling the federal convention , he has decided to step down . now that cdu , csu and fdp have decided on köhler , his candidacy should encounter little opposition .
" i am very proud that we 've managed this as we have under such complicated conditions , " cdu party leader angela merkel said , adding she called köhler at 2 a.m.
washington to tell him of the nomination .
" he woke up rather quickly , " she joked .
the agreements end several months of tense negotiations between the leaders of the three opposition parties and within the parties themselves over who should succeed rau .
fdp against schäuble recent negotiations regarding the possible nomination of wolfgang schäuble , the former cdu party chairman and one-time front-runner for the presidency , had threatened to split the opposition parties . much internal criticism has been aimed at merkel for her failure to forcefully backing her predecessor .
merkel had expressed fears that schäuble would face a rejection from enough fdp and cdu members in the federal assembly to torpedo his bid .
köhler 's chances to become president rose after the fdp said earlier this week it would not support nominating schäuble .
if köhler is elected president of germany it will be remarkable twist in the story of his life and career .
born in skierbieszów , southeastern poland on february 22 , 1943 , köhler is the seventh of eight children .
his parents were ethnic german farmers from romania .
the family moved to leipzig in communist east germany after world war ii , then fled to west germany in 1954 .
köhler made a political name for himself as deputy finance minister between 1990 and 1993 under , chancellor helmut kohl .
it was köhler who masterminded the funding of the withdrawal of the red army from the former german democratic republic after the fall of the berlin wall .
he also played germany 's part in the construction and completion of the maastricht treaty which put in place the rules governing economic and monetary union in europe .
currently the head of the imf , köhler had almost disappeared from the contemporary german political scene while working and living in washington with his wife and two children .
despite being a member of the cdu since 1981 , köhler is not a party politician .

a german court has ordered a retrial for the only person convicted for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
moroccan mounir el motassadeq was serving a 15-year sentence for aiding the suicide hijackers . motassadeq was convicted by hamburg 's highest court in february 2003 as an accessory to murder in 3,066 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm . but the federal criminal court in karlsruhe has sent the 30-year-old 's case back to the hamburg high court for a new trial and judgment .
the former student 's lawyers successfully argued that motassadeq should go to court again , saying his original trial had been unfair because the united states had refused to allow witness testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's attorneys , hartmut jacobi and hans leistritz the attorneys based their appeal on evidence given during the trial of fellow moroccan abdelighani mzoudi , who was acquitted of having a role in sept .
11 attacks last month .
the anonymous information that exonerated mzoudi is thought to have come from another suspected accomplice , ramzi binalshibh , according to which only binalshibh and pilot mohammed atta - who also lived in hamburg - knew of the suicide attack plans in the united states .
binalshibh is now in u.s. custody . despite motassadeq 's conviction of being a member in the hamburg al qaeda terror cell led by atta , he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence .
in testimony during his trial , motassadeq denied the existence of a hamburg cell that independently planned the attacks .

it has split the roles of chairman and chief executive , reducing the power of michael eisner , who formerly held both positions .
mr eisner will remain chief executive , while the former united states senator , george mitchell , will become chairman .
but 43 % of shareholders withheld their votes during mr eisner 's re-election to the board .
he had faced barbed comments from rebel shareholders at the company 's annual meeting in philadelphia on wednesday .
the result is far worse than any other chief executive has had to face in a shareholder revolt .
unsatisfied but even mr eisner 's demotion is not enough for some shareholders .
calpers , the massive fund which controls the pension assets of california 's public sector , called the vote " stunning " .
" this discontent is too wide and way too deep in the marketplace , and it has led us to believe that eisner should go , " said sean harrigan , president of calpers ' board of administration .
roy disney , a former disney director and nephew of founder walt , had led the calls for mr eisner to quit .
reports said us cable giant comcast , which had put in a hostile takeover bid , wanted talks with " independent disney directors " .
earlier mr disney had told shareholders " to install a new management team " .
but mr eisner has replied by saying disney was doing " great " at a " contentious time " .
' on a mission ' walt disney shares closed in new york slightly lower , down 11 cents or 0.41 % at $ 26.65 .
roy disney has complained the company 's share price has underperformed , leaving it open to hostile takeover bids , such as comcast 's .
his ally stanley gold , in his farewell as a board member , said : " roy disney and i have been on a mission ... to save our company .
things will be different after today . "
he said mr eisner gave the impression that disney " never had a bad year " .
mr gold also blamed the disney board for not holding mr eisner accountable for the company 's problems .
mr disney held a series of unofficial meetings this week in a bid to rally support for his three-month long campaign to oust mr eisner .
he and mr gold have argued that getting rid of mr eisner would boost the value of shares , making the company too expensive for predators to buy .
not enough mr eisner is accused of poor strategic thinking and management .
according to the bbc 's north american business correspondent stephen evans , the critics argue that mr eisner has failed to " produce enough blockbuster successes in the true disney tradition " .
that is why the failure to extend a highly profitable partnership with pixar animation , the creative force behind films such as finding nemo and monsters inc , was so keenly felt .

speaking at a public debate to highlight concerns over the lack of support for disabled people to live in the community , drc chairman bert massie said that too often they had their freedom unfairly restricted .
" even prisoners are allowed out on parole , " he said .
in the late seventies , john evans spent three and a half years in institutional care following a spinal injury .
" there was no community support and i did n't want my family to support me , " he told bbc news online " my parents were ageing and i did n't want them to take on the extra pressure of having to care for me , and i did n't have enough money to buy in private care . "
mr evans said living in a care home gave him no control over things which most people take for granted .
" your privacy is often not respected , you have to have food you do n't choose to eat at times when you do n't want it , you have to get up and go to bed at times when you do n't want to - personally i saw this as an infringement of my human rights . "
he fought with his local authority and eventually persuaded them that the money spent on his care could be used to provide assistance for him at home .
now he employs a team of personal assistants to provide round the clock support .
a question of attitude " the biggest barrier to achieving this is , unfortunately , an attitudinal one , " said drc commissioner jane campbell .
" we still see severely disabled people as needing to be cared for rather than people who can take control .
" we 're seen as ' vulnerable ' and assessed in terms of risk rather than active citizens who want to participate . "
according to dr campbell - who chairs the social care institute for excellence - social services need to take a much wider view of the benefits of providing care than simply concentrating on servicing people 's bodily needs .
" we 're assessed on how many times we go to the toilet , when we need feeding and when we need to be put to bed .
" all they see is high support needs - 24-hour needs - in terms of just cost , rather than looking at what the person will then give back to the community . "
thinking on how best to provide care has shifted in recent years , but social services departments often cite cost as the reason for favouring an institutional approach . "
when there are locks on the door - that 's when it contravenes your human rights " jane campbell , drc the drc points out that there is no legal protection against disabled people being forced to live in institutional care against their wishes .
but a recent supreme court ruling in the usa has inspired campaigners who want the issue to be seen in terms of human rights .
in the ' olmstead case ' , the court ruled that the unjustified isolation or segregation of disabled people through institutionalisation was a form of unlawful discrimination .
the court also said that the us government had an obligation to provide funding to keep people out of institutions .
new broom a new body is about to assume responsibility for overseeing care provision in england .
denise platt , who chairs the commission for social care inspection , believes that her organisation will be able to make a difference .
" people who use care services will be at the centre of what we do , " she said .
the csci will be able to instruct social services to improve provision and will have the power to close down private sector providers .
and it will be able to comment on government policy - including spending levels - and can recommend that ministers take appropriate action .
for jane campbell , it is a question of people making informed choices .
" some people will choose to live connectedly , and i have no problem with that .
" but when there are locks on the door and rules and regulations - that 's when it contravenes your human rights , and your privacy , dignity and freedom . "

for many people it 's a question of freedom speaking at a public debate to highlight concerns over the lack of support for disabled people to live in the community , drc chairman bert massie said that too often they had their freedom unfairly restricted .
" even prisoners are allowed out on parole , " he said .
in the late seventies , john evans spent three and a half years in institutional care following a spinal injury .
" there was no community support and i did n't want my family to support me , " he told bbc news online " my parents were ageing and i did n't want them to take on the extra pressure of having to care for me , and i did n't have enough money to buy in private care . "
mr evans said living in a care home gave him no control over things which most people take for granted .
" your privacy is often not respected , you have to have food you do n't choose to eat at times when you do n't want it , you have to get up and go to bed at times when you do n't want to - personally i saw this as an infringement of my human rights . "
john evans fought hard to live independently he fought with his local authority and eventually persuaded them that the money spent on his care could be used to provide assistance for him at home .
now he employs a team of personal assistants to provide round the clock support .
a question of attitude " the biggest barrier to achieving this is , unfortunately , an attitudinal one , " said drc commissioner jane campbell .
" we still see severely disabled people as needing to be cared for rather than people who can take control .
" we 're seen as ' vulnerable ' and assessed in terms of risk rather than active citizens who want to participate . "
according to dr campbell - who chairs the social care institute for excellence - social services need to take a much wider view of the benefits of providing care than simply concentrating on servicing people 's bodily needs .
" we 're assessed on how many times we go to the toilet , when we need feeding and when we need to be put to bed .
" all they see is high support needs - 24-hour needs - in terms of just cost , rather than looking at what the person will then give back to the community . "
thinking on how best to provide care has shifted in recent years , but social services departments often cite cost as the reason for favouring an institutional approach .
when there are locks on the door - that 's when it contravenes your human rights jane campbell , drc the drc points out that there is no legal protection against disabled people being forced to live in institutional care against their wishes .
but a recent supreme court ruling in the usa has inspired campaigners who want the issue to be seen in terms of human rights .
in the ' olmstead case ' , the court ruled that the unjustified isolation or segregation of disabled people through institutionalisation was a form of unlawful discrimination .
the court also said that the us government had an obligation to provide funding to keep people out of institutions .
new broom a new body is about to assume responsibility for overseeing care provision in england .
denise platt , who chairs the commission for social care inspection , believes that her organisation will be able to make a difference .

for many people it 's a question of freedom speaking at a public debate to highlight concerns over the lack of support for disabled people to live in the community , drc chairman bert massie said that too often they had their freedom unfairly restricted .
" even prisoners are allowed out on parole , " he said .
in the late seventies , john evans spent three and a half years in institutional care following a spinal injury .
" there was no community support and i did n't want my family to support me , " he told bbc news online " my parents were ageing and i did n't want them to take on the extra pressure of having to care for me , and i did n't have enough money to buy in private care . "
mr evans said living in a care home gave him no control over things which most people take for granted .
" your privacy is often not respected , you have to have food you do n't choose to eat at times when you do n't want it , you have to get up and go to bed at times when you do n't want to - personally i saw this as an infringement of my human rights . "
john evans fought hard to live independently he fought with his local authority and eventually persuaded them that the money spent on his care could be used to provide assistance for him at home .
now he employs a team of personal assistants to provide round the clock support .
a question of attitude " the biggest barrier to achieving this is , unfortunately , an attitudinal one , " said drc commissioner jane campbell .
" we still see severely disabled people as needing to be cared for rather than people who can take control .
" we 're seen as ' vulnerable ' and assessed in terms of risk rather than active citizens who want to participate . "
according to dr campbell - who chairs the social care institute for excellence - social services need to take a much wider view of the benefits of providing care than simply concentrating on servicing people 's bodily needs .
" we 're assessed on how many times we go to the toilet , when we need feeding and when we need to be put to bed .
" all they see is high support needs - 24-hour needs - in terms of just cost , rather than looking at what the person will then give back to the community . "
thinking on how best to provide care has shifted in recent years , but social services departments often cite cost as the reason for favouring an institutional approach .
when there are locks on the door - that 's when it contravenes your human rights jane campbell , drc the drc points out that there is no legal protection against disabled people being forced to live in institutional care against their wishes .
but a recent supreme court ruling in the usa has inspired campaigners who want the issue to be seen in terms of human rights .
in the ' olmstead case ' , the court ruled that the unjustified isolation or segregation of disabled people through institutionalisation was a form of unlawful discrimination .
the court also said that the us government had an obligation to provide funding to keep people out of institutions .
new broom a new body is about to assume responsibility for overseeing care provision in england .
denise platt , who chairs the commission for social care inspection , believes that her organisation will be able to make a difference .
" people who use care services will be at the centre of what we do , " she said .
the csci will be able to instruct social services to improve provision and will have the power to close down private sector providers .
jane campbell links care to human rights and it will be able to comment on government policy - including spending levels - and can recommend that ministers take appropriate action .
for jane campbell , it is a question of people making informed choices .
" some people will choose to live connectedly , and i have no problem with that .
" but when there are locks on the door and rules and regulations - that 's when it contravenes your human rights , and your privacy , dignity and freedom . "

the european central bank , meeting on thursday , is likely to resist calls to fight slow growth with a rate cut .
but the euro 's rise in recent months against a flagging dollar has halted in the hope of improving us economic data .
and all eyes are on ecb president jean-claude trichet 's comments , to watch for signs of movement to come .
back from the brink among those pushing for the ecb to move quickly is german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who barely a week ago said the high euro was " not satisfactory " and was blighting europe 's economic prospects .
in february the currency hit a level of close to $ 1.30 , 50 % up on its october 2000 low .
but the prospect of some good news about us jobs later this week is helping catalyse investors to buy dollars .
early on thursday in asia the euro was trading at little more than $ 1.21 .
" the weak dollar trend has been reversed , " said yoshiharu yanagisawa of state street in tokyo .
" i think the dollar will still be bought even if the ecb keeps rates unchanged , on speculation that they will cut next time . "
up or down ?
but the ecb has demonstrated that it is reluctant to cut rates even in the face of the flagging european economy .
it may not be moved even by its own recent downgrading of 2003 growth - now forecast at 0.2-0.6 % , down from the previous 0.4-1 % .
and it has sent signals in the past that even if europe hangs behind the rest of the world , the likelihood of a global recovery is so strong as to mean the euro 's gain is not something to which it needs to respond .
therefore , much attention will be paid to mr trichet 's comments at thursday afternoon 's news conference , to see whether he gives any clues about the ecb 's thinking .
the key word is " appropriate " , his customary description of the rate level since his appointment last year .
if he does not use it , speculation about a cut could run riot .
and in any case , with growth in both japan and the us looking buoyant and the euro coming off the boil , the ecb may well decide to push up euro interest rates in the near future , rather than cutting them .

hospital doctors have warned that the shortage means operations are being cancelled .
increased pressures on the critical care sector in wales in 2000 led to doctors calling for more beds .
as a result of the concerns raised , the emergency pressures task force was set up .
it made a number of recommendations , including a substantial increase in the number of medical beds and 30 extra intensive care beds .
other measures included the introduction of seven-day working so that hospital patients could receive therapy and drug prescriptions at weekends and a comprehensive flu vaccination programme for the elderly and nhs staff .
since then an extra 15 beds have been funded .
but the intensive care society in wales , which brings together clinicians whose main interest is caring for critically ill patients , claim its not enough .
in some cases operations are being cancelled because after care beds are not available .
in response the assembly government said it believed only a small number of patients had been affected .
it said a development team would be consulting on new plans later this year .

the so-called managed prostitution zone is seen as a way of dealing with the issues of sex worker safety , as well as kerb crawling .
the zone would have a health clinic , and would be managed and policed by specially trained workers .
they are seen as a way of giving better support to the women while monitoring the situation .
it comes after a working party involving the city council and other agencies looked at ways of tackling the problem of prostitutes working in residential areas .
concerned residents two prostitutes were murdered in anfield in july 2003 by 26-year-old mark corner , who dumped their body parts in a bin bag in an alleyway .
he is currently detained indefinitely at ashworth hospital under the mental health act .

a proposal will go before sunderland city council 's cabinet on wednesday to mark the event with an annual civic service and celebration .
sunderland 's patron st benedict biscop , credited with starting the city 's glass-making industry , was chosen by city residents .
the council will be asked to formally adopt him as the city 's patron saint .
the cabinet will also be asked to explore options for the council to stage similar events to celebrate other faiths .

" this would be a chance to bring all those representatives together with the people to celebrate our many gifts and talents .
" i think it would make a very good annual event in the sunderland calendar . "
st benedict biscop was chosen in the 1990s when the sunderland echo newspaper carried out a city-wide poll on adopting a saint .
the diocese of durham has confirmed no other church formalities are required to adopt the saint .

lorca was killed by nationalists at the start of the civil war lorca never considered himself a political poet but rather a man of the people .
his works focused on human suffering and injustices .
but in the lead-up to the civil war in the 1930s , this was enough to make him hated by spain 's right-wing nationalists .
like thousands of others during the conflict , lorca was shot in august 1936 and buried in a mass grave .
in many ways he symbolises the country 's painful 20th-century history , and its modern-day struggle to come to terms with the past .
' graves of forgetting ' more than a quarter of a century after democracy came to spain , more than 30,000 victims of the civil war and the repression that followed still lie in mass graves , scattered across the country .
spaniards call them the graves of forgetting .
30,000 spanish families have no graveside to which they can bring flowers emilio silva efforts by families to reclaim their loved-ones ' remains have been hindered by a lack of official interest and funding .
but pressure to open the grave shared by lorca means the issue is coming under renewed - and for many unwelcome public scrutiny .
it comes as no surprise that the man credited with finding lorca 's grave is no spaniard .
ian gibson , an irishman and lorca expert , started looking in 1965 .
" of course then spaniards were living in a dictatorship and were not free at all to speak of assassinations and mass graves , " he says .
" but even now people say it 's better to forget .
but how can spain forget if it 's never officially remembered .
scars ca n't heal until you admit they are there . "
fame certainly other campaigners like emilio silva believes the past should not be forgotten .
we see no point in re-opening old wounds manuel atencia member of parliament three years ago he founded the spanish association for the recovery of historical memory and began the process of opening the country 's mass graves .
he asked to meet me in madrid 's largest graveyard .
" you see this , " he said , pointing at the grand-looking graves all around .
" 30,000 spanish families have no graveside to which they can bring flowers .
their loved-ones lie dumped with other unfortunates in mass graves . "
in fact , so much attention is being paid to lorca that many other families feel resentful , he says .
" they do n't see why , just because he was a poet and playwright , he should get special treatment , " he said .
" but i think this will work in their favour .
lorca 's fame is a chance for us to say to the rest of the world that we have a problem . '
pact but there are those who argue that it is for the good of spain that the past remains buried along with its victims .
thousands were killed during franco 's 40-year rule in 1975 the country 's politicians decided to draw a line under the civil war and 40 years of fascism .
there was no looking back .
it is known here as the pact of silence .
even decades later , many are reluctant to break it .
one of them is pro-government mp manuel atencia .
" of course the government recognises the rights of families to privately re-bury their dead , but we see no point in re-opening old wounds that afflicted spanish society .
these matters are for historians , not politicians , " he told me .
a considerable number of spaniards agree .
even lorca 's relatives are against disturbing their uncle 's grave - though they are being shouted down by the families of the men who share the grave and by the poet 's fans .
laura garcia lorca de los rios runs the lorca museum in granada , where the poet and his family lived for many years .
" we feel the mass graves are a kind of cemetery as they are , " he said .
" my uncle lies in good and noble company and the little information to be gleaned from digging up the graves does n't justify what is essentially an extremely violent act . "
digging out the past but blocking out the past does not stop the pain .
up to 3,000 people are buried in a mass grave in viznar , a village just outside granada , close to where lorca is thought to lie .
like the other mass graves across spain , there is little to indicate that such a tragedy is buried here in a hilly woodland .
only a clump of stones and a handful of artificial flowers mark the spot .
paco gonzalez arroyo , a local historian who brought me there is visibly moved .
" anyone who comes to this place feels the sadness and pain , " he said .
" the flowers and the stones bear witness to it - laid by the families of the dead , fed-up that their loved ones are abandoned here anonymously . "
for spain digging up the past could be the way to finally lay its ghosts to rest but the process is only just beginning .
in the meantime lorca 's fame gives a face and a name to spain 's dead thrown in ditches .

digging out the past but blocking out the past does not stop the pain .
up to 3,000 people are buried in a mass grave in viznar , a village just outside granada , close to where lorca is thought to lie .
like the other mass graves across spain , there is little to indicate that such a tragedy is buried here in a hilly woodland .
only a clump of stones and a handful of artificial flowers mark the spot .
paco gonzalez arroyo , a local historian who brought me there is visibly moved .
" anyone who comes to this place feels the sadness and pain , " he said .
" the flowers and the stones bear witness to it - laid by the families of the dead , fed-up that their loved ones are abandoned here anonymously . "
for spain digging up the past could be the way to finally lay its ghosts to rest but the process is only just beginning .
in the meantime lorca 's fame gives a face and a name to spain 's dead thrown in ditches .

lorca was killed by nationalists at the start of the civil war lorca never considered himself a political poet but rather a man of the people .
his works focused on human suffering and injustices .
but in the lead-up to the civil war in the 1930s , this was enough to make him hated by spain 's right-wing nationalists .
like thousands of others during the conflict , lorca was shot in august 1936 and buried in a mass grave .
in many ways he symbolises the country 's painful 20th-century history , and its modern-day struggle to come to terms with the past .
' graves of forgetting ' more than a quarter of a century after democracy came to spain , more than 30,000 victims of the civil war and the repression that followed still lie in mass graves , scattered across the country .

it comes as no surprise that the man credited with finding lorca 's grave is no spaniard .
ian gibson , an irishman and lorca expert , started looking in 1965 .
" of course then spaniards were living in a dictatorship and were not free at all to speak of assassinations and mass graves , " he says .
" but even now people say it 's better to forget .

one of them is pro-government mp manuel atencia .
" of course the government recognises the rights of families to privately re-bury their dead , but we see no point in re-opening old wounds that afflicted spanish society .
these matters are for historians , not politicians , " he told me .
a considerable number of spaniards agree .
even lorca 's relatives are against disturbing their uncle 's grave - though they are being shouted down by the families of the men who share the grave and by the poet 's fans .
laura garcia lorca de los rios runs the lorca museum in granada , where the poet and his family lived for many years .
" we feel the mass graves are a kind of cemetery as they are , " he said .
" my uncle lies in good and noble company and the little information to be gleaned from digging up the graves does n't justify what is essentially an extremely violent act . "
digging out the past but blocking out the past does not stop the pain .
up to 3,000 people are buried in a mass grave in viznar , a village just outside granada , close to where lorca is thought to lie .
like the other mass graves across spain , there is little to indicate that such a tragedy is buried here in a hilly woodland .
only a clump of stones and a handful of artificial flowers mark the spot .
paco gonzalez arroyo , a local historian who brought me there is visibly moved .
" anyone who comes to this place feels the sadness and pain , " he said .
" the flowers and the stones bear witness to it - laid by the families of the dead , fed-up that their loved ones are abandoned here anonymously . "
for spain digging up the past could be the way to finally lay its ghosts to rest but the process is only just beginning .
in the meantime lorca 's fame gives a face and a name to spain 's dead thrown in ditches .

a delegation led by former stormont minister bairbre de brun will meet denis bradley on thursday .
last month , figures showed the current register was down more than 28,000 electors compared to the one used in last year 's assembly elections .
the electoral fraud act 2002 introduced the need to register every year .
in the past , one form was given to every household , but now everyone has to register individually .
speaking before the talks , ms de brun said the statistics were worrying . "
those removed from the register need to try and reassert their right to vote through the existing mechanism of rolling registration " bairbe de bruin sinn fein " it is estimated that around 211,000 people in the six counties are currently disenfranchised , " she said .
" in the three months from the assembly election last november a further 28,000 people were removed from the register .
" this sort of annual shredding will continue to take place unless action is taken . "
just over one million people have registered to vote , however there is still time for people to ensure they have a vote in june 's european elections .
however , ms de brun said her party would be outlining a number of proposals to mr stanley to help restore confidence in the register .
" this meeting is part of a series of meetings which we will be having on this issue with the two governments , the electoral commission as well as international groups and the voluntary and community sector , " she said .
" it is our firm view that the legislation which has given rise to this needs to be reviewed and amended as quick as possible .
" in the meantime , those removed from the register need to try and reassert their right to vote through the existing mechanism of rolling registration . "
a report in december last year said measures to combat voting fraud in northern ireland had a negative impact on young people and those in poorer areas .
the electoral commission said this measure tended to have an adverse impact on disadvantaged , marginalised and hard to reach groups .
the report also called for a review of the special hearings procedure for those who want to be added to the electoral register .

'
the formation of the breakaway union of democratic mineworkers in nottinghamshire during the 1984/5 miners strike broke the monopoly of the national union of mineworkers .
twenty years on , neil greatrex , now national president of the udm , tells of the animosity that still remains between those who went on strike and those who did not . "
when your father dies without talking to you for six years , it shows it was n't just those bastards in the num affected by the strike .
he would n't speak to me because i was against scargill ; he would only speak to me through my brothers .
what is a scab ?
my interpretation of a scab is somebody crossing a picket line but there was n't anything official about those picket lines set up in nottinghamshire .
i have seen full grown men , hard men , crying their bloody eyes out because of the fear of going across them .
people are never , ever going to forget that .
family threatened my daughter colette was 10 at the time and i stopped her going out of the house .
we did n't want to tell her somebody was threatening to kill her ; threatening to burn our house down .
they threatened my wife , sheila .
one day 80 people gathered outside our house but i drove into the crowd and they dispersed . "
when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't " we had a copper as a next door neighbour and he put a sign in his window saying ' greatrex lives next door ' because he was sick of bricks going through his window .
and they say let bygones be bygones .
it is never going to happen , the bitterness is too ingrained .
at the time , i would think to myself : ' am i doing right ?
should i be doing this ? '
it did n't get any easier as time went on but once you have made your mind up there is no going back on it .
the reason that nottinghamshire did n't go on strike was there was never a national ballot .
num rules said a national strike needs a national ballot .
when we had our ballot in nottinghamshire two or three weeks into the strike , 78 % said no to a strike .
i am still convinced that if there had been a national vote , nottinghamshire miners would have supported the strike .
when i got the phone call that there were pickets at bentinck , i thought a lot of the lads would give in to it .
but bentinck was the only colliery that worked throughout strike and i 'm proud of that .
thatcher government when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't .
if the num had been united , thatcher would have been defeated but she would have come back .
she had made a political decision to get shot of coal . "
the num was the greatest union this country had ever seen - we used to feel lucky to be part of it " when the government saw there was a split they played on it .
they brought in armoured vehicles and all sorts to get people into work .
but i think we were right ; i think our fight was right : we redemocratised our union .
in my house i have got two long term certificates : a 20 year certificate from the num and one from 20 years of the udm .
people say i am mad to keep the num one but it was the greatest trade union this country had ever seen .
we used to feel a bit lucky to be part of the num . "

'
the formation of the breakaway union of democratic mineworkers in nottinghamshire during the 1984/5 miners strike broke the monopoly of the national union of mineworkers .
neil greatrex : " they say let bygones be bygones " twenty years on , neil greatrex , now national president of the udm , tells of the animosity that still remains between those who went on strike and those who did not .
when your father dies without talking to you for six years , it shows it was n't just those bastards in the num affected by the strike .
he would n't speak to me because i was against scargill ; he would only speak to me through my brothers .
what is a scab ?
my interpretation of a scab is somebody crossing a picket line but there was n't anything official about those picket lines set up in nottinghamshire .
i have seen full grown men , hard men , crying their bloody eyes out because of the fear of going across them .
people are never , ever going to forget that .
family threatened my daughter colette was 10 at the time and i stopped her going out of the house .
we did n't want to tell her somebody was threatening to kill her ; threatening to burn our house down .
they threatened my wife , sheila .
one day 80 people gathered outside our house but i drove into crowd and they dispersed .
when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't we had a copper as a next door neighbour and he put a sign in his window saying ' greatrex lives next door ' because he was sick of bricks going through his window .
and they say let bygones be bygones .
it is never going to happen , the bitterness is too ingrained .
at the time , i would think to myself : ' am i doing right ?
should i be doing this ? '
working miners ' homes and lives were threatened it did n't get any easier as time went on but once you have made your mind up there is no going back on it .
the reason that nottinghamshire did n't go on strike was there was never a national ballot .
num rules said a national strike needs a national ballot .
when we had our ballot in nottinghamshire two or three weeks into the strike , 78 % said no to a strike .
i am still convinced that if there had been a national vote , nottinghamshire miners would have supported the strike .
when i got the phone call that there were pickets at bentinck , i thought a lot of the lads would give in to it .
but bentinck was the only colliery that worked throughout strike and i 'm proud of that .
thatcher government when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't .
if the num had been united , thatcher would have been defeated but she would have come back .
she had made a political decision to get shot of coal .

'
the formation of the breakaway union of democratic mineworkers in nottinghamshire during the 1984/5 miners strike broke the monopoly of the national union of mineworkers .
neil greatrex : " they say let bygones be bygones " twenty years on , neil greatrex , now national president of the udm , tells of the animosity that still remains between those who went on strike and those who did not .
when your father dies without talking to you for six years , it shows it was n't just those bastards in the num affected by the strike .
he would n't speak to me because i was against scargill ; he would only speak to me through my brothers .
what is a scab ?
my interpretation of a scab is somebody crossing a picket line but there was n't anything official about those picket lines set up in nottinghamshire .
i have seen full grown men , hard men , crying their bloody eyes out because of the fear of going across them .
people are never , ever going to forget that .
family threatened my daughter colette was 10 at the time and i stopped her going out of the house .
we did n't want to tell her somebody was threatening to kill her ; threatening to burn our house down .
they threatened my wife , sheila .
one day 80 people gathered outside our house but i drove into crowd and they dispersed .
when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't we had a copper as a next door neighbour and he put a sign in his window saying ' greatrex lives next door ' because he was sick of bricks going through his window .
and they say let bygones be bygones .
it is never going to happen , the bitterness is too ingrained .
at the time , i would think to myself : ' am i doing right ?
should i be doing this ? '
working miners ' homes and lives were threatened it did n't get any easier as time went on but once you have made your mind up there is no going back on it .
the reason that nottinghamshire did n't go on strike was there was never a national ballot .
num rules said a national strike needs a national ballot .
when we had our ballot in nottinghamshire two or three weeks into the strike , 78 % said no to a strike .
i am still convinced that if there had been a national vote , nottinghamshire miners would have supported the strike .
when i got the phone call that there were pickets at bentinck , i thought a lot of the lads would give in to it .
but bentinck was the only colliery that worked throughout strike and i 'm proud of that .
thatcher government when people say to me ' did you convert to the tory government in 1984 ? ' it really tugs my heartstrings because i did n't .
if the num had been united , thatcher would have been defeated but she would have come back .
she had made a political decision to get shot of coal .
the num was the greatest union this country had ever seen - we used to feel lucky to be part of it when the government saw there was a split they played on it .
they brought in armoured vehicles and all sorts to get people into work .
but i think we were right ; i think our fight was right : we redemocratised our union .
in my house i have got two long term certificates : a 20 year certificate from the num and one from 20 years of the udm .
people say i am mad to keep the num one but it was the greatest trade union this country had ever seen .
we used to feel a bit lucky to be part of the num .

french wine-makers complain that their industry is in crisis , thanks to a government clampdown on drink-driving and a dramatic fall in sales both at home and abroad .
at les bouchons , or the wine corks restaurant just off the champs elysees , diners are happily tucking into its speciality , french fish dishes rounded off with a selection of the hundreds of french wines on its 10 page wine menu .
as its proprietor says , wine in france is less a drink , more a way of life .
yet the diners here - mostly prosperous businessmen in their late 40s and 50s - are becoming the exception rather than the rule in their fondness for a glass or two over lunch . "
we are like artists - each vintage we try to make a masterpiece and we really want to share our passion with the consumer " burgundy wine-grower agnes dewe over the past 40 years the french have halved their wine consumption , from 126 litres per person a year to just 56 .
so why are the french turning their noses up at the national drink ?
diners here say it 's a combination of things .
thierry , who runs his own business in paris , says it 's the young who are to blame .
" they drink coca-cola , or hard drinks like whisky , and no-one has the time to sit down and enjoy a bottle of wine .
it 's part of the coca-colonisation of life in france . "
his colleague laurent blames harsher drink-driving laws , which make people less likely to go out for a drink in the evening .
" we are losing a vital part of french life , " he believes .
alcoholic concerns whatever the reasons , many wine-growers in france fear that the dramatic decline in consumption could mean losing their livelihood .
a recent demonstration in the burgundy region brought thousands of wine-growers onto the streets to demand action from the french government .
they want it to repeal the law brought in by the socialist government in 1991 banning most alcohol advertising .
it was aimed at cutting alcoholism , but instead has stopped wine-makers promoting the charms of their own individual , regional brands .
a recent ad with the strap-line " drink less , but drink better " was deemed illegal by a french court .
burgundy wine-grower agnes dewe worries that wine is being demonised as a dangerous drug in france .
" we are very frustrated because we are almost being compared to a dealer , making hard drugs .
but that 's not how we feel , " she says .
" we are like artists - each vintage we try to make a masterpiece and we really want to share our passion with the consumer but at the moment we are not allowed to do that . "
ruddy-faced farmers at the annual agricultural fair in paris , the salon d 'agriculture , there 's no sign of any diminishing passion for wine .
ruddy-faced farmers and wine experts are happily sampling the thousands of bottles on offer from across the country .
but wine marketer jean-noel bossé says that problems with consumption at home are being compounded by a 10 % drop in french wine sales abroad , thanks to the strong euro and the competition from new world wines , which he believes appeal to a less sophisticated consumer .
" we are facing new producers of wine - australia , south africa , chile , newcomers on the market , " he says , " and these people are producing good wine , taking what they should take from the french experience and attacking our markets strongly . "
as a result , french wine-growers are now thinking the unthinkable - and discussing simplifying their current labelling by vineyard and perhaps even creating generic brand-names to challenge the new world upstarts abroad .
but above all , they want support from the french government .
and with regional elections coming up later this month , they may just find french mps suddenly re-acquiring a patriotic taste for helping this crucial national industry , rather than face the grapes of wrath at the polls .
