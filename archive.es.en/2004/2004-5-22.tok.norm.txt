bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .
last month daimlerchrysler signed an agreement with visting chinese prime minister wen jiabao in germany for the manufacturing of mercedes limousines of the c and e-class . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes , made in china the international automobile industry is pinning its hopes on china .
volkswagen , bmw and others are already making vehicles for chinese customers , and now daimlerchrysler has decided to enter the fray .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.05.2004 a modern fairy tale for spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe and letizia at the altar .
spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .

the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .
king juan carlos married his wife sofia in greece during the spanish dictatorship of gen. francisco franco . the spanish wedding comes only one week after denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frederik gets his mary denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .
king juan carlos married his wife sofia in greece during the spanish dictatorship of gen. francisco franco . the spanish wedding comes only one week after denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frederik gets his mary denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .
last month daimlerchrysler signed an agreement with visting chinese prime minister wen jiabao in germany for the manufacturing of mercedes limousines of the c and e-class . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes , made in china the international automobile industry is pinning its hopes on china .
volkswagen , bmw and others are already making vehicles for chinese customers , and now daimlerchrysler has decided to enter the fray .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .
king juan carlos married his wife sofia in greece during the spanish dictatorship of gen. francisco franco . the spanish wedding comes only one week after denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frederik gets his mary denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .

a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .

" foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .

" daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .
king juan carlos married his wife sofia in greece during the spanish dictatorship of gen. francisco franco . the spanish wedding comes only one week after denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frederik gets his mary denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .
hundreds of thousands cheered the couple in the danish capital 's tightly guarded streets .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .

" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

gesine schwan , the choice of social democrats and greens , is a political scientist and currently serves as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . as germany 's president is not elected directly , 1,205 members of the so-called federal assembly will choose between köhler and schwan in berlin on sunday .
the assembly includes all members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states , including many celebrities . köhler 's victory is all but certain as conservatives have a majority in the assembly .
but schwan has been leading in public opinion polls , raising the question whether some conservative voters in the assembly might forget party allegiances and elect a female president for the first time in the federal republic 's history . below you can find a compilation of dw-world articles on the search for germany 's next president . dw-world.de a mrs. president for germany ?

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .
last month daimlerchrysler signed an agreement with visting chinese prime minister wen jiabao in germany for the manufacturing of mercedes limousines of the c and e-class . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes , made in china the international automobile industry is pinning its hopes on china .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .

" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .

" foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .

" daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

spain 's crown prince felipe married former television presenter letizia ortiz on saturday in madrid 's almudena cathedral .
the couple was cheered on by crowds of spectators undeterred by pouring rain and tight security . in a traditional and ornate roman catholic service , felipe and letizia made their vows in front of 1,400 guests including heads of state and the members of several royal families .
the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .

the 31-year-old bride wore a high-collared ivory dress with a 4.5 meter train and the 36-year-old groom was decked out in military dress . due to the torrential rain , letizia was unable walk the red carpet from the royal palace to the cathedral , instead arriving in a rolls royce .
but the rain could not spoil the event which is being seen by many spaniards as a chance to put the deadly march 11 terrorist bombings in madrid behind the country . " this is a breath of fresh air after the attacks we suffered .
we need to get past this , " rosa coral from barcelona told reuters . around 20,000 police were on the streets of the spanish capital and nato surveillance planes patrolled the skies on saturday to ensure the security of what is considered by many royal watchers to be the most important society wedding since britain 's prince charles married lady diana . bildunterschrift : the ceremony marks the high point of a modern-day fairy-tale romance that has turned a career-minded commoner divorcee into spain 's future queen .
the marriage comes just a year after the couple began dating and only months after their engagement was made public in november . in a bow to tradition , felipe looked to his father king juan carlos before saying " yes " so the monarch could nod his assent to the nuptials .
the union of felipe and leitzia is the first royal wedding in spain in nearly a century .
the last was that of the prince 's great grandfather king alfonso xiii in 1906 .
king juan carlos married his wife sofia in greece during the spanish dictatorship of gen. francisco franco . the spanish wedding comes only one week after denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frederik gets his mary denmark 's crown prince frederik married australian-born mary donaldson in copenhagen on friday .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .

" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off .

" you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group .

" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .

there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers . the bavarian-based bmw group counts among the latecomers on the scene when it comes to setting up shop in the burgeoning chinese auto industry . while fellow german carmaker volkswagen began production in china in the mid 1980s and last year sold more cars in china than in its home market , bmw only formally opened its first production facility this week in shenyang , the capital of northeast china 's liaoning province . a joint venture with brilliance china automative holdings ltd , the € 450-million plant , which will produce both bmw 3-series and 5-series models , boasts a manufacturing system and technology as advanced as those found in other bmw factories around the world . bmw and brilliance each hold a 50 percent stake in the bmw brilliance automotive co .
ltd. joint venture , which was set up in july last year . " a milestone " helmut panke , bmw ceo , said the plant marked a defining moment for the company .
" to build one 's own production plant for the premium class deep in the chinese heartland is a milestone to make asia , after the u.s. , into the largest overseas market , " he said . panke stressed that bmw had learned from past experience that investing in local markets usually paid off . " just look at what we 've achieved in the u.s. where we decided to build a plant in the early 1990s - ten years on we 've quadrupled our sales , which makes it clear that investing directly brings totally different perspectives within a market , " he said . " you 're seen as a responsible investor , as a part of the economy and society .
we expect that in china too and in that sense shenyang is the second phase in the internationalization of the bmw group . " the shenyang plant aims to produce around 30,000 bmw 3-series and 5-series models in the medium term , employing about 3,000 staff . brilliance china automative holdings ltd chirman wu xiao 'an called the new plant a milestone for his company .
" our partnership with bmw is a crucial step for brilliance , " wu said .
" it signals the success of both our strategic partnership and the global vision of our company . " foreign carmakers queuing up china 's explosive growth , which has turned its car market into the fastest-growing in the world , has attracted foreign automakers in hordes . foreign carmakers led by volkswagen have invested more than $ 12 billion in china , with 13 automakers setting up 20 joint ventures . this week one of china 's big three car makers , dongfeng , which has a joint venture with nissan and another with peugeot citroen , said it was thinking of setting up a new one with renault . french carmaker peugeot confirmed it would double annual output to 300,000 , while german audi began importing its a8 saloon at an asking price of $ 232,000 . last year chinese car sales amounted to 2.1 million .
the chinese association of automobile manufacturers -lrb- cama -rrb- forecasts they will hit 5m by 2010 , the third-largest in the world behind the u.s. and japan . " the chinese market is developing extraordinarily dynamically .
there 's already a market for two million cars , in 2002 it was only one million .
that shows how robust the growth is , " panke said .
" and we think that even the premium segment will develop strongly in the next years and then we 'll have to see whether we need to broaden the production . " daimlerchrysler next in line for now the majority of the car components for the shenyang plant will be imported and the cars will be assembled under the guidance of 50 german experts .
however the factory will soon aim to localize about 40 percent of the production process . bmw has already had a taste of what the booming chinese market has to offer . in the first four months of this year the bmw group saw sales growth of 41.4 percent for its three brands - bmw , mini and roll-royce - in china produced locally by the joint venture using existing assembly lines .
bmw is thus the only carmaker in the premium segment that produces locally in china . it 's an example that others are hoping to emulate .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 22.05.2004 delegate 's nazi past clouds german presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger is the oldest member of the body that elects the president .
a decision by germany 's christian democrats to include a former state premier with a nazi past as a delegate for sunday 's presidential election has been harshly criticized by jewish groups and left-wing politicians . hans filbinger , 90 , was forced to resign as premier of the southern state of baden-württemberg in 1978 after it emerged that as a naval judge he shared responsibility for handing down death sentences in the waning months of nazi germany . filbinger ’ s opponents are criticizing that until today he ’ s kept defending his activities then .
" what was the law then can not be unlawful today , " is how filbinger has justified his position . the right-wing politician 's nomination by christian democrats to participate in sunday 's so-called federal assembly , which is comprised of members of parliament as well as an equal number of representatives from germany 's 16 states , has provoked outcry from members of germany 's governing coalition , intellectuals and jewish leaders . describing filbinger 's nomination as tasteless , klaus uwe benneter , the social democratic party 's secretary general , said conservatives were once again failing to swiftly deal with a touchy issue similar to the case of a far right-wing cdu parliamentarian who had called jewish people a " race of perpertrators " and was eventually excluded from his party 's parliamentary group late last year . paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany , who is also a cdu-nominated member of the federal assembly , said he did n't understand why filbinger had been chosen in the first place . " there must be more deserving people without such a past , " spiegel told berlin tabloid b.z. officials for the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center also voiced their concerns .
" filbinger 's participation in the presidential election would send the wrong signal at the wrong time and would be a stain on germany 's democratic record , " they said in a statement on their web site , urging people to write to christian democratic leader angela merkel to call for filbinger 's removal . criticism politically motivated ? christian democrats have countered that criticism of filbinger 's nomination is politically motivated .
they say that filbinger already was a member of several federal assemblies as former state premiers are traditionally invited to participate .
they add that his nomination was approved twice after his past came to light by all members of baden-württemberg 's state parliament , which also included social democrats and greens . election procedures also prevent the cdu from retracting the nomination - only filbinger himself could decide to stay away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's presidential candidates : gesine schwan , left , and horst köhler together with the neo-liberal free democrats , the cdu holds a majority in the federal assembly , making it highly likely that the conservative presidential candidate , former imf director horst köhler , will be chosen as germany 's next president on sunday .
köhler himself has also been nominated by baden-württemberg 's cdu as a member of the federal assembly . saying that germany needs a first female head of state , social democrats and greens have nominated gesine schwan , the president of viadrina european university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

spears and two of her security guards had been sued by masahiko shizawa for causing him " extreme emotional distress " over an incident in 2002 .
it followed a confrontation with the guards outside spears ' us home .
last year mr shizawa was found guilty by a us court of stalking spears and was ordered to stay 300m away from her .

he also sued the city of los angeles for allegedly taking away his dignity during a search of his hotel room .

she let stand the claims against guard robert feggans .

spears had sought a restraining order against the man in december 2002 , saying he tried to contact her at two of her homes and her parents ' house .

in many ways , 2003 was the year of the nintendo gamecube .
even though playstation 2 continued its tiresome dominance , and xbox had not started to push through , the key console titles of the year were metroid prime and the wind waker .
viewtiful joe followed them up as a lively , innovative experience , while over on the gameboy advance , advance wars 2 rounded off the package of top-notch , platform-specific titles .
so what has become of nintendo so far in 2004 ?
every week , a new announcement seems to talk about titles that are simply retooled reissues .
metal gear solid : the twin snakes was a big release , for example , but it was little more than a pretty remake of a three-year-old game .
although superb cross-platform games like the prince of persia : sands of time have found a home on gamecube , we have not had an in-house title that comes close to prime , wind waker or even mario sunshine .
brand new the frenzied activities around e3 included a preview of metroid prime 2 : echoes .
if the game builds on the superb foundation retro studios built with the first game , but successfully blends in new ploys and adds a four-player mode , it may well be another masterpiece . "
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation " but is that enough to keep nintendo an exciting brand ?
now , before all you nintendophiles jump down my throat , let us bear in mind that those of us keen on the brand 's franchises , characters and games may garner endless enjoyment from what is offered by a new mario kart , or a link-up of links .
but it may not be enough to keep the company at the forefront of the console market .
or , indeed , even in the console market .
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation .
today , frankly , nostalgia seems to have tipped the balance .
the ds may have a lot of potential , but some of nintendo 's plans smack of a company staring wistfully into the past .
i can not be the only one who finds that a bit depressing .
more than gimmicks i am not advocating that nintendo needs to dedicate all its energies to creating all-new games .
but if it is to survive in the fight against microsoft and sony , it needs to look more specifically beyond its established fan base .
the sony psp versus nintendo ds battle looks set to be very interesting .
nintendo 's extraordinary back catalogue will serve the ds well , but it will not be enough .
some promising info is trickling through .
sega , for example , is working on a ds game temporarily entitled project rub , which uses the handheld 's touchscreen for control .
it sounds intriguing , but games like this need to get beyond the gimmick factor .
sony 's eyetoy has proved it is possible .
so fingers crossed that nintendo finds the balance between familiarity and freshness .

nintendo 's dual screen handheld fuel innovative games in many ways , 2003 was the year of the nintendo gamecube .
even though playstation 2 continued its tiresome dominance , and xbox had not started to push through , the key console titles of the year were metroid prime and the wind waker .
viewtiful joe followed them up as a lively , innovative experience , while over on the gameboy advance , advance wars 2 rounded off the package of top-notch , platform-specific titles .
so what has become of nintendo so far in 2004 ?
every week , a new announcement seems to talk about titles that are simply retooled reissues .
metal gear solid : the twin snakes was a big release , for example , but it was little more than a pretty remake of a three-year-old game .
although superb cross-platform games like the prince of persia : sands of time have found a home on gamecube , we have not had an in-house title that comes close to prime , wind waker or even mario sunshine .

if the game builds on the superb foundation retro studios built with the first game , but successfully blends in new ploys and adds a four-player mode , it may well be another masterpiece .
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation discuss this story on bbc collective but is that enough to keep nintendo an exciting brand ?
now , before all you nintendophiles jump down my throat , let us bear in mind that those of us keen on the brand 's franchises , characters and games may garner endless enjoyment from what is offered by a new mario kart , or a link-up of links .

or , indeed , even in the console market .
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation .

the ds may have a lot of potential , but some of nintendo 's plans smack of a company staring wistfully into the past .
i can not be the only one who finds that a bit depressing .
more than gimmicks i am not advocating that nintendo needs to dedicate all its energies to creating all-new games .
sony is getting into handheld gaming with the psp but if it is to survive in the fight against microsoft and sony , it needs to look more specifically beyond its established fan base .
the sony psp versus nintendo ds battle looks set to be very interesting .
nintendo 's extraordinary back catalogue will serve the ds well , but it will not be enough .
some promising info is trickling through .
sega , for example , is working on a ds game temporarily entitled project rub , which uses the handheld 's touchscreen for control .

nintendo 's dual screen handheld fuel innovative games in many ways , 2003 was the year of the nintendo gamecube .
even though playstation 2 continued its tiresome dominance , and xbox had not started to push through , the key console titles of the year were metroid prime and the wind waker .
viewtiful joe followed them up as a lively , innovative experience , while over on the gameboy advance , advance wars 2 rounded off the package of top-notch , platform-specific titles .
so what has become of nintendo so far in 2004 ?
every week , a new announcement seems to talk about titles that are simply retooled reissues .
metal gear solid : the twin snakes was a big release , for example , but it was little more than a pretty remake of a three-year-old game .
although superb cross-platform games like the prince of persia : sands of time have found a home on gamecube , we have not had an in-house title that comes close to prime , wind waker or even mario sunshine .
brand new the frenzied activities around e3 included a preview of metroid prime 2 : echoes .
if the game builds on the superb foundation retro studios built with the first game , but successfully blends in new ploys and adds a four-player mode , it may well be another masterpiece .
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation discuss this story on bbc collective but is that enough to keep nintendo an exciting brand ?
now , before all you nintendophiles jump down my throat , let us bear in mind that those of us keen on the brand 's franchises , characters and games may garner endless enjoyment from what is offered by a new mario kart , or a link-up of links .
but it may not be enough to keep the company at the forefront of the console market .
or , indeed , even in the console market .
nintendo has always relied on the solidity of its brand icons , but they were balanced by innovation .
today , frankly , nostalgia seems to have tipped the balance .
the ds may have a lot of potential , but some of nintendo 's plans smack of a company staring wistfully into the past .
i can not be the only one who finds that a bit depressing .
more than gimmicks i am not advocating that nintendo needs to dedicate all its energies to creating all-new games .
sony is getting into handheld gaming with the psp but if it is to survive in the fight against microsoft and sony , it needs to look more specifically beyond its established fan base .
the sony psp versus nintendo ds battle looks set to be very interesting .
nintendo 's extraordinary back catalogue will serve the ds well , but it will not be enough .
some promising info is trickling through .
sega , for example , is working on a ds game temporarily entitled project rub , which uses the handheld 's touchscreen for control .
it sounds intriguing , but games like this need to get beyond the gimmick factor .
sony 's eyetoy has proved it is possible .
so fingers crossed that nintendo finds the balance between familiarity and freshness .

the bank of scotland study said that nearly 4 % of the country 's dwelling stock is currently unoccupied .
the institution has linked areas with a high incidence of empty homes to increased unemployment and urban deprivation .
it urged politicians to take action , but the scottish executive dismissed the figures as misleading , saying the majority of vacancies were temporary .
the research found that the highest numbers of scotland 's 87,000 empty homes are in glasgow and edinburgh .
however , measured as a proportion of local dwelling stock , the highest number of empty homes are in the western isles , where more than 7 % of properties are vacant .
making an area more attractive to live in should significantly reduce the number of empty homes there tim crawford bank of scotland economist aberdeen and orkney also have high proportional results , with 6.6 % and 6.1 % of homes lying empty respectively .
areas with the lowest proportion of empty homes include east dunbartonshire , midlothian and west lothian .
the report claims that areas where more than 5 % of the dwelling stock is vacant have a higher than average unemployment rate .
it also claims average earnings and house prices are lower in such areas .
tim crawford , an economist with the bank of scotland , said : " empty homes and urban deprivation go hand in hand .
government policy , in our view , needs to tackle urban blight and the empty homes problem at the same time .
' temporary ' vacancies " making an area more attractive to live in should significantly reduce the number of empty homes there . "
but a scottish executive spokesman said the figures released by the bank did not tell the full story .
" the vast majority of scotland 's empty properties are only temporarily vacant as households move from one to another after completion of sale or a letting agreement , " he said .
" over half of vacant properties are unoccupied for less than six months .
" we expect local authorities to take any local problems into account when developing and implementing their local housing strategies . "

it was a triumph for their leader , italian-born sonia gandhi , particularly as she had been mercilessly attacked during the campaign by her opponents because of her foreign origin .
early trends from the counting of ballots indicated an election upset but mrs gandhi had no intention of becoming prime minister .
it all began with just the faintest ripple on the pond .
wax seals on the locks of the strong-room at the election counting office in delhi had been broken , the key had been turned in the padlock , and a dozen election officials sweating in 100-plus degree temperatures had heaved the electronic voting machines onto tables in the heavily guarded counting arena .
at the press of a button , they started to spill out their digital secrets .
here in the capital , congress were doing far , far better than anyone had expected .
i phoned the bbc bureau in delhi , and above the cacophony of party agents , election officials and journalists , i shouted into my mobile : " there 's a surprise going on here . "
sanjoy in the office shouted back that there were surprises going on all over india .
those ripples - now waves - were spreading out across the whole of this vast country , unleashing one of the most extraordinary political dramas ever in india .
against the odds it is difficult now - just a matter of days later - to recall the exact sequence of events that followed .
so much happened so quickly .
but one thing seemed certain : the architect of the congress party triumph , sonia gandhi , would become prime minister .
sonia gandhi lent her support to prime minister-designate 71-year-old manmohan singh she had taken volley after volley of the most unpleasant and offensive abuse during the campaign .
the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- - the ousted governing party - had wheeled out some of their most accomplished , acid-tongued demagogues to attack her .
not her politics or her record , but the woman herself , and her italian origins .
sonia gandhi had remained calm and resolute and she had won the election in the face of this vitriol .
so it was against this background that she made her first appearance at the presidential palace in delhi the following day , we thought , to accept the request to form a government .
she emerged after a 20 minute meeting with president abdul kalam and stepped in front of a forest of microphones that reporters had planted outside .
it was then that the doubts began .
stunned she did not look like a woman about to take control of the levers of power .
her talk was of another meeting with the president and further negotiations with alliance partners to ensure a majority in parliament .
congress party supporters protest against mrs gandhi 's decision she clambered back into the white ambassadorial car and as she was driven away down rajpath - the wide avenue in front of the palace - the cohort of reporters stared at each other in amazement .
at congress party headquarters about a mile away , ever-growing numbers of supporters had been whooping and cheering , and waving flags and posters non-stop for three days .
but here , the whispers started to circulate .
could it be true ?
was their adored leader having second thoughts ?
i am in awe of the energy and devotion of some of the congress faithful .
govinder is one of them .
it had taken him 12 hours on an array of bicycles , cars , buses and trains to get to delhi from his home in uttar pradesh .
another enduring image was of a man standing on top of a car holding a pistol against his head he wanted to be in his capital city for the moment that his leader sonia-ji was sworn in as prime minister .
in the meantime he saw it as his job to lead a group of fanatics at party headquarters in a ceaseless inferno of cheering and shouting .
he paused only briefly at night to grab a couple of hours sleep on the pavement , lying on a campaign poster with a kerbstone as a pillow .
the frenzy he erupted into when he was told that sonia-ji did not want to be prime minister was something to behold .
shocking scenes another enduring image was of a man - a former mp - standing on top of a car holding a pistol against his head , declaring he would kill himself if sonia did not become prime minister .
congress party supporters crowded around a burning effigy of sushma swaraj , leader of the outgoing bjp i have not seen him since , but i am told he survived .
apparently he discharged his weapon , but missed and injured his leg .
the fevered madness of the past few days is diminishing .
crowds who vowed they would never leave the street outside congress hq until sonia gandhi became leader have faced facts , packed up their belongings and headed home .
the intense political activity is now all about who gets what cabinet post in the new government , and i am left dazed .
i ponder on how a woman almost single-handedly led her party to victory in the world 's largest democracy , saying all along that she had no desire to be prime minister .
she apparently came within a whisker of taking the job , and then decided not to .
the real reasons for that decision will probably only be known when sonia gandhi writes her autobiography .
but out of this chaos and crisis her enemies have been humbled and scattered , and she has emerged the unchallenged champion of all india - a true gandhi .

the stadium replaces the morfa stadium which has been knocked down to accommodate it .
