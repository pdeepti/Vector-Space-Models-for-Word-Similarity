germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .
his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .
the eu also has implented arms embargoes against myanmar -lrb- burma , -rrb- sudan and zimbabwe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .

cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .

austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .

his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .
the eu also has implented arms embargoes against myanmar -lrb- burma , -rrb- sudan and zimbabwe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .

“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

british prime minister tony blair claimed a narrow victory on tuesday evening as the conservative opposition and rebels in his own party were defeated on the student fees vote . prime minister tony blair survived a rebellion within his own party to narrowly avoid a defeat rebellion in the house of commons on tuesday on the controversial debate surrounding plans to increase university fees . the embattled premier , facing the hardest week in his six year tenure as prime minister , watched as a last-minute campaign to secure backing for the much criticized legislation paid off when 316 lawmakers voted in favor , while 311 voted against .
labour lawmakers cheered loudly as the result was announced . a defeat would have been blair 's first in parliament since taking office in 1997 and would have put him in the position where a no confidence vote put forward by opposition conservatives and labour rebels may have unseated him . blair looks towards hutton report the victory offered the prime minister a brief reprieve during one of the tensest weeks of his leadership .
on wednesday , lord hutton is due to publish his report into the death of david kelly , the weapons adviser caught up in a controversy over the government 's justification of the war in iraq .
recent polls suggest that if the report implies that blair lied over whether he sanctioned the leaking of dr. kelly ’ s identity , most britons will call for his resignation ; a call that would be greatly amplified by his opponents . tuesday 's vote meant the tuition fees bill passed its second reading , which is an agreement on its basic principles .
it next goes before a committee of lawmakers who consider the legislation in detail and suggest possible changes before submitting it to a third reading in the commons . if approved at that stage , the bill moves to the house of lords , which can delay or amend the legislation but not block it .
the proposal becomes law after winning the backing of both houses and receiving royal assent . wednesday ’ s events may decide whether tony blair will still be in office to see that happen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair ’ s “ week from hell “ british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .
his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

deisler , 24 , booked into the max-planck institute in november last year as constant injuries and the media spotlight took their toll on the star .
the young man who promised to usher in a new golden era of german soccer with his inventive play transferred from hertha berlin to the bundesliga champions for € 9.2 million in 2002 but has played only a handful of games after recurring knee problems kept him on the sidelines .
the frustration and speculation surrounding his stalled career forced the german international into a nine-week stint out of the game but has now taken his first steps to recovery .

around 80 percent of germans have committed tax evasion at least once in their lives , according to a survey by the hamburg-based research institute gewis .
asked whether they had ever had the feeling that the financial authorities demanded too much tax , 79 percent of respondents answered " yes . "
to the follow-up question of whether they had ever withheld taxable income for this reason , four-fifths again responded with " yes . "
on a more general note , according to 96 percent of the 1084 men and women surveyed , germany is a far too regimented society .
that 's why 89 percent of those asked said they no longer take the country 's 85,000 laws and regulations seriously . more briefs 27.01.2004 -pipe- bmw blames falling revenue on weak dollar 26.01.2004 -pipe- new german cinema giant in the making 26.01.2004 -pipe- eu air travelers get more rights 26.01.2004 -pipe- britain wants airbus tanker planes 22.01.2004 -pipe- vw sells more cars in china than germany 21.01.2004 -pipe- mail-order giant otto to cut hundreds of jobs 21.01.2004 -pipe- tui plans ipo for hapag-lloyd shipping business 21.01.2004 -pipe- germany wants to sell gold for education , research 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 germany blocks eu parliament pay reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the current pay system for european parliament deputies is open to fraud .
germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

deisler , 24 , booked into the max-planck institute in november last year as constant injuries and the media spotlight took their toll on the star .
the young man who promised to usher in a new golden era of german soccer with his inventive play transferred from hertha berlin to the bundesliga champions for € 9.2 million in 2002 but has played only a handful of games after recurring knee problems kept him on the sidelines .
the frustration and speculation surrounding his stalled career forced the german international into a nine-week stint out of the game but has now taken his first steps to recovery .
" sebastian will slowly step up his training regime , " explained bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld to reporters .
" he will train twice daily with our physiotherapist oliver schmidtlein watching on .

around 80 percent of germans have committed tax evasion at least once in their lives , according to a survey by the hamburg-based research institute gewis .
asked whether they had ever had the feeling that the financial authorities demanded too much tax , 79 percent of respondents answered " yes . "
to the follow-up question of whether they had ever withheld taxable income for this reason , four-fifths again responded with " yes . "
on a more general note , according to 96 percent of the 1084 men and women surveyed , germany is a far too regimented society .
that 's why 89 percent of those asked said they no longer take the country 's 85,000 laws and regulations seriously . more briefs 27.01.2004 -pipe- bmw blames falling revenue on weak dollar 26.01.2004 -pipe- new german cinema giant in the making 26.01.2004 -pipe- eu air travelers get more rights 26.01.2004 -pipe- britain wants airbus tanker planes 22.01.2004 -pipe- vw sells more cars in china than germany 21.01.2004 -pipe- mail-order giant otto to cut hundreds of jobs 21.01.2004 -pipe- tui plans ipo for hapag-lloyd shipping business 21.01.2004 -pipe- germany wants to sell gold for education , research 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 germany blocks eu parliament pay reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the current pay system for european parliament deputies is open to fraud .
germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 france and china cozy up chinese president hu jintao is in france this week on a state visit .
his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .
the eu also has implented arms embargoes against myanmar -lrb- burma , -rrb- sudan and zimbabwe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 .

“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .

“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

his host , french president jacques chirac , is making a clear effort to get on beijing 's good side . hu jintao ’ s current visit to france is turning out to be somewhat of a love fest : celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , the chinese leader has been granted the rare honor of addressing the national assembly .
hu will also inaugurate france 's " year of china , " aimed at arousing awareness of the communist country 's emergence as an economic giant . paris has lit up its eiffel tower in red to mark the visit as well as the beginning of the chinese new year . in china , the commencing “ year of the monkey ” is expected to be a prosperous one in terms of economic success and france seems to be interested in getting in on the action .
france ’ s 2003 trade volume with china amounted to $ 13 billion -lrb- € 10.4 billion -rrb- , about a third of the chinese-german total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , foreground left , gestures as china 's president hu jintao , right , waves upon hu 's arrival at orly airport , south of paris , monday , jan .
26 , 2004 .
“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

deisler , 24 , booked into the max-planck institute in november last year as constant injuries and the media spotlight took their toll on the star .
the young man who promised to usher in a new golden era of german soccer with his inventive play transferred from hertha berlin to the bundesliga champions for € 9.2 million in 2002 but has played only a handful of games after recurring knee problems kept him on the sidelines .
the frustration and speculation surrounding his stalled career forced the german international into a nine-week stint out of the game but has now taken his first steps to recovery .
" sebastian will slowly step up his training regime , " explained bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld to reporters .
" he will train twice daily with our physiotherapist oliver schmidtlein watching on .

deisler , 24 , booked into the max-planck institute in november last year as constant injuries and the media spotlight took their toll on the star .
the young man who promised to usher in a new golden era of german soccer with his inventive play transferred from hertha berlin to the bundesliga champions for € 9.2 million in 2002 but has played only a handful of games after recurring knee problems kept him on the sidelines .
the frustration and speculation surrounding his stalled career forced the german international into a nine-week stint out of the game but has now taken his first steps to recovery .
" sebastian will slowly step up his training regime , " explained bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld to reporters .
" he will train twice daily with our physiotherapist oliver schmidtlein watching on .

but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

british prime minister tony blair claimed a narrow victory on tuesday evening as the conservative opposition and rebels in his own party were defeated on the student fees vote . prime minister tony blair survived a rebellion within his own party to narrowly avoid a defeat rebellion in the house of commons on tuesday on the controversial debate surrounding plans to increase university fees . the embattled premier , facing the hardest week in his six year tenure as prime minister , watched as a last-minute campaign to secure backing for the much criticized legislation paid off when 316 lawmakers voted in favor , while 311 voted against .
labour lawmakers cheered loudly as the result was announced . a defeat would have been blair 's first in parliament since taking office in 1997 and would have put him in the position where a no confidence vote put forward by opposition conservatives and labour rebels may have unseated him . blair looks towards hutton report the victory offered the prime minister a brief reprieve during one of the tensest weeks of his leadership .
on wednesday , lord hutton is due to publish his report into the death of david kelly , the weapons adviser caught up in a controversy over the government 's justification of the war in iraq .
recent polls suggest that if the report implies that blair lied over whether he sanctioned the leaking of dr. kelly ’ s identity , most britons will call for his resignation ; a call that would be greatly amplified by his opponents . tuesday 's vote meant the tuition fees bill passed its second reading , which is an agreement on its basic principles .
it next goes before a committee of lawmakers who consider the legislation in detail and suggest possible changes before submitting it to a third reading in the commons . if approved at that stage , the bill moves to the house of lords , which can delay or amend the legislation but not block it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 germany blocks eu parliament pay reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the current pay system for european parliament deputies is open to fraud .
germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .
now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg .

“ this visit gives us the chance to open a new phase in our partnership , ” chirac said after picking up his guest at the airport on monday .
“ our aim is to further strengthen ties which are already good at the political and cultural level and which could be developed on the economic front . ” besides stronger economic cooperation , both countries also hope to get support from each other against the world ’ s only remaining superpower , valerie nique , an expert on china at the institute for international and strategic studies in paris , told german public broadcaster saarländischer rundfunk . “ france considers china important to assert herself against u.s. hegemony , ” nique said .
“ it ’ s similar in the reverse .
china fears that washington wants to take on a military role in asia .
that ’ s why china needs france in the u.n. security council against u.s. hegemony . ” chirac supports “ one china ” policy to show france ’ s support of china , chirac reiterated his backing of beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy as taiwan is preparing to hold a referendum on arming itself against a possible attack from the mainland .
like most other countries , including the united states and germany , france does not recognize taiwan as an independent state .
china considers the referendum an unacceptable step toward independence . a referendum “ would be a grave mistake , ” chirac said , adding that taiwan would bear responsibility for cracks in the region ’ s stability should it go ahead with the plan on march 20 . france lobbies eu to end arms embargo chirac on tuesday also called for an end to the eu 's 14-year-old arms embargo against china , which was established after beijing ’ s brutal crackdown on the 1989 student demonstrations in tiananmen square .
" it makes absolutely no sense today , " chirac said , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin earlier this week , french foreign minister dominique de villepin -lrb- photo -rrb- pushed his eu colleagues to end the embargo .
but at least sweden and the netherlands seem opposed to such a move , saying that the human rights situation in china still does not warrant an end to the arms embargo . one brussels diplomat quoted by reuters news agency even said the proposal had little chance to succeed .
“ nobody backed it , ” he said .
“ most countries said it posed problems for them . ” but eu foreign relations representative javier solana said it was probably time to rethink the embargo .
“ " if you take the list of countries with whom we have embargos of arms , probably china is not in the company it should be , " he said , adding that chinese leadership had changed since tiananmen .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

british prime minister tony blair claimed a narrow victory on tuesday evening as the conservative opposition and rebels in his own party were defeated on the student fees vote . prime minister tony blair survived a rebellion within his own party to narrowly avoid a defeat rebellion in the house of commons on tuesday on the controversial debate surrounding plans to increase university fees . the embattled premier , facing the hardest week in his six year tenure as prime minister , watched as a last-minute campaign to secure backing for the much criticized legislation paid off when 316 lawmakers voted in favor , while 311 voted against .
labour lawmakers cheered loudly as the result was announced . a defeat would have been blair 's first in parliament since taking office in 1997 and would have put him in the position where a no confidence vote put forward by opposition conservatives and labour rebels may have unseated him . blair looks towards hutton report the victory offered the prime minister a brief reprieve during one of the tensest weeks of his leadership .
on wednesday , lord hutton is due to publish his report into the death of david kelly , the weapons adviser caught up in a controversy over the government 's justification of the war in iraq .
recent polls suggest that if the report implies that blair lied over whether he sanctioned the leaking of dr. kelly ’ s identity , most britons will call for his resignation ; a call that would be greatly amplified by his opponents . tuesday 's vote meant the tuition fees bill passed its second reading , which is an agreement on its basic principles .
it next goes before a committee of lawmakers who consider the legislation in detail and suggest possible changes before submitting it to a third reading in the commons . if approved at that stage , the bill moves to the house of lords , which can delay or amend the legislation but not block it .
the proposal becomes law after winning the backing of both houses and receiving royal assent . wednesday ’ s events may decide whether tony blair will still be in office to see that happen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair ’ s “ week from hell “ british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2004 germany blocks eu parliament pay reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the current pay system for european parliament deputies is open to fraud .
germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june . efforts to reform the european parliament 's pay system for its deputies have been under way since 1998 .
but there 's still no end in sight , following the collapse of pay reform talks in brussels on monday .
the majority of members of the european parliament -lrb- mep 's -rrb- would welcome reforms .
the system has earned itself a bad reputation for being open to fraud .
the expenses system is not based on actual costs supported by receipts .
an mep who flies to brussels with a budget airline , for example , could get away with claiming the highest air fare , thereby pocketing the difference .
the relaxed expenses system has long been used to narrow the differences in salaries between mep 's who are paid the same as their national lawmakers .
inequality the discrepancies are huge .
italian mep 's earn the most with a salary of around € 12,000 -lrb- $ 14,960 -rrb- a month , while their spanish counterparts earn around € 3,000 .
the differences will become even greater when mep 's from the eu 's new accession countries join the ranks .
hungarian mep 's will earn € 800 a month , while lithuanian deputies can expect to take home around € 350 .
european parliament president pat cox fought for a deal to standardize pay among mep 's in return for switching to a real expenses system , backed up with receipts .
but germany , joined by france , sweden and austria , argued that the proposed new deputies ' salaries of around € 9,000 a month were too generous , and vetoed key parts of the proposal .
cox said their decision was deeply disappointing .
bad timing for germany german foreign minister joschka fischer put germany 's resistance down to bad timing .
he said the government ca n't back what would be a substantial pay rise for german mep 's when it 's pushing through harsh reforms and cuts in health care at home .
german mep 's currently receive a monthly salary of € 7,000 .
fischer tried to highlight the positive .
" this gives the parliamentarians the opportunity to argue their position in the election campaign , " he said , referring to eu-wide elections in june .
swedish foreign minister laila freivalds said she blocked the reform proposals because the standardized salary would mean that swedish mep 's would earn double that of sweden 's national lawmakers .
austria called the reforms a " step in the right direction , " but also expressed concern that the proposed salaries – calculated as half the salary of a judge in the european court of justive – were too high .
the failure of eu states to reach an agreement on monday means the current pay and expenses system is set to continue .
it is up to the european parliament 's court to decide whether to propose a whole new draft resolution .
but that would be a time intensive procedure , and as parliament stops it 's legislation session at the end of april , it 's almost certain that pay reform will become a campaign issue in june . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .

around 80 percent of germans have committed tax evasion at least once in their lives , according to a survey by the hamburg-based research institute gewis .
asked whether they had ever had the feeling that the financial authorities demanded too much tax , 79 percent of respondents answered " yes . "
to the follow-up question of whether they had ever withheld taxable income for this reason , four-fifths again responded with " yes . "
on a more general note , according to 96 percent of the 1084 men and women surveyed , germany is a far too regimented society .
that 's why 89 percent of those asked said they no longer take the country 's 85,000 laws and regulations seriously . more briefs 27.01.2004 -pipe- bmw blames falling revenue on weak dollar 26.01.2004 -pipe- new german cinema giant in the making 26.01.2004 -pipe- eu air travelers get more rights 26.01.2004 -pipe- britain wants airbus tanker planes 22.01.2004 -pipe- vw sells more cars in china than germany 21.01.2004 -pipe- mail-order giant otto to cut hundreds of jobs 21.01.2004 -pipe- tui plans ipo for hapag-lloyd shipping business 21.01.2004 -pipe- germany wants to sell gold for education , research radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a command signal is to be sent from the american mars odyssey orbiter to try to reboot the probe 's onboard computer .
but the project 's chief scientist , professor colin pillinger , described it as a " last resort " .
beagle 2 landed on the red planet on christmas day , and the project team admit that after hearing nothing from it since , the probe is probably lost .
long shot if beagle 2 is still intact on the martian surface and capable of receiving the message , the reboot command could just kick-start it into communicating .
professor pillinger wants to send more beagles to mars but professor pillinger said it was a long shot .
" if it gets through , it will tell beagle to switch off and reload the software , " he explained .
" we are now working on the basis that there is a corrupt system and the only way we might resurrect it is to send that command . "
professor pillinger said the repeated failure to contact beagle using three orbiters and earth-based radio telescopes meant the chances of getting a signal from the craft were very slim .
future ' pups ' the mission team has now started to look at what might have gone wrong and a board of inquiry will also be set up by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
a key to this investigation will be getting an image showing beagle or its landing components on the surface .
the head of science at esa , professor david southwood , told bbc news online : " mars has something of a jinx for spacecraft .
" there is a long history of investigations of failed mars missions .
we want to make sure we add to the lessons learned . "
professor pillinger and his colleagues are keen to send " pups " of beagle to mars in 2007 .
they believe the experiments they sent on the probe to look for martian life were first class and deserve a second chance .

it comes after the sinking of cargo vessel , the jambo , which ran aground near the summer isles in june .
' useful and constructive ' the jambo was carrying 3,300 tonnes of zinc sulphide and 84 tonnes of marine diesel when it hit rocks off wester ross .
the councils criticised the subsequent jambo clean-up operation , which left about 1,500 tonnes of zinc on the sea bed .
both local authorities called on the uk government to designate the minches a maritime environment high risk area .
a department of transport spokeswoman described the meeting with mr jamieson as " useful and constructive " .

she added : " it was also agreed that each one of the points raised in our joint submission on safety will be fully analysed . "
both councils also called for the minches to be awarded particularly sensitive sea area status , to enable the government to establish international rules and standards to control shipping in the area .
the authorities also want extra restrictions in the area for vessels carrying more than 2,500 tonnes of oil as bunkers or cargo .
these include banning single-hulled vessels , making recommended routes mandatory and requiring vessels carrying hazardous cargo to report at certain points throughout their passage . "

that 's according to new research commissioned by the food standards agency .
but the fsa has also found that parents ' role in keeping their children healthy is being undermined by constant adverts for junk food , targeted at children .
to put the fsa 's findings to the test , breakfast put the kids in charge of the family shop .
we sent four children to do the supermarket run , armed with £ 40 .
their mum , kamanza amiyhia , tries to make sure the children eat a balanced diet .
but left to their own devices , her two sets of twins choose a mountain of sugary cereals , processed foods and fizzy drinks .
they also picked a grapefruit - we think they liked the colour. click here to watch breakfast 's shopping experiment home cooking how can you get children to eat their greens - or appreciate proper food ?
we talked to the chef anthony worrall thompson .
a recording of our interview will be available soon we also talked to an academic who 's been looking at the role our hormones play in obesity .
professor steve bloom explained that some obese people lack a hormone which tells them that they 've eaten enough .
in future , it may be possible to synthesise it - but he still believes that a healthy life-style is the key to avoiding obesity. click here to watch breakfast 's interview in full and : we want to know what you think about junk food and advertising. click here to jump straight to our e-mail form britain 's waistline has been expanding rapidly for the past quarter of a century .
nearly one in four women is now clinically obese - and experts are warning the figure could rise to 40 per cent within the next few years .
teenagers are also podging out : 15 per cent of 15 year olds are already classed as obese .
the fsa has found that food adverts aimed at children are dominated by just four types of product : sugary breakfast cereals , soft drinks , sweets and snacks .
it says there 's also been a big rise in advertising by fast food chains , which use free gifts to tempt youngsters through their doors .
do we only have ourselves to blame if we 're fat - or does fast food advertising put temptation in our way ?

merseyside police has developed a new policy for its approach to issues affecting the community .
people are being urged to contact the force , in confidence , with any problems or issues they have .
until now issues affecting the community are normally dealt with as part of the lesbian , gay and bisexual support work the police offers .
however , the force has decided transgender issues are " entirely different " and deserving of recognition in their own right .
' duty to protect ' sergeant chris wathan , from the force 's community relations unit , said : " some people in merseyside suffer assault , harassment , verbal abuse or other hostility because of their actual or perceived gender identity .
" we have a duty to protect those in society who are vulnerable to such victimisation .
" all these incidents will be dealt with thoroughly , sensitively and confidentially .
" people who carry out such acts should be left in no doubt their behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . "
the new approach means officers will receive training in how to treat transgender men and women .
members of the transgender community have welcomed the new approach .
' proactive , positive ' rebecca dittman , who advises the police on transgender issues , helped draw the policy up .
she told bbc news online : " as a transgender person i welcome any initiative to try to address the complex issues people like me face .
" officers often have anxiety in dealing with people like me . "
she said she felt the police were approaching the policy in a " proactive and positive way " .
but added not all members of the transgender community had had the same experience .
" i would hope having a policy like this will make merseyside police more attractive , " she said .

merseyside police has developed a new policy for its approach to issues affecting the community .
people are being urged to contact the force , in confidence , with any problems or issues they have .
until now issues affecting the community are normally dealt with as part of the lesbian , gay and bisexual support work the police offers .
however , the force has decided transgender issues are " entirely different " and deserving of recognition in their own right .
' duty to protect ' sergeant chris wathan , from the force 's community relations unit , said : " some people in merseyside suffer assault , harassment , verbal abuse or other hostility because of their actual or perceived gender identity .
" we have a duty to protect those in society who are vulnerable to such victimisation .
" all these incidents will be dealt with thoroughly , sensitively and confidentially .
" people who carry out such acts should be left in no doubt their behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . "
the new approach means officers will receive training in how to treat transgender men and women .
members of the transgender community have welcomed the new approach .
' proactive , positive ' rebecca dittman , who advises the police on transgender issues , helped draw the policy up .
she told bbc news online : " as a transgender person i welcome any initiative to try to address the complex issues people like me face .
" officers often have anxiety in dealing with people like me . "
she said she felt the police were approaching the policy in a " proactive and positive way " .
but added not all members of the transgender community had had the same experience .
" i would hope having a policy like this will make merseyside police more attractive , " she said .

merseyside police has developed a new policy for its approach to issues affecting the community .
people are being urged to contact the force , in confidence , with any problems or issues they have .
until now issues affecting the community are normally dealt with as part of the lesbian , gay and bisexual support work the police offers .
however , the force has decided transgender issues are " entirely different " and deserving of recognition in their own right .
' duty to protect ' sergeant chris wathan , from the force 's community relations unit , said : " some people in merseyside suffer assault , harassment , verbal abuse or other hostility because of their actual or perceived gender identity .
" we have a duty to protect those in society who are vulnerable to such victimisation .
" all these incidents will be dealt with thoroughly , sensitively and confidentially .
" people who carry out such acts should be left in no doubt their behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . "
the new approach means officers will receive training in how to treat transgender men and women .
members of the transgender community have welcomed the new approach .
' proactive , positive ' rebecca dittman , who advises the police on transgender issues , helped draw the policy up .
she told bbc news online : " as a transgender person i welcome any initiative to try to address the complex issues people like me face .
" officers often have anxiety in dealing with people like me . "
she said she felt the police were approaching the policy in a " proactive and positive way " .

the check is the third in three years , as the government tries to sort out the multi-trillion yen bad debt problem .
the concern is that some big borrowers may be in worse financial health than the banks have admitted .
earlier this week shares in several banks were hit hard by rumours of an upcoming investigation .
ufj , the smallest of japan 's big four banks , saw its shares slide 12 % on 26 january after rumours that it was to be singled out .
heizo takenaka , the technocrat economics and financial services minister in charge of the clean-up , said a special team would examine the books of borrowers as well as the banks ' own records .
" we have been aiming to resolve the problem of banks ' balance sheets and bad loans this fiscal year , " he said .
" ideally , we would n't have to conduct these inspections , but for that , we need to make more of an effort and so do the banks . "
slowdown the last time the financial services agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- investigated bad debts , it downgraded the status of 27 out of 167 borrowers at 11 major banks , forcing them to push up their acknowledged losses on bad debts by 1.3 trillion yen .
official estimates for the total debt burden top out at 50 trillion yen -lrb- $ 470bn ; £ 260bn -rrb- , but some private sector economists believe it could be four times higher .
the huge sums are the result of scattergun lending during the 1980s boom years , when banks often lent to companies with which they were allied without proper security .
now , though , the debts are hobbling the banking system , and slowing down investment just when japan - finally crawling out of a decade of stagnant performance if not outright recession - needs it the most .

while the welsh assembly government has begun offering grants of up to £ 50,000 to encourage dentists to set up practices in areas where the shortages are worst , a team from pembrokeshire 's local health boards is combing recruitment fairs as far afield as london to try to find more dentists .
it is concerned at the level of take-up of the assembly scheme in its area .
of the six new dental practices to result from the scheme in the past two years , none has been in the county , although the initiative has enabled a practice in milford haven to expand .
by talking to newly -qualified dentists from across the uk in person , the health officials hope to persuade them to practise in pembrokeshire .
the county has one of the highest number of vacancies for nhs dentists in wales .
stuart moncur , of pembrokeshire local health board , said there were several reasons for the high number of dentist vacancies .
he said : " we probably have n't been training enough dentists nationally .
" there is certainly a tendency for more dentists to look at options around private dentistry .
" and also there is an issue about general trends in dentistry where we 've got far more people working in other areas of dentistry , including hospitals . "
the extent of the shortage of dentists in some parts of rural wales became clear in july 2003 when 600 people queued to take up the nhs places on offer at a new practice in carmarthen .
and in october last year , the british dental association -lrb- bda -rrb- warned there was a severe shortage of dentists in wales with the situation unlikely to improve without financial support to persuade new practices to open up .

the european commission has finished drafting its decision in the case it brought against the software giant .
the commission is likely to decide that the firm illegally tied audio and video software , as well as server systems , to its windows operating system .
while continuing talks with microsoft , it is now circulating the decision to the parties involved .
" there is a draft on the table and this should come as no surprise , after all the investigation has been going on for long enough , " said amelia torres , spokeswoman for competition commissioner mario monti .
" the final stage was the hearing in november and now we have to conclude . "
us case although the draft has yet to be revealed , few observers think microsoft will come off unscathed .
the company has already been found by a us court to have broken anti-trust rules , and is now operating under a set of restrictions imposed as part of a deal with the justice department .
but the restrictions have been criticised as too lax , and the judge who presided over their resolution said last week they had - at least in part - failed to open up the market for computer software .
the eu is likely to want to go further .
penalties according to the financial times , the eu will want to fine microsoft heavily , and may demand that it stops forcing suppliers to include its own media software at the expense of competitors such as real networks and apple .
it is also probable that the company will be forced to reveal more information to its competitors about how its operating system interacts with others and with software applications .
the ft says the decision should be released by 1 may .

sales at comet went up by 3.9 % over the two months to 3 january , beating analysts ' expectations .
but the firm 's french market leader darty , which is battling weak consumer demand , saw sales growth of just 0.3 % .
profit margins were slightly down but kesa , formerly the electrical retail arm of kingfisher , said it would still meet full-year profit targets .
